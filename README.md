# CIA CREST Archive Explorer (cia-crest-explorer)
Exploring the CIA CREST Archive (https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/crest-25-year-program-archive) through Document Clustering.

## 1. Introduction
Welcome! The CREST Explorer is a tool that allows you to OCR and cluster documents. In particular, we focus on the CIA CREST Archive of declassified documents.

To get started, we OCRed ~1000 documents. You are welcome to add more documents from the archive or correct the OCR errors on the current documents. If you do, please submit a pull request, we would love to get as much help as we can :)

Below you can find a breakdown of the tool and a guide on how to use it.


## 2. How to use this tool
You will find three folders and a script in the main project folder.
