[Text] Until 1979, South Korea experienced spectacular economic development:
the GNP increased by an average of lo percent a year from 1970 to 1980, and
some targets of the 1377-1981 Five-Year Plan were achieved in 2 years. That
country had thus become a genuine modern industrial power, making effective
use of its labor. and having a good supervisory staff. However. in U79 and
particularly in 1980, Korea's growth slowed because of numerous economic and
political difficulties. In 1980, for the first time, it had a negative rate
of economic ngth: 5.7 percent. This situation did not continue, however,
because South Korea changed its policy, and the positive results oi the re-
r‘orms appeared in l98l. It is estiuted that the rate of grouth in the GNP
will be 7.1 percent in l98l. lbreover, inflation stabilized in l981.

French-Korean trade relations have been characterised by major contracts.
However, indications are that the developnent of Korean industry will con-
vinca that country to handle the supervision of projects itself. and that the
major projects will gradually give way to individual sales of capital goods.
In order to develop a better understanding of Korea and of Preach opportun-
ities for trade with Korea, the French Center for Foreign Trade on 18 March
organized an information day in Peri: led by Jean-Marc Bernard, commercial
counselor in the French hbassy in Seoul.

For our part, in order to provide inter-tion on Korea's economic relations
with Africa, we are presenting a previously unpublished survey to inform both
Africa and Europe about what Korea exports and obtains, and by what means, in
an increasing number or African countries, and to explain the features of
South Korean deve lopnent.

All of South Korea's policy is motivated by two main considerations: to

counter everywhere the efforts of. North Korea, and to develop exports at all
costs.

The Seoul government certainly could not ignore the African continent, and
over some is years of enterprising efforts it has built up a remarkable posi-
tion. It has developed interests which, though not yet subszantial, neverthe-
less occupy a not insignificant place in Korea's policy, economy, and planning.

The South Korean Economy: Grosth and Vitality

By way of introduction, it should be recalled that the country's economy has
shown astounding growth and vitality during the past 25 years. The following
are the main statistics.

In 1953, just prior to the war that devastated it, South Korea was in a state
of absolute poverty, which was even more disturbing since the southern part
of the Peninsula is devoid of any sipiiicant natural wealth, and particu-
Larly any energy resources.

with an area of 98,807 sq km, comparable to the Netherlands, Iceland, and
Portugal, South Korea today has a population of 38 nillion, or 38!. per sq ins,
making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world. The
growth rate is 1.6 percent. The urban population now totals 57.2 percent of
the total, with 1.2.8 percent still in the rural areas. The city of Seoul
alone has 8.5 million people, or 22.36 percent of the total population.

The working population is about llo.5 million, of whom 34.2 percent are in
agriculture, 21.3 percent in nining and industry, and 66.5 percent in ser-
vices and other activities relating to industry as well as in the tertiary
sector as a whole. One should also be aware that Korean emigration is signifi-
cant: 700,000 Koreans live in Japan, and 650,000 in the United 8tates--this
figure will probably exceed a million at the end of the century.

The population is relatively young: 59 percent of Koreans are mder 25. The
people are active, enterprising, and accustused to hardship. Their exception-

al dynamism is in fact the only real resource of South Korea, a preeminently
human resource.

Using 1953, the end of the war, as the zero indexuthe standard of living at
that time being comparable to that of Chad-~Korea today (1981) has a GNP
estimated at U.S. $61 billion ($1 - 710 won; Fr 1 - l20 won), or a per capital
annual income of $1,636. It was $532 in 1975, and so it has nore than tripled

it 6 years. It will probably be $1,870 at the and of 1982 ($280 in China;
$11.0 in Mali).1

In 1981, exports totaled $21 billion and inputs $26.3 billion (more than
double the trade of the_PRC).2 This compares with exports worth $6 billion
in 1975 and $1 billion in 1970. The rate of grovth of the economy was 7

percent in 1981, compared to 16.2 percent in 1976, 10.5 percent in 1977, and
11.6 percent in 1978.

Korea's main trading partners are the Wired States and Japan. In 1981, 26.5
percent of Korean exports went to the United States, and 16.6 percent to Japan.

In the same year, 26.3 percent of imports came from Japan, and 21.9 percent
from the United States.

In more general categories (1981), 31 percent of. Korean exports went to Asian

countries (of this, 16.4. percent to Japan), 28.8 percent to North America (of
which 26.5 percent went to the United States), 16.2 percent to Europe, of which
FOR OFHCIAL USE ONLY

12.8 percent went to the Community countries (1.7 percent to France), 15.3 per-
cent to the Middle East, 3.2 percent to latin America, 2.8 percent, $580 mil-
lion, to Africa, and 1.7 percent to Oceania.

In 1981 there was a significant rate of increase in exports to the Latin
American countries, +66.2 percent; to Oceania, 427.5 percent; to Africa,
+26.9 percent; to the Middle East, +26.2 percent; to North America, 422.1
percent; to Asia, +15.6 percent; and to Europe, +8.9 percent (BBC, +2.6

percent).

These exports in 1981 included: textile products, 29.5 percent, $6.186 bil-
lion; metallurgical products, 11.2 percent, $2.363 billion; electronic pro-
ducts, 10.6 percent, $2.219 billion; naval construction, 6.7 percent, $1.606
billion; various metallurgical products, including machine tools, 6.7 percent,
$981 million; chemical products, 2.9 percent, $605 million; tires, 2.2 per-
cent, $659 million; see products (fisheries), 2 percent, $628 million; and
plywood, 1.9 percent, $393 million.

There was significant progress in 1981 compared to 1980 in naval construc-
tion, +127.6 percent. Textile industry exports also increased by 23.6 percent.

One noteworthy aspect of Korean exports was the construction yards, public
works, and buildings in the Niddle Bast, Libya, and Nigeria, which in 1981
earned $3.5 billion in foreign currency.

The structure of the Korean economy is extremely concentrated, to the degree
that 61.2 percent of the exports in 1981 came from 50 major companies. The
principal exporters, in crder of importance, are: Daewoo, which exported
$1.906 billion in 1981; Hyundai, $1.722 billion; Semsung, $1.607 billion;
Kukje Corporation, $866 million; Hyosuns, $786 million; Seengyong, $758 mil-
lion; Bando Sangsa, $622 million; Sunltyong, $585 million; Tongkook, $300
million; and Hanil Synthetic, $226 million.3 -

These are what in Korea is called the General Trading Companies-wt chaebol
in Koreanugroups with diversified activities, like the Japanese zaibatsu but
with the important difference that the Korean cheebol does not include a bank
in the group. The banking system in Korea is very dependent on the state,
which virtually controls credit and exercises a strong state-control type of

role with respect to companies. The Korean economy can thus be defined as a
liberal economy closely confined by the state administration.

South Korean Presence in A rice

The following is a review of the various aspects of the South Korean presence
in the continent.

A) Political
Until 1975, South Korea's foreign polmy toward Africa was based to sane de-

gree on reaction to North Korea's initiatives. Seoul tried to counter
Pyongyang's broad efforts to penetrate the African states. Its efforts

FOIOI'I'IOALIBIWLY
consisted mainly of developing policy explanations; specifically, damn-
strating that North Korea's nonalignment was false, and affirming South

Korea's views on reunification.

The year 1975 marked a change in South Korean diplomacy toward Africa, a
policy which had previously been relatively passive. It took the form, on
the administrative level, of division of the Europe-Africa-Middle East Of-
fice of the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Seoul into three separate area res
sponsibilities, one of them being Africa, which usually is headed by a high
French-speaking official.

In addition to the political aspect already cited, there was also an in-
creased awareness of the economic factors specific to Africa: the assurance

of a supply of raw materials from a continent richly endowed with them, and
the development of exports. 'l‘hus, Seoul gradually became knowledgeable about
Africa, exploring its markets and assigning it a growing importance.

Since 1977, Korea has been engaged in a public relations campaip which has
not lagged. Korean ministers have visited Black Africa, and many prominent
Africans have been received officially and given VIP treatment in Seoul.
Prominent examples include visits by Senegalese President Senghor in my
1979, the Equatorial Guinea foreign minister in 1980, and the foreign min-
isters of Liberia, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and Niger in 1981.

Also, several Korean leaders have visited Africa. In November and December
1980, Foreign Affairs Minister Shinyong Lho was received in Gabon, Ivory
Coast, Cameroon, Senegal, Ghana, and Gambia.

In January 1981, Minister of Science and Technology Lee Chung-oh visited
Central Africa, Zaire, Equatorial Guinea, and Sierra Leone.

In April, Minister of Transportation Yoon Ja Joong was received in Liberia and
Nigeria. In by, Minister of Home Affairs Suh Chung the visited Djibouti.

In November and December, No Iae Woo, minister of state for national security
and foreign affairs, paid a visit to Nigeria and Upper Volts. In November,
Chun Myung Kae, minister of health and social affairs, went to Swaziland,
Bocswana, Lesotho, Malawi, and Kenya.

South Korea currently has 32 embassies on the African continent, 30 of which
are in Black Africa.

In North Africa: Egypt (diplomatic relations at embassy level established
in December 1981), Libya (December 1980), lbrocco (July 1962), and Tunisia
(March 1969).

In subsaharan Africa, Scuth Korea is represented in the following countries
(in alphabetical order according to the French spellingl): Botswana (April
1968), Cameroon (August 1961), Central Africa (September 1963), Comoros '
(february 1979), Ivory Coast (July 1961), Djibouti (December 1977), Ethiopia

Note:

1. There are permanent resident South Korean ambassadors only in the follow-
ing countries: Cameroon, Central Africa, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Gabon,

Ghana, Upper Volta, Liberia, huritania, Nigeria, Uganda, and Senegal.

2. Only Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Kenya, Lesotho, lilawi, Morocco, and Swazi-
land recognize only the Bewblic of Korea, having refused to accept represen-

tatives from North Korea. The latter is, however, represented in 45 other
African countries.

Only one Black African ambassador is resident in Seoul, that of Gabon. Nest

of the other African ambassadors accredited in Korea reside in Tokyo or in
Washington.

8) Technical Assistance

Korea's technical assistance to Africa is still at a modest level. It is
based on a nuaber of agreements with African states.

Technical cooperation agree-ants: Central African Republic, my 1973; Gabon.

July 1975; Djibouti, February 1979; Senegal, April 1979; Zaire, November
1981.

Economic and trade agreements: Niger, December 1969; Central African Repub-
lic, Hay 1973; Zaire, November 1973; Senegal, April 1975; Cameroon, December
1975 and August 1977; Chad, November 1977; Sierra Leone, my 1978; Upper
Volta, November 1978; Cameroon, my 1979; and Liberia, my 1981.

South Korean investments in Africa have also remained at a relatively modest
level. At the end of 1981, they totaled 0.8. $7,582,000--$6,965,000 in
Gabon, $563,000 in Nigeria, $69,000 in the Ivory Coast, and $25,000 in
Senegal.

Export credits to facilitate purchase of Korean products were larger. They
reached $165,502,000: $100,536,000 to Nigeria, $39,626,000 to Ghana,
$2,008,000 to Kenya (approved in 1979), $1,881,000 to Liberia (1981),
$767,000 to Gabon (1976), and $288,000 to Kenya (1977).

C) Grade

Korea's trade with Africa also ranks rather modestly, but: is making steady
progress.

In 1980, the total of exports to the whole continent was $772.8 million, or
4.6 percent of total South Korean exports ($17.5 billion for the same year).
In 1976, this figure had been $208 million, or 2.6 percent of total exports;

in 1977 $291 million, (2.9 percent); in 1978 $315.6 million (2.5 percent);
and in 1979 $523.9 million (3.6 percent).

Exports to the countries of Black Africa alone were $657 million (2.6 per-

cent of the total) in 1980, but $580 million (2.8 percent) in 1981, or an
increase of 26.9 percent.

South Korean imports from Africa are considerably smaller. The trade balance
favors Korea. In 1976, these imports totaled $75.9 million (0.8 percent of
total imports); in 1977, $98.5 million (0.7 percent); in 1978, $63.6 million

(0.3 percent); in 1979, $116.2 million (1 percent); and in 1980, $171.5 mil-
lion (0.8 percent).

Korea's main partners in sub-Saharan Africa in 1980 were: Nigeria receiving
$126.5 million in South Korean exports (boats, electronic equipment), but
Korea importing only $1 million (leather); Liberia, $198.5 million of exports
(boats, tires) and $69.5 million of imports; then, in order of importance:
Kenya, SDJ million in exports, $17.5 million in imports; the Ivory Coast,
$7.2 million in exports (textiles, vehicles), $2.25 million in imports

(coffee, cocoa); Ethiopia (purchase of coffee); Tanzania (purchase of copper);
Angola, Gabon, Uganda, etc.

It can be seen that Korea's trade with sub-Saharan Africa has thus far been

mainly with English-speaking countriesnparticularly Nigeria, which is the
focus of attention of Korean businessmen.

Exports of South Korean products are facilitated by the important role played
by KOTRA (Korean Trade Promotion Corporation). This public organization,

established in 1962, and analogous to the French Center for Foreign Trade, has
permanent representations throughout the world. In Africa, K0116 has offices

in Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, liarocco, Nigeria, Senegal,
Swaziland, and Zaire.

Also, KUIM organizes mnerous fairs abroad. These have included fairs in
Tripoli and Cairo in March 1976, in Casablanca in April-thy 1976, and in
Kinshasa in July 1976. There are similar activities almost annually in a

considerable amber of African capitals, including Tripoli, Nairobi, and
Dakar.

Every year tom also organizes export sales promotion events in Seoulufor
example, the Seoul Trade Show.

Finally, the following companies, General Trading Companies, are represented
and are very active in the listed countries:

«Nigeria: Daewoo, Hyundai, Bando, Samsung, Hanbaek, Haiti, and Hyosung.

«Ghana: Dongwon, Sajo (fisheries), haechang.

«Kenya: Daewoo, Sunkyung, Hyundai.
«Gabon: Ssanyong (cement plants).

«Liberia: Kembo (tires).

«Guinea: Daeho, lrlonyang (fisheries).

«Ethiopia: Daewoo.

It is worth mentioning the Korean construction companies (public works and
construction), which have achieved remarkable results in the past few years
in the Middle East ($12 billion in contracts in 1981; $3.5 billion in reentry
of foreign currency)--we mentioned this previously-and which now have estab-

lished themselves in Africa, obtaining numerous contracts, specifically in
Libya and Nigeria.

«Libya: In 1981, there were 8,000 South Koreans5 working on or for construc-

tion yards mainly of the Daewoo group.6 This figure should double during 1982
because of the nunarous i rtant contracts signed. The main ones are as fol-
lows: Brak-Shwarif road, In million; Socna-Shwarif road, $119 million;

Ghadames airport, $62.5 million; a development of 7,000 dwellings, $367

million; 2,500 schools in Tripolitania, $526.5 million; development of Ras
Lanui port, $295 million; and the hisurata steel complex, $130 million.

Contracts completed by South Korean companies in Libya total $109 million,

and those now underway $2.708 billion. Hayang Company obtained $250 million
in contracts in 1980. Its goal for 1981 is $850 million.

In Nigeria, Hayang Construction is building 2100 apartments in Sokoto and a
hotel for $168 million. It has a total of $178 million in contracts thus far.
Daewoo Company has reportedly signed a major contract worth $1.0 billion.

The South Korean construction companies are also beginning to establish them-
selves in Kenya, Sudan, and lauritania. In lhuritania, Tai Han company has

MOI-'I'ICIALUSIONLY
obtained two contracts: one for $12,135,000 for housing construction, and the
other very recently worth $3.l million.

Taehwa has contracted for $21,670,000 of work in lhlawi, and Kyungnam Company
for $10.5 million in Camroon.

However, in spite of the remarkable performance of the Korean economy over the
past 20 years, it cannot be overlooked that since 1980 it has been encounter-
ing serious difficulties whose causes are both structural and the result of
circumstances.

After the assassination of President Pak Chong-hui in October 1979, the year
1980 witnessed serious political unrest, with riots in Kwangju and the re-
pression which followed. Since then, order has been reestablished, and the
new President of the Republic, Chun Doo llwan, elected to the highest office

on 25 February 1980 and the representative of the army's aspirations, is firmly
mintaining it. It is true that 1980 was a bad year economically, with a
negative growth rate of -6.2 percent, and that 1981 did not live up to the
announced promises.

Certainly experts, at almost $21 billion, have reached a very high level, but
on the other hand the balance of payments has shown one of the largest deficits
ever recorded ($5.3 billion). The domestic market has shown a slight weaken-
ing. Thus, inflation has slowed-oone of the rare positive indicators that

one can find: at the end of the year it is expected to be l2 percent, compared
to 36-6-5 percent in 1980 and at the beginning of 1981. It is nevertheless true
that since 1980, and throughout 1981, the standard of living of salary workers
has declined. Public officials admit it. This decline in the purchasing
power of the majority of people is not likely to stimlate the domestic market
or ease the concern about an economic crisis, which is already admitted. Un-
employment, though not high, is increasing and mat be taken into consider-

ation. According to official statistics, it has risen to 5.2 percent of the
active labor force (15 million).

In sumary, the climate of confidence necessary for a recovery has not been
established. Investment is more and more limited. Investment in factories
and equipment dropped 2.6 percent following the decline of 26.6 percent in
1980. The statistics show that, in general, investment (domestic fired in-
vestment) declined by 12 percent in 1980 and 5.2 percent in l98l--or 17 per-
cent in 2 years. The difficult situation in the public works and construc-
tion sector in Korea itself illustrates these difficulties. The difficulties
have an even greater impact since large sectors of Korean industry, whose
staffs are often insufficiently trained, are using outdated technology, re-
sulting in a sometimes questionable production quality.

Sixth major companies have announced that their annual reports will reveal ser-
ious deficits. It is true that the banks have received government instruc-

tions to limit the damage by granting moratorium on payment of interest due.
Nonetheless, the financial situation of most of them points to serious cash-
tlow difficulties.

NI OFFICIAL USE ONLY
State currency reserves have decreased by 7.7 percent, and the foreign debt
has increased. An unofficial estimate puts the debt at $38 billion (57.8
percent of the GNP), which means a debt service rate of 17 percent, consider-
ably higher than official estimates, and makes unrealistic the government's
objective of bringing this rate down to ll percent before the end of the
Fifth Plan 1982-1987. The rise in the dollar and in American interest

rates has significantly increased the burden of this debt, both for the public

and private sectors, and there is no reason to expect a marked improvement in
the near future.

Thus the Korean economy, though it is not really on the brink of a general
crisis, and though it is able to point to certain strong features (public
works in foreign markets, shipyards, and electronics industry), can in fact be
seen to be in a clear recession. This was recognized by the mw deputy

prime minister for planning, Kim Joon Sung, when he said on 7 January 1982

that he "would try to bring the economy of the country out of the long tun-
nel of the recession in which it has found itself."

In reality, it is a crisis of growth. Korea, which in 25 years has passed
from the stage of poverty to become one of the developed countries, now faces
the problems which confront industrialized nations.

It is reasonable to believe that the extraordinary qualities of courage and
dynamism which the South Koreans have shown thus far will again be demon-
strated, and that the current crisis will ultimtely be overcome.

Whatever the case, Korea's development in these past two decades is an ex-
ample for all developing countries. It shows that human glalitiesuin a
country lacking natural wealth, small in area, with severe climatic conditions,
and moreover with the need to make a considerable defense effort to face the
North Korean threat (37 percent of the budget, 6 percent of the ON? goes to
the army)--can prevail over the most difficult conditions.

work, determination, a sense of nationality and the general interest, and
reSpect for the administration are the real factors in development. This is
the lesson that South Korea's recent history offers to the world.

French-South Korean Economic Cooperation Agreement

The French JOURNAL OFFICEL of 3 lhrch 1982 published the text of the 5-year
economic cooperation agreement between France and the Republic of Korea,
signed in Seoul on 4 April 1981 and effective the same date. The docunent
liSts in an appendix the sectors mist involved in economic cooperation:
agriculture, animal-raising, and agrofood industry; chemical industry; energy,
new forms of energy, and energy conservation; civil engineering; mechanical
and electrical engineering; metallurgical and steel industries; tourism,
audiovisual techniques; telecommunications; and transport.
FMNUI‘ES

The World Bank gave the figure $1,500 as the GNP per capita of South
Korea at the end of 1979. 1’0: North Korea (120,500 sq km, 18 million
people) the World Bank gave for the same year the figure $1,130 for GNP
per capita.

However, the trade balance showed a $5.3 billion deficit in 1981. This
was due to imports from Japan: $6.3 billion compared to $3 .4 billion
in exports; and to fuel imports: $6.9 billion. The "invisible" bal-
ance was also in deficit by $2 billion. By comparison, Taiwan's ex-
ports in 1981 totaled $22.6 billion, Hong Kong $21.7 billion, and
Singapore $20.9 billion.

However, Special mention should be made of smell and medium enterprises.
ahich total 27,655 out of a total of 28,809 companies in Korea. These
employ 43 percent of the work force (909,000) of Korean industrial and
consnercial enterprises. Production by small and media enterprises in
1978 totaled $12.2 billion out of $38.3 billion, or 31.9 percent of

total industrial production. In 1979, they contributed 35.l percent of
total Korean exports.

The Republic of Korea does not have diplomatic relations with South Africa.

Korean Air Lines serves Libya once a week with a Seoul-Bahrain-‘l‘ripoli
route.

The Huundai, Samsung, Heyang, and onn groups also cooperate in Libya.

[Text] The DPRK (North Korea) decided, at its Supreme People's Assembly
[SPA], on the new lineup of its governlent leaders including President
Kim Il-song who was reelected. President Kin delivered an address out-
lining the country’s internal and external policies on April 110. It is
significant to note that President Kim attached special inportance to
econosic construction, especially the achievement of the food production
target.

Kim's address is believed to have disclosed the actual conditions of

North Korea today and its future course. Attention was focused on the

SPA which strangely failed to nention Kin Chong-il, the son of Kin Il-song.
while announcing the lineup of the government leaders. Earlier, it had
been rumored that Kin Chang-11 would be elected vice president, but he

was given no government post. Moreover, the Aasenhly ended in one day.

No names were announced for the hose minister and the defense minister.

Considering the way the lineup was announced, speculation ran high that
the internal North Korean politics lust have been harassed by serious
domestic strife. President Kim. in his policy speech made at the joint
session of the WP and the SPA the seas day, declared that promotion of
socialism is iupossihle without economic construction and that the
material and technological foundations of cot—union and socialism must

he further strengthened for that purpose. he then called on the nation
to redouble its efforts to realize the production targets of fishery and
agricultural products. It was a far cry from his past speeches which gave
top priority to industry.

North Korea officially announced that the 1979 food production was 9 nillion
tons and that the 1980 production reached the level of 1979. The official
report also declared that the year 1981 was a bumper year, but failed to
announce the exact figures. Hence, it was speculated that North Korea
night have failed to realize its target in 1981 due to cold weather damage.

Against such a stringent background, the country had to export rice for the
purchase of necessary items including oil, thus wrecking the domestic food
supply system. Kin's unusual stress on stepping up agricultural production
and the abstract official state-eat on the 1981 food production suggest

that the country is in a tight fix as far as the food situation is concerned.

Great people's halls have been constructed at various places in North
Korea to celebrate the 70th birthday of Kim Il-song. The Korean president,
however, made no mention of the halls in his policy speech.

A report has it that an excessive amount of capital. materials and manpower
has been used for the construction of the memorial halls. and that this
resulted in applying additional pressure on other fields of economic
activities. The same source added that the excessive manner of constructing
such structures gave rise to great dissatisfaction among the masses. The

president's son Kim Chong-il has led the campaign to build the neaorial
halls.

A top ranking North Korean leader told Japanese reporters that Kim Chang-11
has been quite active as an assistant to the president, adding that the son
is regarded as a successor to Kim Ilosong not because he is the president's
son but because he possesses excellent leadership and personality in his
own right. The speculated shift of power, however, has caused criticism

at home and abroad as a kind of hereditary succession.

President Kim also touched in his speech on the independent and peaceful
unification of North and South Korea while, at the same time, calling for
the withdrawal of the u.s. forces stationed in South Korea. The ratio of
defense spending in the total expenditures somewhat decreased compared
with that of last year, but it is still a high 16.5 percent.

It may be important to push through mechanization of agriculture and proaote
reclamation and exploitation for increased food production, but we believe
that what is more important is the effort to ensure stability in the Korean
Peninsula. He urge North Korea to open the way for a definite North-South
dialogue.

DPKK CANCKLING INVITATIONS 1'0 JAPANBSB
M00901 ‘i'okyo NAINICNI SW in Japanese 17 May 82 sorning edition p 2

[Text] Since early Nay the am (North Korea) has one after another been
canceling its invitations to Japanese groups of various circles. Events
marking the 70th birthday of President [is Il-song were held on 15 April
and sore and sore Japanese groups were visiting North Korea than usual.
The cancelations have given rise to speculation enong those concerned

that "sonething oust be happening in Pyongyang now."

A group of the Liberal Denocrstic Party's Afro-Asian Affairs Research
Council. which was scheduled to visit Pyongyang during the series of
holidays in May. was the first to have its invitation canceled by North
Korea. 0n the eve of its scheduled departure in late April, the group,
headed by Nitsuharu Anano. was informed by the General Association of
Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon] of the North Korean Government's
wish to ”postpone the visit." The reason cited by Chongnyon was: "After
attendirg the festivities celebrating President Kin Il-song'e birthday,
may of the guests fros various countries have been staying in Pyongyang
and. therefore, it will be impossible extend a proper reception to your
I.

group .

The Afro-Asian Affairs Research Council gave up its plan to send a nission
to North Korea but citing "delegation head Anano's ill health" as the
reason. The council accepted Pyongyang's request that they do not reveal
the fact that it was North Korea which rejected the visit.

On 10 May the North Korean side notified Kono, acting head of the Nev
Liberal Club [NLC], that it was canceling its invitation to his "due to
dosestic circumstances.” Kano had planned to visit North Korea on 20 May
to keep his party's ties with the two Koreas in balance following NLC
representative Tagawa's visit to South Korea on 10 Hay.

In the nonpolitical field, a group from physical education circles scheduled
to leave for North Korea in late Nay and led by Nisata Ymguchi, director
of the athletics association. and a sission of five nayore from the
liigashikateura area in Chiba Prefecture, including the aayors of Hateudo
and Kashiva. had their invitations canceled on the eve of their departure.
In either case. the groups received cables shortly before the scheduled

departure dates saying "We cannot accept you due to circumstances.” When
they asked the officials concerned for explanations, the only reply they
got was: ”We are also declining all other proposed visits."

This flurry of moves shown by the North Korean side has given rise to the
speculation that "something unusual must be going on there." The reasons
the LDP and other related sources have given for this conclusion are as
follows:

1) A Supreme People's Assembly [SPA] session, which opened on 5 April,
closed after 1 day, which is unusual in view of the fact that usually it
lasts for 6 to 5 days;

2) At the SPA session, Secretary Kim Chong-il, President Kim Il-song's
first son and virtually the No. 2 man in North Korea, failed to get elected
to a key post in the state organization; also, the method of succession
from Kil Il-song to Kim Chang-11 was not made clear; and,

3) In the state organizational reshuffle, the names of two important
cabinet memberso-the defense and interior ministers-—were not announced
on the same day. possibly indicating that a large-scale reshuffle is in
progress in the defense and police organizations.

The Foreign Ministry, however, is skeptical of this view. It says that,

if something unusual is taking place in North Korea now, it should have
captured the attention of ordinary travelers and North Korea should have
canceled invitations not only to Japanese groups but also to other foreign
groups; but there are no indications that North Korea is doing so. It

adds that a visit by a delegation of the Japan-North Korea Trade Associa-
tion planned for 16 May for the purpose of holding business talks is likely
to be carried out as scheduled; and that the canceled invitations have been
limited to those extended to groups planning to visit North Korea for
friendship purposes.

On this basis, the Foreign Ministry says, "It is not right to take the
cancelations as an expression of displeasure at Japan's refusal to grant
an entry visa to SPA Deputy Hyon Chun-kuk in connection with the scheduled
visit to Japan by a delegation of North Korean fisheries negotiators,
which he was supposed to head."

Meanwhile, since Japan refused to grant an entry visa to “yon Chun-kuk,
North Korea has been accepting visits by a number of Japanese groups; there-
fore, the Poreign Ministry's interpretation does not fully explain the
situation.

Meanwhile. it should be noted that the cancelations came at a time when

the Japan-South Korea talks on economic cooperation involving an amount of
$6 billion are deadlocked. It is not clear whether this has something to
do with the cancelations but it appears almost certain that the North Korean
Government's action has some complicated background. Officials concerned
are likely to continue efforts for some time to resolve this puzzle.
