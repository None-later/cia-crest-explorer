[Annotation, introduction and table of contents]

[Text] The basic principles of the design, construction, maintenance and
repair of motor roads with different pavement types in the northern construc-
tion-climate zone are presented. Emphasis is placed on road susceptibility

to drifting snow and on roadbed construction on the marshlands which are so
common in the north. Some questions of surface ice formation and the measures
used to protect against surface ice are examined. The book is intended for
engineering and technical personnel involved with the design, construction,
repair and maintenance of motor roads and may be of interest to the transpor-
tation institute students.

Introduction. The expansion of mineral extraction and processing in the north—
ern regions of western and eastern Siberia and in the far north requires the
development in these regions in the next few years of large economic complexes
and the introduction into continuous operation of the Baikal-Amur railway
[BAH].

Extensive road construction in these regions will make it possible to markedly
increase the extraction of oil and gas in western Siberia and organize the

successful construction of severallarge industrial complexes.

General-use paved roads are being built along the BAH to aid in the construc-
tion of this rail line.

In the design and construction of roads in the subject regions it is necessary
to consider carefully the peculiarities of the natural and climatic conditions.

The primary natural characteristics of the severe climate regionsl include the
following: extremely varied lithological and temperature characteristics of

l. SNiP [Construction Norms and Regulations] 11-A.6-72: "Construction Climatol-
ogy and Geophysics" identifies in the Soviet Union the northernconstruction-
climate zone. including not only the regions of the north but also a large part
of the territory of eastern Siberia and the Far East. Because of the variety
of natural crnditions three subzones are identified which are further broken
down into four subregions. Highway clilate zoning, defined in accordance with
SNiP 11-D.5-72 and other normative documents and examined in detail later on
in the present volume, is used for the design of motor roads.

soil distribution; unfavorable nature of the active-layer soils from the view-
point of road construction (primarily frost-susceptible silty-sandy loams and
clayey loans with poor load-carrying ability upon thawing); the presence in
many cases of subsurface ice near the upper edge of the permafrost formation,
exposure of which leads to thermokarst phenomena in the roadbed area; exten-
sive boggy areas (marshes); large number of days with blizzards and snowstorms
(up to 12-15 days a month in the winter in the far north); considerable inten-
sity of snow migration and snowdrift blocking of the roads; presence in many
areas of surface ice formations; extensive soil heaving and the appearance of
frost heave mounds.

In the subject regions the connection between the design solutions and the
technology and organization of operations takes on particular importance.

The principles used in the design of the road structures (for example, reten-
tion of the moss and vegetative cover in the fill subgrade) must be imple-
mented by the technological schemes used, otherwise there will inevitably be
deformation and sometimes even failure of the road structures.

An important factor in rcad design is the necessity for carrying out thermo-
technical calculations of the thawing and settling processes in order to justi-
fy fill heights and the depth of replacement of unfavorable subgrade soils. In
those areas where the subsurface ice lies at a shallow depth the design must
ensure the presence above this ice of a frozen soil layer at least half a
meter deep in order to prevent thawing of the ice during operation of the road.

When designing a roadbed using local cohesive soils it is necessary to predict
any possible soil modulus of deformation (elasticity) increase and pavement
heaving in order to ensure the specified operational characteristics.

Experience in road construction shows that the specific nature of manifestation
of the natural peculiarities of the subject regions requires strict adherence
to the following basic principles of road construction: construction of the
roadbed for the most part in fills (the relative length of the cuts should not
exceed 3-4 percent), use in most cases of free-draining materials for construc-
tion of the roadbed. and giving the roadbed a form which minimizes snow drift-
ing problems; replacement of the silty ice-saturated soils with free-draining
soils when making cuts and in neutral areas; use of thermal insulating layers
in the subgrade of fills and cuts and on slopes with close-by fossil ice;
stabilization of the slopes of fills, side ditches and cuts in the case of
unfavorable properties of their constituent soils; use of measures to stabil-
ize fills on sloping ground; construction of fills from macrofragmental
materials in areas of surface ice formation; retention of the moss and vegeta-
tive cover in the subgrade cf the road structures; use of pavements for which
nonuniform heave mounds are less critical (low-type and light-duty high-type
pavements).

During the polar night the construction sites should be lighted and operation
of individual crews and small groups away from the primary operating units is
forbidden. Heated facilities for short-term personnel relaxation, for eating
and to provide assistance to accident and frostbite victims must be provided
at all the primary work sites; these facilities should be equipped at all times

FOR OFFIGAI. USE ONLY
with food supplies, warm clothing, medical supplies and hot water. Heated
tents or mobile homes on sled-type trailers can be used as warming stations.

During preparation for operations under arctic conditions the work units
operating at locations remote from the permanently occupied stations should

be provided with special clothing and footwear, mobile homes, thermos units
and heating equipment, fuel and food. The efforts of the medical personnel
are directed toward carrying out prophylactic measures to prevent frostbite
and providing medical assistance to frostbite victims. During planning and
organization of the operations we determine the work schedule and the allowable
time of personnel stay in the open air, particularly at low temperatures and
with strong winds. With account for the weather conditions we establish the
machinery productivity norms and the production capabilities of the work teams.
Vehicle drivers and the personnel of units working far from the housing facili-
ties are furnished sleeping bags. Transport vehicles should travel in convoys
whenever possible. The convoys should include repair vehicles and vehicles
with heated bodies. In the course of road construction constant communication
should be maintained with the weather service and the work crews should be pro-
vided with information on any possible weather changes. The width of timber
clearings is limited and clearing should be accomplished by sawing down the
trees without removing the stumps. When constructing roads in the southern
regions of the northern construction-climate zone the forest clearings should
be wider (preferably accomplished a year before the construction of the road-
bed). the moss and vegetative cover should be removed, the stumps pulled out,
and floorings and coverings of timbers laid down in the subgrade of fills being
erected in marsh areas. The "push away" fill principle is widely used in road-
bed construction in order to retain the moss and vegetative cover in the limits
of the roadway. Road operations are carried out on a broad front with the
objective of the fastest possible joining up of the completed segments and
protection of the subgrade soils against deep thawing. Equipment is delivered
to the work sites primarily during the winter, when the "roadability" of the
ground (particularly in the far north) is better, and also by river in the
ice-free period. In the winter the burrow pits are protected against snow and
in the spring against water from the melting snow. Winter motor roads are

used extensively for construction vehicle movement. The machines are selected
with account for the time ofyear and the natural and climatic peculiarities of
the region (machines with improved flotation are required for spring and summer
operations, vehicles with improved frost resistance of the basic components
and with heated cabs, i.e., winterized vehicles, are required for winter
operations).

All the road and bridge construction equipment should be prepared well ahead
of time for operation at low temperatures, with strong winds and in the polar
night: the cabs and the battery and engine compartments should be sealed and
heated, the vehicle fleets should be provided with devices for group preheat-
ing of the engines, and the bodies of trucks intended for personnel transpor-
tation should be heated; outside parking areas and temporary vehicle parking
areas should be protected against drifting snow. Cold-resistant rubber should
be used on the wheeled vehicles when the air temperature reaches -kO°C or
lower.

The highway scientific-research institutes and many colleges and design. con-
st ruction and operational organizations have recently done much to improve the

quality of motor road construction in these regions. Thus, on the basis of
study of the experience in pavement construction in the northern regions

there have been developed the principles followed in the specification of re-
gional pavement types. 0n the basis of correlation of the experience in com-
batting surface ice on the railroads and motor roads there have been developed
the fundamentals of surface ice formation forecasting, and the designs of the

devices used in combatting surface ice and the methods of their analysis have
been improved.

Hith account for field experience and the scientific and engineering develop-
ments of the last few years. in the corresponding divisions of this volume we
present coordinated and field-proven recouendations, supplementing and expand-
ing the normative documents relating to the survey, design and construction of
motor roads in these regions.

Foreword

Electrification of the railroads is an important element of technical progress
in transportation. It allows a significant increase in the carrying and traf-
fic capacities of the railroads. the efficiency of shipping work, and labor
productivity. It makes it possible to improve working conditions and reduce
consumption of fuel and energy resources. Electrification of trunk railroads
promotes electrification of the entire national economy because the traction
substations that feed the distribution networks are not used only for the needs
of electrical traction, but also supply electric power to industrial enterprises,
kolkhozes, and sovkhozes in nearby regions.

The rise in production of electricity in the country (see Table 1 below) and the
development of electrical grids promoted electrification of the national economy.
including railroad transportation.

Hineral'nyye Vody to Kislovodsk

The railroads switched to electric traction
were chiefly in the Urals. Of 629 kilometers
of rail lines dismantled in connection with
the temporary occupation of part of Soviet
territory, 339 kilometers were restored as the
territory was liberated from the enemy.

Restoration of rail sectors dismantled during
the war years was completed. The total length

The beginning of extensive electrification
of railroads using the single-phase current
system with a voltage of 25 RV industrial
frequency. In 1960—1961 electrification of
the 1,222 km sector from Mariinsk to Zima
using alternating current was completed.

The length of electrified railroads at the end
of 1965 reached 26,900 Ion. The most im-
portant sectors switched to electric traction
were: Shalya - Kzlngur - Perm' -

The sector from Hakushino to lsil'-|<ul' was
put into operation, templeting electrifica-
tion of the world's longest trunk line (in
1973 the line was extended to Karymskaya,
making the total length 6,300 km).

um: the launching of the sectors from Malaya
Vishera to Kalinin and Kavkazskaya to
Belorechenakaya, electrification of this trunk
line was completed (it was later extended to
Yerevan, and then on to Sevan, increasing its
total length to 3,611 kn).

With launching of the Kirov - Balezino sec-
tor, electrification of the trunk line from
Hoscow through Gor'kiy to Sverdlovsk was com-
pleted.

At the end of 1970 the length of electrified
railroads was 33,900 km. The most important
sectors switched to electric traction were the
following: Slyudnyanka —- Ulan-Ude -

The transportation energy system has developed at a fast rate along with the
transition of railroads to electric traction. Until 1950 railroads built their
own small electric power plants. In subsequent years these unprofitable power
plants would close and railroad consumers were connected in to state power systems.
Table 5 below gives figures on consumption of electricity (without electric trac-
tion) by the railroads. Electricity is transferred to nontransportation users lo-
cated in regions adjacent to the railroad through the distribution networks (see
Table 6 below) and traction substations of the Ministry of Railroads. Electricity
consumption for train traction is growing steadily. Table 7 below gives data on
this for the period between 1955 and 1979.

Many years of experience with operating electric traction have demonstrated its
great technical and economic aovantsges not only over steam traction, but also over
diesel traction.

The development of the transportation electrical power system fostered widespread
introduction of automatic blocking, centralized dispatching, electrical centraliza-
tion of switches, and automation of crossings. In addition to increasing traffic
and carrying capacity, this led to growth in labor productivity, significantly im-
proved train traffic safety, and facilitated a rise in the professional and tech-
nical level of railroad workers.

The electric traction power supply units and the transportation energy system are

an important branch of railroad transportation. The basic line of future develop-
ment for it will be raising the technical level and operating reliability by using
more sophisticated equipment and modern materials, extensive employment of various
regulating devices. introduction of automation and remote control. improvements in
protective means. development and construction of diagnostic units to monitor the

condition of structures and equipment, and raising the level of mechanization for

repair and operations work.

PLANNING, ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS IN REDUCING TRANSPORTATION COSTS
Moscow VOPROSY EKONOHIKI in Russian No 3, Mar 82 pp 42-53
[Article by A. Mitaishvili: "Transportation Costs of the National Economy"]

[Text] The document "Basic Directions of Economic and Social Development of the
USSR for 1981-1985 and the Period Until 1990" contemplates a decline in specific
transportation costs and expenditure of resources to convey freight and passengers.
Solving this problem is very important for the national economy. Transportation
costs constitute a significant part of total production and consumption costs and
are one of the significant factors affecting production efficiency.

Reducing specific transportation costs in the value of final output makes produc-
tion less dependent on sources of raw material and fuel; it allows more rational
location of production throughout the territory of the country and broader intro-
duction of progressive forms of large-scale mass production. High specific
transportation costs per unit of output retard growth in the level of specializa-
tion and cooperation, vhile by contrast when freight shipping is less expensive
there are broader opportunities for production specialization and interregional
cooperation.

K. Marx, analyzing capitalist production and circulation, observed that "transpor-
tation costs play too important a role"1 in the circulation of capital, that ab-
solute transportation costs, where other conditions are equal, increase the cost
of the commodity by an amount directly proportional to the distance that the com-
modity is moved. In this situation the relative anount of the given cost is also
directly proportional to the volume and weight of the commodity.

Under contemporary conditions reducing specific transportation expenditures is
becoming increasingly important in connection with the large scale of our economy
and the growing distances between extracting and manufacturing sectors. This is
causing a rapid rise in the volume of shipping and freight turnover, and there-
fore also in transportation costs. The freight turnover of transportation in the
USSR grew rapidly in the 1960's and 1970's. It reached 6.7 trillion ton-
kiloncters in 1980, 3.9 times the volume of freight turnover in 1960 and 1.7 times

the 1970 figure. The freight turnover of USSR transportation is 35 percent greater

‘ K. Marx and P. Engels, "Soch." [Works], Vol 2h, p 169

than the freight turnover of U. S. transportation. This can be explained by the
territorial features of the country and how production and distribution are or-
ganized.

In the 11th Five-Tear Plan the volume of shipping work by transportation will in-
crease 22 percent over 1980. reaching more than 8.2 trillion ton-kilometers in
1985. The territorial location of production and consumption has a decisive ef-
fect on the volume of freight turnover by transportation. The development and
economic circulation of natural resources. in particular fuel and energy re-
sources, in the eastern and northern regions of the country and the enlargement
of production chiefly by reconstruction and expansion of existing enterprises are
linked to an enlargement of the distribution (shipping) zone of the output pro-
duced. deepening economic ties among enterprises and regions of the country, and
growth in shipping distance. This way of increasing production leads to growth
in freight turnover and transportation cost and is economically justified if a

decline in aggregate specific expenditures for production and circulation is se-
cured.

Consideration of the transportation factor in siting. concentrating. and special-
izing production requires knowledge of actual transportation costs and mastery
of the methods of calculating them in the future. Unfortunately, we do not at
the present time have a scientifically substantiated and clearcut system of
planning and recording actual transportation costs in the national economy. De-
termination of national economic transportation costs and singling out their
role in the country's economy is made more difficult because certain methodo-
logical and organizational questions have not been solved. This is related to
the fact that the current system of managing transportation and planning and re-
cording transportation coats does not fully correspond to the economic nature of
transportation as a sector of material production. It should be noted that
economists do not disagree that freight transportation is an independent sector
of material production and continues the process of production in the sphere of
circulation and for the circulation sphere. In our opinion, however, the ques-
tions of delimiting the sphere of production and transportation as a sector of
material production need greater clarification.

Transportation costs in the broad sense are the costs of national economic sec-
tors related to moving articles both in the immediate process of production at
enterprises (from the warehouse to the shop, within and among shops. and from

the shop to the finished output warehouse) as well as among enterprises which are
spatially remote from one another. which is the circulation sphere. K. Marx
wrote that "movement of the object of labor and the means of labor and work force
necessary to do this play an important role in any production process. For ex-
ample, cotton is moved from the carding division to the spinning division and
coal is lifted up out of the mine. The same phenomenon is observed on a larger
scale when finished output is moved in the form of finished commodities from the
independent place of production to another. spatially remote place. "Following
transportation of products from the production site to another place there is
also transportation of finished products from the production sphere to the con-
sumption sphere."2

Speaking of transportation as supporting spatial links, K. Mari pointed out that
the circulation of commodities in space amounts to transporting them, and the
transportation industry which carries on this circulation is an independen sec-
tor of production. differing in that it is a continuation of the production
process in the sphere of cirCulation and for the circulation process.

The conveyance process in the circulation sphere consists of a series of oper-
ations: preparation of the freight for shipping, receiving it for shipping,
loading it into means of transportation, taking it to the main line of the com—
munications routes; movement itself. shipping along the line from the departure
point to the destination: transshipping the freight from one type of means of
transportation to another when it travels in mixed transportation involving two
or more types of transportation; unloading at the destination point; and finally.
delivering the freight to the customer's commodity warehouse. These operations
in shipping finished output are transportation operations in the circulation
sphere. Transportation costs consist of expenditures involved in the full cycle

of the process of shipping freight from the finished output warehouse of the
supplier to the customer's warehouse.

Transportation expenditures to move loads within an enterprise (industrial ship-
ping) and in the circulation sphere (that is. between manufacturing enterprises
and consumers) differ significantly in their economic nature. In the first case
they are an element of the production process of the particular enterprise and
support the production process. In this situation the enterprise's means of
transportation are a part of the industrial process of production and take part
in creating the physical product of labor. By their economic nature. therefore,
the costs of industrial transportation belong with production costs and are in-
cluded in them. But means of transportation that support the external spatial
links of the enterprise continue the process of production in the circulation
sphere and for circulation, regardless of whether they are legally independent.
The production functioning of transportation does not create physical products
of labor, although their coat goes up. Transportation costs as an independent
sector belong to circulation costs. not to production costs. In practice, how-
ever. there is no such clearcut delineation between the costs of internal trans-
portation and the costs of transportation as a sector of material production.
The transportation expenditures of the national economy are significantly under-
stated, while production costs are substantially overstated.

The present system of planning and recording transportation costs of the national
economy violates the economic principle of delimiting the sphere of immediate
production from circulation. To some extent the structure of transportation
management leads to this. In organizational terms, USSR transportation is di-
vided into general-use transportation and departmental transportation.

The functions of general-use transportation as a sector of material production
that combines the transportation ministries of the USSR into a system include

only part of the industrial process of shipping, moving freight along the main
transportation lines. The most labor-intensive initial and final operations of

shipping - loading general-purpose means of transportation. hauling freight to
the station (port) of the trunk communication line, unloading at the arrival

point. and delivery of the freight to the customer's warehouse - are related

to the circulation sphere and performed by departmental nongeneralouse industrial
transportation. Expenditures for these operations are included in production
costs, which distorts the true figure for transportation costs of the national
economy. Expenditures for these transportation operations are not planned and
are not recorded in a separate expenditure sub-heading.

It seems to us that the category transportation costs of the national economy
should include expenditures for performance of all the operations of the shipping
process. beginning with loading the means of transportation and ending with un-
loading it. This necessitates transferring what is called external industrial
transportation to the ministries in charge of general-use transportation. Pipe-
line transportation should also be included with general-use transportation serv-
ing the circulation sphere. Production enterprises and organizations must be
left the essential means of transportation to perform internal industrial ship-
ping. Expenditures involved in this kind of shipping should be included in pro-
duction expenditures.

Calculations made at the Institute of Comprehensive Transportation Problems cover-
ing all the operations of the shipping process showed that the present system of
planning and recording fails to cover about 25-30 percent of national economic
transportation costs.

The figures given in Table 1 below characterize the relationships of growth in
gross public product, freight turnover. and transportation costs calculated on

the basis of the above-mentioned principle of delimiting the spheres of production
and circulation.

Total calculated transportation costs of the national economy in 1980 were 55
billion rubles, almost four times greater than in 1960 and 1.96 times the 1970
figure. The growth rate of national economic transportation costs in the 1970
figure exceeded the growth rate of gross public product and freight turnover.

In 1980 when gross social product had increased 1.68 times over 1970 and freight
turnover 1.71 times, transportation costs were up 1.96 times. Specific trans-
portation costs per ruble of gross social product produced increased. Specific
transportation costs per ruble of gross social product were about 5.1 kopecks in
1980 compared to 4.35 in 1970. If we consider that during this time the structure
of production changed significantly with an increase in the proportion of output
with high costs, the growth and transportation expenditures per unit in physical
terms would be even higher.

There are various reasons for the faster growth of transportation costs. The
level of national economic transportation costs and their specific level depend
first of all on the location of production and consumption, on the degree of
concentration, specialization. and cooperation in production. Secondly, they de-
pend on the system of the material-technical supply and marketing and the effi-
ciency of transportation-economic links. In the third place, they depend on the
structure of the transportation system itself and the distribution of shipping
among different forms of transportation. Finally, they depend on the costs of
transportation enterprises. which determine the level of shipping rates, and
price formation policy for transportation services.

During the period under consideration there has been a significant change in the
location of production, particularly the extracting sectors, and this has in-
creased shipping distances. Host (about 90 percent) of fuel and energy resources
are concentrated in Siberia, Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the Far East, while the
fuel consuming sectors are located chiefly in the European part of the country

and the Urals. These regions have about 82 percent of the manufacturing sectors

in national production. Their needs for fuel and energy resources are supplied
by import from the éuSlulu parts of the country.

In 1980 the average economic distance of shipments for the transportation system
as a whole rose to 740 kilometers compared to 595 in 1970 and 460 in 1960. The
greatest distances in internal shipping were in pipeline and rail transportation
where the figures in 1980 were. respectively, 1,900 and 923 kilometers. If the
savings on production and distribution costs covers the increase in transporta-
tion costs, then the increase in shipping distance and the growth in transporta-
tion costs that it causes cannot be considered a negative phenomenon.

F. Engels wrote that a society which has been liberated from the bonds of capital—
ist production, "having raised a new generation of comprehensively developed
producers who understand the scientific foundations of all industrial production
and have studied a whole range of production sectors in practice from start to
finish, will create a new production force which will more than outweigh the labor

of shipping raw materials and fuel frou more remote points."3 Cutting transpor—
tation expenditures is not a goal in itself. For example, when planning the

Incotion of petroleum refineries the question reviewed was selecting the opti-
mal type of enterprise. Technicalveconomic calculations were made taking ac-
count of all elements of expenditures for Both production and sales. The optimal
variation was one with a large volume of refining where transportation costs in-
creased more than 2.5 times. In the other alternative refining capacity was
scarcely half as great, while the shipping distances for petroleum were 920 and
400 kilometers respectively. But this does not mean that we should not try to
reduce economically unsound shipping when deciding questions of production siting,
specialization. and cooperation. Establishing rational transportation-economic
ties and reducing too-long. counter, and repeated shipments in planning the pro-
duction and delivery of output is one of the important steps to reduce specific
transportation costs and expenditure of resources for shipping.

There were also changes in the very structure of transportation in the 1970's
and this influenced the level of costs. The share of railroad transportation in
total freight turnover of the transportation system dropped from 63.1 percent in
1970 to 50.7 percent in 1980, as did the shares of maritime transportation (from
16.6 to 12.3 percent) and river transportation (frOm 4.6 to 3.6 percent). The
share of pipeline and motor vehicle transportation in total freight turnover in-
creased. These changes were reflected in the level of transportation costs be-
cause each type of transportation has its own characteristic level of prime cost
of shipping and an average earning rate corresponding to it. The earning rates
in motor vehicle and air transportation are much higher than in rail, water, and
pipeline transportation. The earning rate in air transportation is stut 190
kopecks per 10 ton-kilometers and 85 kepecks in motor vehicle transportation;
for railroad transportation the figure is four kopecks, and in maritime trans-
portation it is about five kopecks. The changes that took place in the structure
of transportation, in particular the increase in the proportion of the most ex-
pensive type of transportation (motor vehicles) and a decline in the share of
the least expensive forms (rail and water) led to the faster growth of transpor-
tation costs. It should be noted here that motor vehicle transportation ac-
counted for about 45 percent of transportation costs in 1980 while its share of
total freight turnover was about seven percent; the corresponding figures for
the share of the railroads were 36 and 50 percent.

Optimizing the structure of the country's transportation system and rational dis-
tribution of freight shipments among different types of transportation are im-
portsnt reserves for reducing transportation costs in the national economy. Ac-
celerated development of pipeline transportation for pumping petroleum products
is very important. At the present time. however. the bulk of shipments of
petroleum products continue to go by rail transportation, even though pumping
petroleum through pipelines is much cheaper. Water transportation must also be
used intensively for shipping bulk cargo. The use of motor vehicle freight trans-
portation should be limited primarily to shipping within regions and cities.
Moreover, new forms of transportation such as pneumatic cantainer, pulp-pipeline,
and conveyor transportation should be used extensively for such shipments in
place of labor-intensive and fuelcintensive motor vehicle transportation. Motor
vehicle transportation should be consolidated (above all in the cities) in uni-
ficd general-use vehicle transportation enterprises.

A: the present time 85 percent of the total truck fleet in the country is de-
partmental transportation (industry, construction, and agriculture). Industrial,
construction, and agricultural enterprises and organizations use a significant
share of the vehicles belonging to them for intercity shipping. In 1980 the
total freight turnover of motor vehicle transportation in the national economy
was 632 billion ton-kilometers, which included 100 billion ton-kilometers for
intercity shipping (with a prime cost of shipping of 60 kopecks per 10 ton-
kilometers). The prime cost of intercity shipping in general-use vehicle trans-
portation is about 38 kopecks for 10 ton-kilometers, which is 36 percent lower
than the prime cost of such shipment by departmental transportation. If all
intercity (that is, non-production) shipping done in 1980 by departmental vehicle
transportation had been done by general-use vehicle transportation enterprises
the national economy would have saved about 2.5 billion rubles.

The comparatively high level of transportation costs in the national economy is
also linked, in addition to growth in shipping distance, to the structure of
means of production consumed, material-intensiveness, and the quality of prepar-
ation for shipping. In 1980 transportation costs represented the following per-
centages of the cost of output in the extracting sectors: mineral building
materials - 39.6 percent; products of petroleum extraction —- 29.6 percent;
logging products - 23.0 percent; ferrous metal ores and nonore raw material -
20.0; coal —- 18.1 percent; products of the mining chemical industry - 17.2
percent; peat - 15 percent.

Transportation-intensive physical raw materials predominate in the composition

of consumable means of production; they account for more than 70 percent of the
total volume of natural resources put into production circulation. This is re-
lated not only to the growth in industrial refining of mineral products, but
chiefly to the worsening quality of raw material being extracted. In 1980 ferrous
metallurgy plants‘received 34 percent of commodity output from an extraction
figure of about 500 million tons of raw iron ore, whereas in 1965 the figure was
40.8 percent. The iron content in commodity ore presented to transportation for
shipping was 58.5 percent after enrichment. In 1980 2‘ percent of the coal mined
at underground mines was worthless rock compared to 21 percent in 1965. The level
of concentration of coal extracted in 1980 did not exceed 55 percent. Shipment of
round timber over long distances from the North and East to the European part of
the country for milling increases the volume of transportation work by 30-35 per-
cent in comparison with shipping crosscut wood. A significant part of mineral
building materials are not dressed in advance at the extraction point. This
process has been transferred to the places where they are put to production use,
and as a result the volume of transportation work and transportation costs in-
creased more than 9-10 percent.

Shipment of raw material without preliminary processing requires additional means
of transportation: railroad cars, ships, and motor vehicles. The rolling stock
requirement of the railroads for shipping unprepared coal and ore increases 35-
40 percent, while for round timber (instead of sawtimber) it is 30-35 percent
higher. for unstacked scrap metal it is almost three times as high, and for
simple superphosphate it more than doubles. This leads to an increase in both
current operating costs of transportation and capital investment.

The material-intensity of production also influences the level of transporta-
tion costs; In recent years our country has stepped up the campaign for
economical use of fuel-energy resources, metal, building materials. lumber, and
products of the chemical industry. But expenditure of the principal types of
primary materials and fuel in the USSR is still much higher than in the indus-
trially developed capitalist countries. Calculations show that reducing the
material-intensiveness of production and construction in our country to the level
achieved by industrially developed foreign countries would have enabled us to
reduce the volume of transportation work and transportation costs in 1980 by
about 18-20 percent. Thus, improving the quality of materials and fuel being
shipped by preparing then and reducing the material-intensiveness of production
is an important way to reduce the transportationcostsof the national economy.

Planning shipping and economic links and eliminating irrational shipping has a
special role to play in reducing transportation costs. The questions of improv-
ing the planning of freight shipment must be resolved not as intrasectorial
transportation problems. but as parts of the overall national economic problem.
In this case planning national economic needs for shipping must be based on
material-technical supply plans and delivery plans worked out by the appropri-
ate agencies. In turn. material-technical supply agencies should have terri-
torial balances of production and consumption whose development was contemplated
by the July 1979 decree of the CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of
Ministers on improving the economic mechanism. But these balances are not being
produced yet. Development of territorial balances of production and consumption
is necessary not only to insure integrated development of transportation, but also
for rational siting of productive forces in the country. The need for freight
shipping should not be determined on the basis of the requests from freight ship-
ping ministries and departments, as is the case today, but rather on the basis

of a plan that assigns suppliers to customers. The time has come to assign
material-technical supply and marketing agencies to present transportation
ministries and their local organizations with freight shipping demands indi-
cating the loading point (shipping station or port) and unloading point (destina-
tion station or port) with a distribution of shipments by shippers and receivers.
0n the basis of these papers the transportation ministries must compile plans

for the freight to travel from the supplier to the consumer directly or in

mixed transportation involving two or several types of transportation. The
choice of the shipping plan should be based on minimum social transportation
expenditures. Material-technical supply and marketing agencies must be ma-
terially accountable to transportation for performance of shipping demands, just
as transportation must be responsible for delivery of freight at a certain time
in the required volume.

Economic links for delivery of output are established by material-technical
Supply agencies. and transportation carries out delivery plans and carries
freight to the consumers according to their schedule-orders. Therefore. ship-
ping costs should be normed and planned by material-technical supply agencies,
not by freight shippers or receivers. With the current system of {ranking (pre-
payment) of prices the freight receiver cannot influence the choice of supplier
enterprise, type of transportation. and route of travel of the freight because
this is the function of material-technical supply and marketing agencies. The
freight receiver pays the actual transportation costs. whose level is determined

32

depending on prepayment of prices by the freight shipper or by material-
technical supply and marketing agencies. But material—technical supply agencies
and freight shippers do not have an economic interest in cutting transportation
costs because expenditures for shipping are fully repaid by the receiver of the
shipment.

At the present time ministries do not plan and record transportation costs of
production associations and organizations as an independent indicator. Under the
current system of costing industrial output transportation expenditures for de-
livery of material resources are included in the cost of the raw and processed
materials and fuel being purchased. while expenditures incident to the sale of
the finished output are recorded in general marketing expenditures. This kind of
planning and accounting makes it more difficult to monitor the use of resources
for freight shipment and diminishes the possibility of analyzing, identifying, and
using existing reserves to cut transportation costs. The present system does not
allow us to determine the true magnitude and dynamics of aggregate transporta-
tion costs of the national economy.

In our opinion. it would be wise to single out transportation costs as an inde-
pendent expenditure subheading in planning. accounting for. and reporting circu-
lation costs. Norms should be established for them by production sectors.
Appropriate changes must also be made in existing methodological instructions and
basic statutes on planning and recording the prime coat of output. The methodo-
logical instructions must envision differentiation of transportation costs ac-
cording to a number of characteristics. above all the economic characteristic.
Material resources that are brought to the enterprise and sale of finished output
(including all elements of expenditures related to delivering the freight from
the supplier's warehouse to the consumer and with loading-unloading work) must

be classified as circulation costs. In this case expenditures for internal in-

dustrial shipping should be put in a special sub-heading and related to produc-
tion expenditures.

The level of national economic transportation expenditures is directly dependent
on expenditure of material resources for shipping freight. In 1980 expenditures
of material resources in general-use transportation were 55.2 percent of the
prime cost of shipping freight (including depreciation deductions) in rail trans-
portation, 84 percent in maritime, 62.3 percent in river, 69 percent in motor
vehicle. and 80.9 percent in petroleum pipeline transportation. In view of the
high proportion of resource expenditures for shipping freight, transportation
management bodies face the problem of searching for ways and means of reducing
expenditures of material resources as much as possible. This was contemplated
by the 1980 decree of the CPSU Central Committee and USSR Cauncil of Ministers
entitled "Intensification of Hork on Economic and Rational Use of Raw Material.
Fuel-Energy. and Other Material Resources." This is even more essential because
during the 10th Five-Year Plan the specific proportions of material expenditures
in the prime cost of freight shipping grew.

The increase in expenditure of resources for shipping results above all from
shortcomings in the work of transportation. 0n the railroads this is seen in
poor organization of the shipping process. relaxation of production and labor
discipline, poor monitoring of adherence to train traffic schedules, and the

imprecise work of all elements of the railroad system. All these things have
led to a significant decline in the principal indicators of use of rolling stock.

In 1980 the technical and sector speed of freight trains declined compared to
the level attained in 1970, the daily run of freight cars decreased, and down-
time increased. As a result, the turnaround time for a freight car increased

22 percent in the same 10 years. This is equivalent to a decrease of 725
billion ton-kilometers in the carrying capacity of the railroads. which is 21 per-
cent of the volume of freight turnover performed in 1980. The freight capacity
of the rolling stock is not being fully used either. According to figures from
the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Railroad Transportation, one-
quarter of the cars were underloaded by an average of two tons. The degree of
loading of rolling stock is an indicator of its use and influences the level of
expenditures that make up both the prime cost of shipping and national economic
transportation costs. Raising the use coefficient of the freight capacity of
rolling stock reduces transportation costs. Under the existing car tariff
system when loading is increased the tariff payment per ton of freight decreases.
Underloading of rolling stock accounts for about 200 million rubles of addi-
tional national economic transportation costs a year.

The indicators of use of the resources of maritime and river transportation have
also declined. Productivity per ton of load capacity per day of operation in
ton-miles in 1980 was 24 percent lower than in 1970. This is related to an in-
crease in unproductive downtime in ports, a decrease in ship sailing speeds,

and incomplete use of their load capacities. The situation is similar in river
and motor vehicle transportation. The productivity of traction vessels in river
transportation declined by 24.6 percent between 1970 and 1980. while for trucks
(per average vehicle) the figure was 7.3 percent. All these things had a nega-
tive effect on the indicator of efficiency of use of fixed production capital,
above all rolling stock. As Table 2 below shows, during the Tenth Five-Year
Plan the output-capital ratio compared to the Ninth Five-Year Plan declined for
all forms of transportation except pipelines.

As the figures in the table show, water transportation has the highest output-
capital ratio. This indicator for motor vehicle transportation is about one-
third of the average value for the transportation system as a whole. The

figures in Table 2 illustrate that the output-capital ratio rose for all forms
of transportation except water transportation in the Ninth Pive-Iear Plan. In
the Tenth Five-Year Plan the output-capital ratio dropped appreciably in rail
and water transportation. In motor vehicle and pipeline transportation in 1980
this indicator remained at about the 1975 level. In connection with structural
changes in the transportation system as a whole for freight shipping, the output-
capital ratio declined 12.6 percent in the Tenth Five-Year Plan. The worsening
technical condition of rolling stock and the fleet has a significant impact on
the decline in output-capital ratio. During the Tenth Five-Year Plan the value
of the inoperable fleet in railroad transportation increased 1.8 times, while in
river transportation it increased 1.6 times. The worsening of these indicators
is also linked to disproportions that have taken shape in the development of the
material—technical base of transportation. The essential reinforcement of the
capacities of the existing railroad system, which was working at great intensity,
was not accomplished. During this time the introduction of double-track and
electrified lines decreased. The use of means of transportation is also being
held back by inadequate development of the network of railroad stations, maritime
and river ports, vehicle roads, and the repair base.

The significant growth in the cost of transportati J facilities being built in
the northern and eastern regions of the country, the rise in the capital-
intensiveness of structures, and the increasingly rigid social and ecological
requirements also have a significant influence on the output-capital ratio.

In the Tenth Five-Year Plan capital investment per kilometer of new railroad line,
second tracks, vehicle roads, and for construction of maritime and river ports
and trunk pipelines was 1.3-1.6 times more than similar costs in the Ninth Five—
Year Plan.

In 1980 the cost of fixed productive capital (without rolling stock) per kilom-
eter of length of the railroads increased 11.2 percent over 1975, while the
specific cost of hard-surface vehicle roads rose 16 percent.

Important steps to reduce transportation costs are working out measures to im—
prove the system of the shipping process and making better use of the fixed
productive capital of transportation together with raising the efficiency of uSc
of all its resources.

Economical use of fuel and energy resources is a critical issue. Transportation
is a major consumer of these resources, accounting for about 10 percent of total
consumption ofenergyresources in the country. Technical re-equipping of trans-
portation, replacement of steam traction with diesel traction on railroads and
in water transportation. and the development of motor vehicle transportation led
to a sharp increase in the use of light petroleum products, from 35 million to
130 million tons or more than 3.7 times between 1960 and 1980. In the postwar
fivewyear plans transportation has attained relatively high efficiency of fuel
use. The specific expenditure of standard fuel in USSR railroad transportation
is considerably lower than in the United States, Heat Germany, France, and other
industrially developed countries. In 1980 this figure for USSR railroads was
8.55 kilograms of standard fuel per thousand gross ton-kilometers. compared to
11.5 in the United States and 15.1 in West Germany.

The shortcomings noted above in use of rolling stock caused a certain decline in
the indicators of fuel use in the 10th Five-Year Plan compared to the Ninth Five-
Year Plan. On the country's railroads the specific expenditure of ener re-
sources for electric traction increased from 124.0 kilowatt-hours per.10 gross
ton—kilometers in 1970 to 127.2 in 1980; the corresponding figures for diesel
traction were 68.6 kilograms of standard fuel per 10“ gross ton-kilometers in
1970 to 53 in 1980. For shipment by diesel freighters in river transportation
the specific norm of expenditures of standard fuel rose from 9.8 kilograms in
1973 to 12.5 kilograms in 1980. Refining the operations systems and improving
the indicators of use of rolling stock by reducing downtime are major reserves
for lowering actual specific expenditures of fuel-energy resources by transpor-
tation. The use of diesel-powered motor vehicles is a major reserve for lowering
consumption of petroleum products. Diesels with efficiency rates that reach

38 percent consume 35-60 percent less fuel than standard engines. Calculations
show that gasoline consumption could be reduced to approximately 30 million tons
by full use of diesel motor vehicle transportation.“ Reducing consumption of
liquid fuel and preservation of the ecological balance demand that we step up
work on the development of electric vehicles and switch to the use of liquefied
gas. A number of industrially developed capitalist countries are planning to
move from experimental production to large-series production of electric vehicles
for passengers and freight shipping.

Improving the technical condition of highways is a significant factor in cutting
fuel consumption. At the end of 1980 only 37 percent of the total system of

1,360,000 kilometers of motor vehicle roads had improved surfaces; this was
510,000 kilometers. The low technical level of the roads causes an increase

in fuel expenditures and in specific transportation costs of the national
economy. shipping on highways with asphalt and concrete surfaces reqnires 20-30
percent less fuel than shipping on unimproved roads. The prime cost of freight
shipping on roads with asphalt and concrete surfaces is just two—fifths of the
figure for roads with rock surfaces, and expenditures for road repair and main-
tenance are barely one-sixth as much.

National economic transportation costs are high because of losses and spoilage of
freight during the transportation process. This figure reaches an impressive
size. For example, coal losses are almost three percent (equivalent to losses of
2 million tons of coal). while for glass it is 10 percent (23 million square
meters of glass), for bricks 13 percent (more than 2.7 billion bricks), for ore
up to four percent (15—16 million tons of ferrous and nonferrous metal). and so
on. Because delivery time of freight to customers increased in 1980, there was

a rise in frozen material resources. The rise in national economic costs for
this reason is more than a billion rubles. Unrecorded transportation costs re-
sulting from losses and spoilage of freight in the transportation process and

the lowered delivery speed run into billions of rubles. But plans do not en-
vision indicators of the quality of shipping and transportation work and no such
indicators are considered in evaluating the activities of transportation enter-

prises.
Solving a number of methodological and organizational questions for improving
transportation cost planning and accounting and achieving savings of material

resource expenditures for freight shipment by transportation are very important
to reduce specific transportation costs of the national economy.
