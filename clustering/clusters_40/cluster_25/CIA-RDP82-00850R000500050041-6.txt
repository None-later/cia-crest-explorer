USE OF DIRIGIBLES FOR CONSTRUCTION, TRANSPORT “ORR
Moscow PROMYSHLBNNY TRANSPORT in Russian No 12, 81 pp 19-20

[Article by B. G. Broude, candidate of technical sciences: "Installation and
Transport balloons"]

[Text] The journal PROHYSHLENNY TRANSPORT in issue No 7
for 1978 and No 3 for 1979 carried selections of materials
on dirigibles and balloons and the general process for us-
ing them. The author of the article below considers the
possibilities of using these aircraft for installation and
transportation work in industrial construction.

Attempts have been made in recent years in our country and abroad to build
aeronautical craft for special construction—installstion and hoisting-
transportation jobs. For example, the Moscow Tsentrotekhmontazh [Central
Technical Installation] Trust has built and tested two types of aerostat-cranes
with low load capacities: the spherical EPAK-l and the Lentil-shaped EMA-10
(see the journal IZOBRETATEL'I RATSIONALIZATOR, Nos 3 and 12 for 1977). Unfor—
tunately, this project was just an attempt by amateurs, with practically no
sound scientific and production-technical base, to prove the wisdom of build-
ing and employing a new. promising means of installation.

When the wind comes up captive (tethered) balloons, which the EPAK-l was,
return to the ground and are pressed against it. Therefore, efforts have been
made for a long time to give the ship a streamlined form and provide it with
tail stabilizers which are inflated by the winds. These aerostats are always
set up downwind and receive additional aerodynamic lift (the so-called "kite
effect").

The lentil-shaped EMA-10 flying crane copied the shape of an aeroatat on which
the English and French have worked in the past and are working today. But
during horizontal movement and in strong winds these "flying saucers" proved
unstable. To keep the EMA-10 crane in a stable horizontal position. therefore,
it had to be equipped with two engine-propeller units and complex automatic
controls. The results of full-scale testing of models of these cranes showed
that they are inferior to helicopters with respect to maneuverability and
precision of setting down cargoes.

The Leningrad Orgtekhstroy [Organization of Technical Contraction] Trust de-
veloped a captive aerostst-crane that we believe is more successful. They
designed a kite-type craft. The loaded aerostat was moved by means of three
winches installed at angles of 120 degrees relative to the center of the area.
The aerostat was to be raised and lowered by operating the winches simultane.
ously. To move the load on the horizontal it was necessary for the winches to
operate at different, in speed, but coordinated rpm's.

Orgtekhstroy retained the author of this article, from the Leningrad Academy of
Civil Aviation. to conduct aerodynamic experiments with models of these aero-
atat-cranes. we investigated the airflow of the aerostat crane in the proximity
of construction projects. The experiments enabled us to determine the aero-
dynamic characteristics of the aerostat, select its optimal shape, and design
the tethering line system. He established that the aerostat is most stable
when it is in front of a small object and behind a long object that shields it
from the wind. Unfortunately, this project was not completed either.

A captive aerostet can also be used successfully to transport cargo, for ex-
anple to lift mineral products at an open-cut mine and load them into railroad
cars, as was shown in Yu. S. Boyko's article "Freight Aerostats for Open-Cut
Mines" (PROHYSIEENNY TRANSPORT. No 10, 1980).

It is wise to use electrical winches, light, moderate, strong cables, and auto-
matic devices to control the aerostat-crane. The automatic devices greatly
simplify operation of the crane and enable it to put the load down more pre-
cisely.

The aerostat-crane only moves freight around within a construction site. The
freight is delivered to the site by motor vehicle, air. or rail transportation.
With a fairly ssall volume of freight of normal dimensions its delivery causes
no special problems. The problem arises with transporting heavy and large-
dimensioned articles such as hydroturhine rotors. turbogeneratore, nuclear resc-
tors, and the like. The problem is especially critical in the Par North,
Siberia. and the Far East. Airplanes are unsuitable there because of their in-

adequate load capacity and the necessity of building runways. Helicopters do
not need runways, but their load capacities are not more than 20 tons, while
their flight range without refueling is 200-250 kilometers.

Under these conditions, the use of dirigibles to transport large-dimension and
heavy articles is very promising. Their load capacity can reach 300 tons and
more, and they can also be designed and adapted as aeronautical cranes. In our
opinion, the dirigible-crane could be a transportation-installation craft which
would enable us not only to transport equipment ”from door to door," that is
without any transshippmg, but also to install it right at the point of opera-

tions .

This should be a dirigible with large load capacity for carrying freight in the
cabin and on external suspension. To use the dirigible as a crane it must have
good maneuverability when flying at low speed and "hovering" in one place.
These qualities can be created by automatic control systems that change the
vector of thrust of the propeller-engine group.

The wind forces a spherical ﬂoored kite aerostat
captive acrostat to the
ground.

When unloading unitary freight the dirigible—crane must be balanced without re-
leasing lifting gas. There are several possibilities to achieve this: secur-
ing it to the grOund; suspending a new weight or taking on ballast; and,
various ways of controlling aerostatic lift.

The principal difficulty in building a largevcapacity dirigible—crane is its
enormous dimensions. To carry a load weighing, for example, 500 tons will re—
quire a dirigible with a volume of more than 1 million cubic meters, which

may be 300-400 meters long. Sea—going vessels of this length are built. so
there is reason to hope that with contemporary scientific and technical ad—
vances industry will also be able to build giant aeronautical vessels.

Many designs of combined aircraft which use aerostatic and aerodynamic lift
have been devised to reduce the dimensions of these ships and increase their
flying speed. Among them are “helistats” (dirigible—helicopters), airplane-
dirigibles. flying wing-dirigibles. and so on.

Only "helistats," which are capable of hovering like a helicopter, can be used
as transportation—installation equipment. But operating them will be much
unre expensive than a dirigible—crane because of their very large power plants,
high fuel consumption, and complexity of design.

Most of the combined aircraft are unsuitable for use as cranes because they can-
not "hovel" in the air and require runways.

In conclusion, we should state that transportation—installation aerostats with
large load capacities can only be built on a contemporary scientific-
technical level at a specialized science—production enterprise. The statement
by doctor of technical sciences O. A. Chembrovskiy in the interview published
in issue No 10 of PROMYSHLENNY TRANSPORT for 1981 is very instructive. He

said that the most valuable feature of aerostats is their ability to perform
both transportation and loading-unloading jobs. This feature makes it possible

to organize the transportation of, for example, heavy and large-dimension
freight directly from the assembly site at the manufacturing plant to its
destination at the planned point in the installation section of the enterprise

under construction. It is noteworthy that the Energoaerotrana [Energy Aerial
Transportation] Trust headed by 0. A. Chembrovsldy has begun building proto-

types of such ships.

[Article by V. N. Ivanov and V. I. Yerokhov: "Gas Fuel for Automobile Bngines"]

[Text] Given the present scope of increasing automobile use. providing motor trans-
port with efficient, stable energy carriers is one of the most important national
economic problems. As majority of the specialists consider the nearest feasible al-
ternative to reducing the consumption of liquid petroleum~origin fuel to be the
changeover of a certain portion of the motor vehicle fleet to using gaseous fuel
such as compressed petroleum gas (SNG) or natural gas (PC). At present. preference
is being given to SNG. on which about 15.000 automobiles are running in our country.

With a view towards broadening the products list of fuel-energy resources for auto-
motive transport and saving liquid petroleum products, the extensive use of com-
pressed PG as a fuel has been examined and the basic directions and stages of ex-
perimentel design work and organizational-technical measures to develop designs for
and efficiently operate bottle-gas vehicles havebeendetermined. An experimental-
industrial lot of ZIL and GAZ (two different compression modifications) vehicles was
manufactured in 1981 and extensive operational tests were begun in L'vov and Berdi-
show. In subsequent years. we plan the following production of bottle-gas vehicles:
1982 —- 5.000. 1983 -~ 10,000. 1986 -— 35.000. 1985 -n 50,000 and beginning in 1986
- 100.000 annually. Twenty-five gas filling stations for compressed PC are to be
put into operation, including one in Moscow. two in Leningrad. three in Donetsk. two
in Tashkent, one in Noril'sk, and so forth.

As compared with the traditional liquid petroleum-origin fuels. gas fuels have a
number of indisputable advantages. The NIIAT [Scientific Research Institute of Auto-
motive franspsrt] has accumulated posltive experience in operating vehicles on SNG
and P6. The purpose of this work is to generalize available experience and deter-
mine prospects for using gas fuel in motor transport. In order to do this, we need
to study the influence of the physical-chemical properties of gas fuels on the basic
technical-operating qualities of automotive engines. to analyze the trends in using
SNG and PC as a motor fuel. and to work out the technical-operating specifications
for improving the motor properties of gas fuel.

The main SNG component: are propane. which ensures optimum saturated vapor pressure
in the gas mixture. and butane. the most easily-compressed component. The main pro-
perties of SNG as a motor fuel include pressure of the saturated vapors. density.
specific heat of combustion and octane nunber (00h). SNG saturated vapor pressure

varies from 0.27 MPa (at -10°c) to 1.6 HPa (at 45‘c). SNG has a high volumetric ex~
pansion coefficient. so the pressure in the gas cylinder increases by 0.6 to 0.7 HPa
with every 1° rise in temperature. In order to prevent destruction of the gas cyl-
inder. it will have a steam blanket of at least 10 percent of the usable capacity.
At 0°C and 101.3 kPa pressure, the density of the quuid-phase 8N0 is 530-690 kg/m’.
of the steam phase -- 1.96 (propane) to 2.6 (butane) kg/m .

The octane number of the gas fuel is 90-110. permitting forcing automobile engines to
compression ratios of 10:! to ll:l. From the viewpoint of working fluid, gas fuel
has a more favorable C :H ratio than gasoline. The carbon number -- ratio of carbon
to hydrogen (C: H) -- of modern gasolines is about 6, and the numbers for SNG and PC
are 4.9 and 2.96. respectively. The higher hydrogen content of the gas fuel also
ensure more complete combustion of the fuel in the engine cylinders.

If the gas is used to power carburetor engines. the complex of carburetion processes
no longer includes fuel vaporization in the intake pipe. with all the associated
shortcomings, so the evenness of fuel distribution among the cylinders is improved.
Maximum fuel distribution unevenness among the cylinders of a carburetor engine (35
percent or more) results in a higher carbon monoxide content (45-55 percent higher)
in exhaust gases (06), as well as a 35-45 percent higher hydrocarbon (CR) content.
given a fuel mixture stoichiometric content of a-l. Use of a gas fuel ensures a re-
duction of up to 20 percent in the maximum unevenness of fuel mixture distribution.

The combustion range of gas fuel is broader than for gasoline. permitting a more ef~
ficient depletion of the fuel mixture (up to o-l.2- 1.3) under basic operating condi-
tions. The use of SEC and PC as motor fuels therefore ensures a substantial reduc-
tion in 06 toxicity in terms of basic monitored parameters: CO content (two- to
three-fold). N0x (1.2- to two-fold) and CE (1.1- to 1.4-fold). which meets the strict
requirements of a majority of national standards. Comparison testing of ZlL-l30 and
ZIL-138 vehicles has shown that CO and OG content are 0.8-3.5 and 0.1-0.8 percent. re-
spectively. throughout the range of steady speeds of movement (20-80 km/hr). This
testifies to the real advantages of SNG and PC.

To accumulate the needed fuel reserve in the vehicle. PC is compressed to high pres-
sure (20 MPa). A cryogenic PC storage technology in the vehicle is considered more
promising and is viewed as an intermediate stage in the development of hydrogen en-
gines, for which the reserves of working fluid in nature are practically unlimited.

The operation of a gas engine is the same as that of a gasoline engine. Gasoline.
SNC and PG differ in components and densities, but are practically identical in en-
ergy content. Operating indicators of the ZIL-l30 using different types of fuel are
given in the table [following page]. As follows from the table. given the same com-
pression ratio. maximum power is decreased by 5-7 percent when a gasoline engine is
converted to SNC, which is associated with a slower speed of spread of the ignition
front in the combustion chamber and leads to a reduction in the maximum pressure and
temperature of the operating cycle. Moreover. for a number of reasons. the fill co-
efficient is 8-10 percent lower in a gas engine than in a gasoline engine. Thanks
to the high OCh of gas fuels. the compression ratio in gas engines is 23-25 percent
higher than in gasoline engines. The high anti-knock stability of gas fuels and their
good miscibility with air permits forcing gas engines to higher compression ratios:
for example. the ZIL-l30 can be forced from 6.5 to 8 and the ZH2-53 -- from 6.7 to
8.5.

When operating on gas. a higher coefficent of excess air corresponds to the optimum
fuel expenditure. As the fuel mixture is depleted, the speed of combustion drops.
To compensate for this drop. an earlier spark advance angle is set: 4.5° and 6.5’.

respectively. for vehicles in the ZIL and GAZ families operating on SNG and 5-7' for
vehicles operating on PC.

when operating at economical vehicle speeds. a bottle-gas vehicle using 3N6 uses
12-14 percent less fuel than a ZlL-l30 with a gasoline engine. Specific fuel expen—
diture by GA2-53-07 bottle-gas vehicles is less than by base models with gasoline
engines: 4.6 percent less on asphalt-concrete paved highways and 9.5 percent less
under city driving conditions.

Switching to a carburetor engine using SNG, given an optimum compression ratio. gen-
erally leads to a 5-6 percent reduction in specific fuel expenditure (overall per-
formance). Depending on the engine operating conditions. noise reduction using SNG
reaches 7-8 dB. Motor capacity in gas engines operating on SNG and P6 is 30-35 per-
cent greater than in gasoline engines.

We have described the schematic diagram. design features and technical specifications
of a bottle-gas installation for the ZIL and GAZ vehicles operating on compressed PC
in work [I]. The level of standardization of bottle- 3 vehicles operating on She
and P6 is quite high: 75 percent for the gas equipmeg: and 95 percent for the engine.

when evaluating the possible scope of SNG use as a motor fuel. consideration must be
given to the fact that propane~butane mixtures are being used successfully for muni-
cipal- and personal-services purposes. as a raw material for chemical industry, in
industrial installations and in agriculture. Current strategy for developing a

fleet of bottle—gas vehicles must be based on a precise forecast of SEC production
and the production limit to meet motor transport needs. In this situation. we also
need to take into account the constantly changing energy policies of the world market.

In countries with their own petroleum reserves and a developed petroleum extraction
and oil refining industry. the commercial by-product gas output is entirely adequate
to meet practically all their needs. including a fleet of bottle-gas vehicles. In
spite of its adequate raw material resources. our country's SNC production is rela-
tively limited. The USSR Ministry of Petrochemical Industry's proportion of SNG

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

production is 62.9 percent, Ministry of Petroleum Industry -- 36.5 percent. and Hin-
istry of Gas Industry —- 2.6 percent. The effectiveness of continued SNG production
development is linked in considerable measures with the creation of new capacities.

At present, SNC is used 30 times more often to provide gas to population centers than
is supply-line PG, including 1.3-fold more often in small cities. 5-fold in worker
settlements and 60-fold in rural centers. In view of the fact that 8N6 is a valu-
able, high-quality motor fuel which is superior to traditional fuel of petroleum
origin in some parameters and also with consideration of the strained situation
which has developed concerning fuel for motor transport, we need to determine an
efficient sphere of 3N6 use.

The development of bottle-gas vehicles is being delayed by the lack of stable SNG de-
liveries in the quantities and quality required to meet the needs of motor transport.
Our country does not yet have a COST [All-Union State Standard] for automotive-grade
SNG. Automotive transport is using municipal-services gas. whose main parameters are
regulated by COST 20548-75. The SNG being used is not of stable composition in terms
of components or amount of undesirable impurities. leading to failure to ensure nor-
mal engine operation, and the content of hazardous substances in 00 is significantly
higher than it might be. One very frequently encounters in the domestic and foreign
literature conflicting information on the emissions and fuel economy of bottle-gas
vehicles.

The gas fuel being supplied motor transport has a high oil content. which negatively
affects the reliability of operation of the gas apparatus and the stability of gas
reducer adjustments. This is associated with the use of compressors with bushings
lubricated by motor oil to transport the SNG from the manufacturing plant to the con-
sumer and with inefficient oil sump operation. Use of compressors with graphite
bearing lubrication would be best.

In order to guarantee the operating features of bottle—gas vehicles, the USSR Minis-
try of Petrochemical Industry has worked out TU 38 001302-78 for the hydrocarbon com-
pressed fuel gases for them. These gases are 8025 percent propane. a scarce compo-
nent of SNG. However. the TU does not anticipate seasonal variations in SNG, which
has led to strain in the supply of SNG to motor transport and to violations of nor-
mative documents when operating the vehicles.

In the near future. is will be most appropriate to use PC, which does not require
complicated technological processing. According to UNESCO data published in 1974.
world PC reserves are 49.9 trillion cubic meters. According to expert estimates,
about 40 percent of the world PC reserves are in the USSR. The basic consumers of
PC in the 10th Five-Year Plan were industry (55 percent). electric power plants (25
percent) and municipal- and personal-services facilities (16 percent). In terms of
energy parameters, one cubic meter of PC is equivalent to one liter of gasoline.
Orientiug motor transport towards using this energy carrier is a timely and sub-
stantiated, practical resolution to the most important national economic and social
problems.

Prior to the start of the 1980's. bottle-gas vehicles were produced in small indus-
trial lots. Additional production was ensured by re-equipping vehicles with gasoline
engines to accept PC. which was associated with additional one-time expenditures. In
our country, these expenditures have been 900 rubles per vehicle. In the United States

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
direct expenditures to convert a vehicle to use PG have been $600 and additional ex-
penditures of $200 connected with the construction of gas filling stations. Here the
average cost of technical servicing (T0) of bottle-gas vehicles is only 3.8 percent
higher than for carburetor vehicles, testifying to rather a high technical level of
the gas apparatus and its adaptability to monitoring-adjustment operations [2].

The mileage coefficient for bottle—gas vehicles is generally somewhat higher than
for carburetor vehicles. which is to be explained in part by the limited number of
gas filling stations and by their considerable distance from motor transport enter-
prises (ATP). For a number of well-known reasons. bottle-gas vehicles stand idle
more than vehicles with gasoline engines. so the fleet use coefficient for bottle-
gas vehicles is somewhat lower.

As of now. a small number of bottle-gas vehicles is,being operated in two ATP's of
the UkSSR Ministry of Motor Transport. The inadequate scale of introduction of
bottle-gas vehicles using PC is to be explained not by the system of motor trans-
port organization. but by the lack of modern bottle-gas vehicle designs. production
and a well-developed network of gas filling stations.

PC has a very important advantage over SNG which may predetermine its relatively
rapid introduction into motor transport. The high density of SNG vapor (as compared
with the density of air) and its diminished capacity, as compared with PC, for mix-
ing with air determines the possibility that this vapor could accumulate in artifi-
cial and natural depressions such as inspection ditches. trenches, areaways. and so
on. creating increased danger of fire or explosion. PC is lighter than air and vo-
latized quickly. avoiding the above~mentioned negative phenomena. This creates ob-
jective prerequisites for lowering demands as to categorizing AT? production premi-
ses operating bottle-gas vehicles using PC.

The methods of evaluating the knock rating of liquid fuels based on octane number
are ill-suited to gaseous fuels. This is associated in part with the fact that the
combustion processes are not identical when detonating different types of fuel. The
knock rating of gas fuels can be determined using a methane number (HCh), using as
one component of the reference mixture methane. which possesses the highest resist-
ance of all the common hydrocarbons to detonation, and hydrogen as an easily deto-
nated component [3]. The HCh of the gas being tested corresponds to the volumetric
content (in percent) of methane in a mixture with hydrogen at which operation of a
special internal combustion engine under specific test conditions causes the same
detonation as the gas fuel being tested.

Pressing problems include the development of a COST or TU for moror-transport PG to
regulate the range of components. moisture content and various impurities. "hen
filling a vehicle, reducing pressure by 1 MPa leads to a reduction of 2.S° in gas
temperature. The presence of moisture in P6 causes the formation of ice plugs in
the fuel line. PG methane content, the basic component. varies 15—17 percent as a
function of source of extraction. Such phenomena are extremely undesirable in motor
transport.

Thus. we need to work out appropriate GOST's and TU's and set up the production of

special kinds of gas fuel in order to ensure guaranteed, stable technical-operating
properties for bottle-gas vehicles.

[Preface and table of contents from book "Bending Pipe for Ship Systems", by
Boris Aleksandrovich Gorelik, "Sudostroyeniye", 4,600 copies, 168 pages]

[Text] As ships become more technically sophisticated the role and importance
of ship systems and the pipelines included in them grow. This increases the
labor-intensity of pipe work on ships. This work accounts for 10-14 percent
of the total labor-intensiveness of constructing a ship; about 65 percent of
this goes for working the pipe and 35 percent for installation and testing.

The technological process of working the pipe is being refined by introduction
of progressive equipment, use of the scale modeling method for systems and
lines, and setting up fully mechanized flow lines to work the pipe. The main
line of improvement in industrial equipment is developing and building mach-
ines. for example pipe-bending machines, that can feed the pipe, grip it, and
bend it according to program, without the use of manual labor. All these
operations are done by specialized mechanized and automated devices contro11ed
from a console. Highly qualified workers who are adequately familiar with
contemporary equipment can operate these machines.

Scale modeling presupposes the production of design documents in the form of
drawings which indicate not only the coordinates of the routes of pipelines,
but also all essential dimensions for compiling a technological chart to serve
as the basis for fabricating and working the pipe, especially bending it on
pipe-bending machines.

The formation of fully mechanized pipe-working shops envisions a complete
technological process of working pipe, beginning from semifinished parts and
resulting in pipe of the necessary configuration.

The present textbook reviews the full technological process of working pipe

in a fully mechanized shop with highly productive equipment. This distinguishes
the present book from earlier ones. which gave information only on the basic
operations of pipe working. The latest advances have been considered in writ-
ing the textbook. Primary attention was devoted to bending pipe.

Moscow PROHYSHLENNY TRANSPORT in Russian No 12, Dec 81 pp 22-26
[Article by S. I. Kcndys: "Industrial Transport in 1980"]

[Text] The publication of an annual statistical survey
of the development of the transportation and warehouse
facilities of industrial enterprises in issues Nos 11
and 12 of our journal has become a tradition. We at-
tach great importance to preparation of this laterial
because it contains sunmary information that illustrates
trends in the development of industrial transportation.
The 1980 survey is unique in that for a number of indi-
cators it summarizes not only annual figures, but also
figures for the 10th Five-Year Plan as a whole. It is
entirely possible that readers of the journal will have
specific comments and suggestions as to the form and
content of these publications. Therefore, the editorial
board earnestly requests that readers send letters and
recommendations concerning the essential features of

preparation of survey statistical materials on indus«
trial transportation.

In 1980 the volume of freight shipping in industrial transportation was 16.4
percent higher than in 1975. The dominant fonns of. industrial transportation

continued to be motor vehicles and railroads. accounting for 55.7 and 34.4
percent respectively.

Industrial railroad transportation carried 10.92 billion tons of freight last
year. Of this amount 3.68 billion tons (33.7 percent) was passed from sidings
to the rail system, 3.3 billion tons (30.2 percent) use received from the rail
system, and internal shipping reached 3.94 billion (36.1 percent). ppu8h1y 51
percent (2.01 billion tons) of all internal rail shipping occurs at ferrous
metallurgy enterprises and 20.8 percent (820 million tons) at enterprises of
the coal industry. Thus, these two industrial sectors account for about
three-fourths of the total volume of internal rail shipping.

Freight shipment at enterprises of intersectorial unified industrial rail trans-
portation increased (450 million tons a rent). The annual volume of freight
shipping on narrow-sage industrial track has dec1ined from 286.7 million tons

in 1975 to 150.7 million tons in 1980.

The freight turnover of standard-gage industrial rail transportation in 1980
reached 76.7 billion ton-kilometers (an increase of 8.2 percent during the five-
year plan). The average length of shipment of one ton of freight by standard-
gage railroad was 6.5 kilometers compared to 7.2 kilometers in 1975.

The total length of siding tracks of all gages increased 10,600 kilometers or
8.1 percent in 1976-1980, reaching a total length of 141,100 kilometers (broken
down into 108,100 kilometers of standard gage and 33,000 kilometers of narrow

sage)-

The greatest increases in the length of standard-gage railroad tracks occurred
in ferrous metallurgy, the coal industry, and the construction materials in-
dustry. 0n 1 January 1981 the length of track with type R-SO and heavier rails
had risen significantly (to 30.0 percent), and a total of 7,800 kilometers of
track had been laid on reinforced concrete ties (5.5 percent compared to 2.6
percent in 1975). During the five-year plan 7,556 kilometers of track were
electrified, including 3,358.3 kilometers in ferrous metallurgy and 1,799.6
kilometers in the coal industry. 0n 1 January 1981 automatic blocking was set
up on 1,362.6 kilometers, including 721.9 kilometers at enterprises of the
USSR Ministry of Perroua Metallurgy and 172.8 kilometers at enterprises of the
USSR Ministry of Coal Industry; 27,993 switches had been put on centralized
electric control, which raised the proportion of then to 11 percent compared to
nine percent in 1975.

To handle the increased volume of shipping and carry out technical re-equipping
during the 10th Five—Year Plan deliveries of locomotives and cars to industrial

rail transportation were increased by 28 and 27 percent respectively compared
to the Ninth Five-Year Plan.

In l976~l980 the proportion of diesel and electric locomotives in the loco-
motive fleet of industrial rail transportation rose from 85 to 94 percent,

with the principal freight-shippingndnistries having the following figures:

94 percent for the USSR Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy, 92 percent for the
USSR Ministry of Coal Industry Industry, 95.5 percent for the USSR Ministry

of Nonferrous Metallurgy. 95 percent for the USSR Ministry of Construction
Materials Industry, 95—100 percent for the machine building industries, and
87-100 percent for the construction ministries. The structure of the industrial
transportation car fleet improved: trunk line cars comprise 47.2 percent, while
industrial type cars are 28.6 percent (55.6 percent of them are dumpcars), and
other types of cars are 24.2 percent.

In the last five-year plan the proportion of specialized railroad cars in
the total fleet of cars of industrial transportation rose from 50 to 60 per-
cent. The prime cost of shipping one ton of freight for industrial rail
transportation as a whole in 1981 was 25.9 kopecks. Average car downtime on
sldltgs was 7.8 hours compared to the norm of 6.6 hours.

In 1986, the 144 industrial railroad transportation enterprises of the Main
Administration of Industrial Railroad Transportation carried 450 million tons
of freight. The volume of loading-unloading work at these enterprises was

312.2 million tons, with a prime cost of freight shipping of 5.4 kopecks per
ton—kilometer and a prime cost of freight handling of 21.2 kopecks per ton.

Departmental motor vehicle transportation continued to develop. The annual
volume of freight shipping by this form of transportation reached 17.644.000.000
tons. an increase of 13.4 percent in the five-year plan, with an average delivery
distance of 17.9 kilometers. The fleet of motor vehicles was built up and its
structure was improved by increasing the proportion of sepcialized vehicles.

and the structure of this equipment was improved. Almost half of the electric
cranes (by Balance cost) are concentrated at enterprises of the USSR ministries
of Ferrous Metallurgy. Timber. Paper and Pulp, and ﬂood Processing Industry.
Power and Electrification. and Nonferrous Metallurgy. Continuous transporta-
tion equipment (by length of lines) is concentrated at enterprises of the USSR
ministries of Construction Materials Industry, Coal Industry, and Ferrous
Metallurgy. The level of mechanization of freight processing was raised.

According to data from the USSR Central Statistical Administration, continuous
and special types of industrial transportation are developing very rapidly, es-
pecially in mining industry (pipeline, hydraulic, and pneumatic transportation,
including pneumatic container and overhead cable forms). The share of continu-
ous types of transportation in the total volume of shipping by industrial trans-
