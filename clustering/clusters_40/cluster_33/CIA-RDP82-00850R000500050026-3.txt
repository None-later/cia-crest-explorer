[Text] Japanese Economic Aid at a Turning Point

Japanese Economic Aid Under Observation at Home and Abroad; Japan Selects Path
of Major Aid Giver

Recently, Japanese economic aid has been receiving attention at home and
abroad. First, there is the expectation of a Japanese contribution to inter-
national society because of its status as a major economic power. Second,
there is the requirement for effective economic aid which will help raise

the level of welfare of the local people and give impetus to true indepen-
dence and progress in the developing countries. Third, there is growing
awareness that it is wise to choose the path of becoming "a major nonmilitsry
power" (Prime Minister Suzuki) or a "major aid-giving power" as a middle- and
long-term international strategy for Japan.

Continuing from the 1970's, many changes are expected in the world, including
Japan and Asia, in the 1980's. When we compare the economic indexes of the
developing countries of Asia with those of the major powers-~the United

States, the Soviet Union, China, and Japan--there are clearly great differ-
ences (see Table 1). However, if we develop a long-term scenario for the

world economy, there are at least six possible developments that we can imagine.

(l) Harmony will continue among the advanced capitalist countries. In this
case, international control of trade and finance by the various countries is
likely to grow.

(2) Cooperation between the advanced industrial countries will increase
under the pressure of OPEC (limited protectionism). Tariff barriers, market
divisions, and the creation of cartels will be employed to prevent semi-
developed industrial countries from joining the ranks of advanced capitalist
countries.

(3) A new international economic order will gradually be formed. The depen-
dence of the advanced countries on the developing countries will increase. and
conflicts between the advanced countries will grow.

(4) An international order will be formed which leaves out the peripheral
areas of the Third World. The elite class of the developing countries will
respond to the liberal movements of the advanced countries, and there will be a
widening gap between the "center and periphery" in the developing countries.

(5) A new international order will be built through horizontal ties in the
Third World. This is advocated by Samir Amin [phonetic] a radical in the
Third World.

(6) A revolt will occur on the periphery of the Third World. In the assess-
ment of Yale Professor J. Scott. the revolutionary energy of agricultural
classes is apparent. A revolt of Hoslen peoples centering on the Hero People's
Liberation Front in the Philippines could be supported by Al-Qadhdhafi and lead
to the formation of an Islamic alliance.

Of these forecasts of the future, there is a possibility that a combination
of (3) and (a) will actually come about during the 1980's.

Main Reasons for Reexamining Foreign Aid

When we consider this together with the trend toward multipolarization of
world politics, what can be expected to happen? The following four develop—
ments are possibilities for the foreign relations strategies of the major
pawers--the United States, the Soviet Union. and China—-in relation to the
international politics of East and Southeast Asia.

(1) The United States and China could come closer together and oppose the
Soviet Union. (2) The United States. the Soviet Union and China could carry
out relatively equidistant foreign policies and maintain a balanced situation.
(3) The Soviet Union and China could come together in opposition to the

United States. (4) The United States and the Soviet Union could come together
and isolate China.

The present situation is that of (1). Between now and the end of the 20th
century. the situation may change to (2) as it passes from (1) to (3). The
Soviet Union has military superiority over Western Europe, and is in the pro-
cess of shifting the emphasis of its world strategy to Asia. China will resist
this and Vietnam will oppose China. The conflicting relationship between North
and South Korea and the strained relationship between Indochina and the ASEAN
nations are placed in this context.

There are a number of reasons for taking a second look at the aid problem.
One is the North-South problem, the increased mutual dependence of the ad-
vanced industrial countries and the developing countries since the oil shock
of the fall of 1973. There is also the complication of the ao-called South-
South problem in which a split has occurred between the semidevsloped

3

countries and the very poor countries. Also. international stress has re-
appeared in what is called the "new cold war," the new conflicts in Bast-Heat
relations between the superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union,
because ofthe problems of Cambodia and Afghanistan.

"Economic Aid" in the Technical Sense
Strong Political Coloring

Ordinarily, when "economic aid" is discussed in the United States, Europe, or
Japan, it refers to s "flow of funds" to the developing countries from both
public and private sectors and includes aid, investment and trade. Here,
"economic aid" is essentially something that fulfills basic human needs and
contributes to the welfare of mankind and differs from overseas investment
and trade by corporations for the pursuit of private gain. Technically, it
means official development aid (ODA).

Official development aid may flow between two countries, between several coun-
tries or through an international organ (such as the World Bank or the Asian
Development Bank). Recently there has been a trend in favor of thelatter.
However, under the policies of the new President of the United States,

R. Reagan, bilateral aid carried out chiefly for national interest will be
emphasized. Multilateral aid which passes through international organs will
be cut back.

By this means, so—called economic aid will take on a markedly political char-
acter and reflect the international politics and economic conditions of an era
and the internal politics of each country. Let us look at the example of the
United States. The Marshall Plan (aid for European recovery) and the Point
Four Plan (aid to poorly developed regions) which followed World War II were
forms of humanitarian economic aid, but at the same time they also had sig-
nificance as political economic aid to rebuild the U.S.-European capitalist
camp to resist the threat of Soviet communism and maintain a stable supply of
resources and raw materials from the developing countries for this purpose.
During the greater part of the 1960's, this aid concept of the United States,
based on international politics, was used to lead the free economic bloc of
Europe and Japan in opposition to the East European and Soviet bloc. He can
still recall that until the early 1970's, in East Asia. American military and
economic aid was given to Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand and other
Southeast Asian countries in accordance with a policy of “sealing off Commun-
ist China."

Even now, American economic aid is one-fourth of the world total. The
foreign aid extended by the United States since 19b6, at the yen exchange
rate of 1976, has reached the huge total of 123 trillion yen. Hhat led the
0.8. Government and people to adopt this kind of foreign aid policy? As the
debate in Japan grows over whether the present amount of aid to the develop-
ing countries is sufficient, there is a great deal for us to learn from the
30 years' experience of the United States as a major aid-giving nation.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
As is well known, the foreign aid policy of the United States was a major part
of its overall foreign policy, and it was carried out in accordance with a
variety of goals. The £0110wing six aid concepts were formed by debate in the
legislature and among the people and continue to be in effect today.2

(1) The moral concept of aid (advocates the giving of aid without reward
from the standpoint of humanitarianism)

(2) The concept if aid for reasons of diplomacy and security (aimed at
directly affecting diplomatic negotiations and security)

(3) The concept of aid for economic profit (in pursuit of direct economic
gains through the maintenance of export markets and sources of raw materials)

(A) The concept of aid for economic development (value is placed on the pro-
cess of economic development itself)

(5) The concept of aid for political progress (given to achieve political pro-
gress in the developing countries)

(6) The concept of aid for stabilizing relationships of mutual dependence
(given to help stabilize or strengthen international relationships of mutual
dependence)

MITI Version: "Present Status and Problems of Economic Cooperation"

At the end of last year, various reports giving the views of the Japanese
Government on economic cooperation were published one after the other. These
tentative arguments included "The Present Status and Problems of Economic
Cooperation" (economic cooperation white paper), prepared by HITI, and "The
Concept of Economic Cooperation: Why Should Official Development Aid Be
Given?." prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1980 edition. HITI's
economic cooperation white paper points out the changes in the environment
for aid caused by the oil shock. It clearly explains how the OPEC price hike
offensive spoiled the economies of nonoil-producing developing countries. as
well as those of the advanced countries, causing a split between the oil—
producing countries and the nonoil—producing countries in the southern Third
Horld and causing the funds necessary for aid to be diverted to the oil-
producing countries in the form of oil mcney. However, the report lacks con-
crete policies for effectively returning the funds from the oil-producing
countries to the developing countries. It does not spell out what Japan's
role should be in energy development aid to nonoil-producing nations. It
lacks suggestions for the coordination of industry in order to deepen rela~
tionships of mutual dependence. It expounds on the significance of large-
scale joint ventures with oil—producing countries such as the Iran-Japan
petrochemical project for "advance protection from outside threats and harm—
ful effects on the Japanese economy." However, there are many problems in-
volved in Japanese-Chinese economic cooperation as seen in the Booahan steel
plant construction project in Shanghai. The report appears to be lacking in
suggestions for avoiding the dangers of large projects and for dealing with
political and economic changes and social instability of the host country.

Foreign Ministry Version: "The Concept of Economic Cooperation"

In contrast, the Foreign Ministry's "concept" report attempts to give the
reasons why Japan must increase its official development aid, in both qual-
ity and quantity, even more than the other advanced industrial countries.
It includes official development aid as part of the foreign policy of a

major aid-giving country and points out the special features of various aid
philosophies.

For example, Sweden's foreign aid aims at creating solidarity with the Third
World on the basis of a policy of active neutrality. France is enthusiastic
about spreading French culture and aims at creating a Euro-African community
with precedence given to French-speaking regions. On the other hand, the
foreign aid policy of Great Britain has the objective ofincreasing the inter-
national influence of Great Britain and advancing its national interests
globally by strengthening the unity of the Commonwealth. West Germany, stand-
ing in the narrow defile between East an‘ Heat, is attempting to bring about
a lessening of international tension by giving development help to the devel-
oping nations as well as by pursuing its policy of "Eastern diplomacy" aimed
at maintaining peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
The greatest aid-giving country, the United States, as we have seen, has
consistently pursued a policy as leader of the free world of giving aid to

protect the democratic political systems in the developing countries and to
maintain the security of the West.

In brief. the aid policies of the United States and the countries of Europe
are backed by humanistic and moral concepts of charity, a legacy of both the
Greco-Roman cultural tradition and the Christian religion. And this isclearly
interwoven into the unique individual foreign policies of each country.

The Foreign Ministry report states that ODA should be given as "part of an
overall security policy which contributes to the construction of an inter-
national order" based on "the moral obligation of rich nations to aid poor
nations" and a "a consciousness of mutual dependence between North and
South.“ It emphasizes the “significance of aid as a means of diplomacy."
It lists four factors unique to Japanese concepts of aid: (1) the cost of
being a peaceful country, (2) the cost of being a major economic power,
(3) protection against economic dependence on foreign countries, and

(4) experience in modernization as a non-Hestern country.3

The problem is that ourcountry's "comprehensive security policy" is made up
of many varied elements, such as foreign policy, economics, military, and
culture, and it is not at all clear where the main concern lies. Judging
from the government's basic policy for next year's budget formulation follow-
ing the summit meeting at which the U.S.-Japan “alliance" was proclaimed and
the move toward increased defense capability at the working level meeting of
the Security Affairs Committee attended by representatives of U.S. and Japan-
ese diplomatic and defense officials, ODA will undoubtedly be included as
garnishing in attempts to go along with the military expansion policy of the
Reagan administration. Even though we have developed a good economic aid

6

concept of our own, it will come to naught without a national consensus and
a strong will on the part of the politicians to carry it out in the form of

policy.
Hopeful View of a "Strong Japan"; Fearful of a "Military Power"

In Southeast Asia, the leaderaof the ASEAN countries desire a "strong Japan,"
but the common people had bitter experiences during Horld War II and there
remains a strongly rooted fear of Japan becoming a great military power.
Prime Minister Suzuki toured the ASEAN countries in January of this year

and promised that Japan "will not become a military power." Four months
later, the defense of the sea lanes within 1,000 nautical miles is being
undertaken and an attempt is being made to increase defense spending under
a special account. 50 suspicions about Japan are emerging once again.

Japan has been criticized by Thailand: "It is a very serious matter to
developing countries if Japan cuts its foreign aid because of increased de-
fense spending."“ And there has also been criticism from Singapore: "The
statement that Japan will not become a military power was made only to avoid
the opposition of the Japanese people and the countries of Aisa."5

This should prove that Japan could create an effective foreign policy for
increasing Japanese influence in international politics if it could carry out
effective foreign economic cooperation. Because of this, we should watch
carefully the move among the main policy-determining officials toward a re—
appraisal of the economic aid policy of the past 20 years, the setting of
new medium—range goals to double the amount of aid given in the past 5 years
over the period from 1981 to 1985 (from $10.7 billion to $21.“ billion), and
attempts to make the aid more efficient and effective.

Turning Point in the Status of Economic Aid
The Japanese System of Separate Aid Organizations

Japanese economic aid is determined and carried out on the basis of consulta—
tion under the "four ministries and agencies" council system made up of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, MITI. and the Economic
Planning Agency. This is a multicomponent aid organization with authority
residing in separate ministries like that of France and Holland. It could
be called a multidimensional aid diplomacy system. In the Western nations,
one can find "special ministry systems" as exemplified in the Economic Aid
Ministry in west Germany or systems in which the aid organs are under the
jurisdiction of the foreign policy organ and emphasize unification of foreign
relations, as seen in the Agency for International Development(AID) which
administers foreign aid as an appendage of the Department of State in the
United States. It is often noted as a feature of Japanese aid diplomacy or
aid cooperation administration that it depends on a syetamofunanimous appro-
val for decisionmaking. Therefore, without firm policy direction and leader-
ship at the top level, it becomes necessary to go through a long process of
getting compromises and concessions between ministries and making mutual ad-
justments in order to reach an agreement. In other words, there are great

7
FORIHﬂﬁCLALlﬁﬂEONLV
obstructions due to the vertical structure of the bureaucracy and the terri-
torial consciousness of the various ministries. when this is further compli-
cated by factionalist politics and lobbying, there is a tendency to have
"foreign relations turn into domestic relations."6

Minister of Finance Hatanabe proposed a reappraisal of official development
aid in the cabinet meeting of 8 May. Raising the example of Pakistan, he
asked: "Should we give economic aid to a country which has the atomic bomb?"
“2 pointed to further problems of foreign aid: "There are cases where inter-
nal wars arise because of aid." "Often, the administrators who receive the
aid build huge buildings as an expression of power and it does nothing to help
the people." He was indirectly criticizing the results of economic aid to
China. With respect to the problem of government investment inthe Saudi petro-
chemical project, he brought up issues that touch on the fundamentals of
policy making. “There is a trend toward collusion of bureaucrats and corpora-
tions which attempt to carry out foreign economic cooperation projects without
asking for the judgment of the relevant minister." "It is scandalous for
executives at the section manager level to willfully promise aid in the range
of l to 10 billion yen.“7

What Is the Desire of Countries Receiving Aid?

When we consider the status of economic cooperation in this time of change,
the most important thing is to determine what not only the government of the
target country needs but what the common people truly need and what reforms
are necessary in order to carry out the kind of economic cooperation that will
fulfill the desires of the people of the country receiving aid.

Looking at our record of official development aid to developing countries, we
see that it amounted to $3.304 billion, an increase of 25.3 percent over the
previous year, staying in fourth place behind the United States, France, and
West Germany. There was a great improvement in the percentage of the GNP,
from 0.26 percent in 1979 to 0.32 percent. However, it was still well below
the average of 0.37 percent for countries participating in the OECD Develop-
ment Aid Committee (DAC).e Japanese foreign aid cooperation became more sub-
stantial in the latter half of the 1960's. Japan provided large yen loans to
Korea, Taiwan, and lndonesia, and overseas investment by corporations grew.
Japan thus challenged the vested interests of the United States and Europe
and intensified its economic and trade relationships with the countries of
Southeast Asia (see Table 2). 0f the economic aid received by the ASEAN
countries from countries in the western camp between 1971 and 1979, 30 to 50
percent was received from Japan (see Table 3). This results from the target-
ing of "70 percent to Asia" in Japanese aid policy. This offers an effective
contrast to American, European, and Soviet aid which is aimed chiefly at Cen-
tral and South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Southern Asia.

In this way, the role of Japan in foreign economic aid to the countries of
Southeast Asia is becoming more and more important. The leaders of the ASEAN
countries are attempting to create domestic political stability by expanding
the political and economic pipeline to Japan. In particular, they are seek-
ing to achieve economic security in all areas, including aid, investment and
trade.

Prime Minister Suzuki gave a speech in Bangkok on 19 January this year in-
corporating the results of his tour of the ASEAN countries. In it he

stated: “Deepening the friendly relationship with the ASEAN countries is a
fundamental of Japanese foreign policy." He announced that the important
fields of future economic aid to the ASEAN region would be: (1) development
and promotion of agriculture, (2) energy development, (3) promotion of job
training, and (6) promotion of small and medium enterprises. The evaluation
of Japanese economic aid by the countries of Southeast Asia is fairly evenly
split between pluses and minuses, but the ratings of the rulers and the
ordinary people do not always coincide. Some of the possible reasons for this
are as follows. The common people of the developing countries have relatiVely
little opportunity to see or hear about the economic aid projccts where the
money goes to the building of the social and economic infrastr1cture such as

irrigation, electrification. or the installation of water and sewer systems
in rural villages. Even if a project is known to be Japanese, the government
elite are very proud and, while they may advertise their own accomplishments.

they will not take a posture of dependence on a foreign country that would
invite anti-establishment criticism (examples include Korea and the Philip-
pines).

The countries ofSoutheaet Asia have expanded employment and raised the income
of their people through an industrialization strategy based on foreign capi—
tal and have pursued a development policy of bringing the ripple effects of
modernization from the cities to rural society. However, the activities of
foreign private enterprise appear mainly in the major cities and are more
directly visible to the common people thrOugh the spread of consumption (food
products, clothing, electrical products, automobiles, etc). The fierce stu—
dent protest movements which occurred in Thailand and Indonesia during the

10
FOR‘OFFHJA1.USE:0NLY
visit of Prime Minister Tanaka to Southeast Asia in 1974 were not unrelated
to this "excessive advance" of foreign industry. It was an explosion of dis-
satisfaction with the unequal economic development carried out by the author-
itarian governments of these countries, the suppression of human rights, and
the instability of life.

More Active Research by Local Scholars

In recent researchers and scholars of Southeast Asian countries. as
well as those of Korea, have been actively studying and analyzing Japan's
economic aid, private investment, trade, and industrial policies. The re-
sults will influence local politics and the people's View of Japan. However,
analysis of the economic effects of aid and research on the social and poli—
tical situation by local scholars and even those of Japan are still insuffi-
cient.

The economic development desired by the peoples of Southeast Asia includes the
establishment of native industry by utilizing local resources and abilities of
local people, self-sufficiency in food production on an agricultural basis,
expansion of employment, stabilization of the international balance of trade
payments, elimination of poverty, and improvement of the standard of living.

Japanese economic aid to Thailand includes rather large yen loans, and a
mutually beneficial, friendly relationship is hoped for. However, a survey
of Thai attitudes toward Japanlo Glade by chulalongkorn University in 1978)
showed the following: (1) 45.7 percent of the general populace (45.1 per-
cent in a previous survey in 1976) and 68 percent of the elite (65 percent
in previous survey) believed that Japanese economic aid was given for the
benefit of Japan; (2) 20.7 percent of the general populace and 25.8 percent
of the elite thought that it was given for the benefit of both countries;
(3) 8.4 percent of the general populace (7.3 percent in previous survey)

and 2.3 percent of the elite (2.0 percent in previous survey) thought that
it was given to help Thailand. 80 we see that the intensification of the
economic relationship between Thailand and Japan does not necessarily have

a good effect on the perception of Japan by the common people or the elite.
In Thailand, the bureaucrats, intellectuals, and students, those who have
received a higher education, are the most severe critics of the Japanese and,
oddly, rather friendly toward China.

Strong Claims by the Southern Nations

The elite of Southeast Asia are mostly products of American or European edu-
cation. The exchange not only of political leaders but also of military
officers, scholars, and journalists has increased the human connections
between the ASEAN nations, reflecting a shared consciousness. The recent
trend is for Southeast Asians not to lean toward the United States, Europe,
Japan, or any particular country but towork together to control the influ-
ence of any major nation, including China, from outside the region and to
establish a relatively independent policy line. At U.S.-European-Southeast
Asian international conferences held in Jakarta and Singapore, strong Third
World claims were heard even from the moderates of the South.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
"The present international order has failed to improve the standard of living
of the countries of the South. Indeed, the inequality in wealth between the
advanced nations and the developing nations has reached a ratio of 35:1. A
situation is being created in which the ratio will reach 45:1 in the mid-
1980'5." "In order to promote a reform of the international order. it is
necessary forus to participate equally in international policy making."11

"The failure of American aid to the Philippines is due to ignoring the local
society and culture. Eighty percent of the agricultural technology aid from
the AID was used for salaries and service fees paid to American personnel.
Japan considers war reparations to be aid. It offered a yen loan for part
of a trans-Philippine highway and called it the 'Japan-Philippines Friend-
ship Highway. "'1

The nations of Southeast Asia are interested in the self-regeneration theories
of Mao Zedong and development policies emphasizing agriculture because of con—
cern about dependence on foreign capital as a strategy for economic develop-
ment. At present, China has begun to use foreign loans and import advanced
technology and equipment as a method of modernization. However, among the
elite class of Southeast Asia, there is a firmly rooted idea that it is
necessary to introduce reform in agriculture and among the farming population
and build up small-scale industrial technology using local resources and
manpower.13 Therefore, aid from the advanced countries from now on will be
selectively accepted when it is useful in these terms. For this reason, it

is certainly to be hoped that the four-point Asian economic aid policy
announced by Prime Minister Suzuki will be put into practice.

The economic and social development of the developing regions of the Middle
East, Africa, and Latin America, as well as Asia, cannot succeed, no matter
how much foreign aid and private investment is poured in, without methods and
policies which take into account the country's own natural, social, and eco-
nomic conditions and utilize the special features of the region. Hhen the
Soviet Union joined the aid competition in the 1960's, it is said to have
sent Russel snowplows to Guinea in tropical Africa and to have left cement
out in the rain during the monsoon season in Burma.

"The sincerity of the aid-giving country depends on whether it plans to ful-
fill 'basic needs,’ help to eliminate general poverty, in addition to aid
for general development programs" (United Nations University President
Sujatomoko [phonetic]). Future Japanese aid should maintain a posture of
giving priority to basic items for improving the living standards of the
poor common people, such as residential electrification, medical services,
and education, even though the leaders and privileged classes want things
like color television and automobiles. At the same time, private funds,
knowledge, and manpower must be mobilized in order to make the giving of aid
more efficient and systematic. The successful examples of aid in new fields
through a third sector, or through public and private cooperation, are the
ASEAN industrial linkage chart project, carried out jointly by the Asia
Economic Research Institute and the economic planning bureaus and central
statistics bureaus of the ASBAN countries, and the activities of the Japan
Energy Economics Research Institutein providing technical cooperation to the
Indonesian energy supply-and-demand data ba . Although there is a

12
I1)R‘0FFI(JAI.[EHE(MVLY
difference in the size and object of these programs, they are both given high
marks by the people involved in the partner countries as unique methods of
cooperation in activities that are fundamental to the formation of important
policies in the developing countries.‘“

In this series we will look at the deep refationship between Japan and the
developing countries. Besides analyzing the character of past economic aid
we will examine how it is evaluated by the recipient countries. Making com—
parisons with the United States and Europe, the kind of aid that is desirable
in the future will be discussed in light of present circumstances and econo—

mic plans in the various countries.

[Article by Noguyoshi Nishizawa on aid to Burma]

[Excerpt] Let us look at the aid (based on net disbursements) given to Burma
by the advanced nations and international organizations. First, bilateral aid.
From 1971 to 1979 the cumulative total of such aid was $743.9 million. of
this, $266.1 million was in grants ($60.5 million in technological cooperation)
and $477.5 million was in loans. Thus, loans made up two-thirds of the b1-
lateral aid to Burma, but the countries making the loans were limited in
number. Besides Japan, they included West Germany and Canada. Looking at

the amount of bilateral aid, we see that Japan is far in the lead with

$510 million. Next is West Germany with $108 million. These two countries
together account for by far the greatest part, 83 percent, of the cumulative
total. This may be due to the fact that Burma has a high regard for the eco-
nomic strength and the industrial technological strength of these two coun-
tries and sees them generally as not having particular political ambitions
with regard to Burma. To Burma, which stronglymwintains a position of strict
nonaligned neutrality, the factor is very significant.

After these two countries comes Australia, Canada, and Great Britain with
about $200 million, and the United States and the Netherlands with about

$150 million (cumulative totals). However, some new trends should be noted.
Aid from the socialist countries of Eastern Europe such as Czechoslovakia
and Yugoslavia has greatly increased. There is a dramatic increase in aid
from China, where similar improvements are being made. Although the United
States has been critical of the Ne Win government, it has become concerned
about recent changes in Indonesia and the stability of Burmese politics and
its economy, and it has declared its intention of again providing substantial
aid.

Some special features of the aid are that all aid from Australia, Great Bri-
tain and the United States is freely granted, and the terms of loans made by
West Germany and Canada are softer than those for loans made by Japan. For
example. West Germany gave very good terms, a repay-ant period of 50 years

and 0.75 percent interest on the loan made for the Nyanjat [phonetic] Dam
construction project which it committed itself to in 1980. In numbers, the
Japanese share of the grant element (G/E) of total aid is about the same as
that of West Germany. However, when we consider the fact that there are vari-
ous kinds of reparations and quasi-reparations included in Japanese grants,

1h
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
we have to admit that the 6/2 for general aid is quite low. As mentioned
previously, the total amount of aid given by Japan is much larger than that
of any other country, and it is possible to see the poor loan terms as com—
pensaring for that.

Next, let us survey the special features of aid from each country, beginning
with Hest Germany. Heat German aid is aimed chiefly at mining and industry.
Some of the main items are a chemical fertilizer plant, the Bassein plate
glass plant, restoration of the Bawdsin mine, a soda ash plant, expansion of
the Heinder [phonetic] tin mine, a natural gas liquefaction plant, and the
Chun Choun [phonetic] urea fertilizer plan . Recently, it has reportedly
placed emphasis on development of energy resources as well. However, no
agreement has been reached for petroleum development, in spite of the urgent
demand from the Burmese side.

Special features of this aid are a general emphasis on continuity and the
provision of product loans and the care taken not to create obstacles to the
supply of raw materials and parts. Emphasis is also placed on technology
transfer. A technological training center was opened under the No 2 Ministry
of Industry, and technicians and supervisors are being stationed permanently
in Burma to give technological guidance. Also, West Germany has the best
record in aid related to technological assistance. The total of its tech-
nological assistance from 1971 to 1979 was $258 m‘llion. Canada was in
second place but far behind $110 million).

Australia's total aid of $21.8 million is not a very large figure, but the
fact that it is all a free grant is an important feature. The main object of
this aid is the infrastructure, and in this field, Australia has a long
record of achievement in road construction and repair. In addition, it is
carrying out a rural water supply project together with UNICEF. In agricul—
ture-related projects, it is building irrigation systems and rice store-
houses.

The aid to Burma from international organizations in the period from 1971 to
1979 reached a total of $347.5 million. This was about one-third of the
total amount of aid (the sum of aid from single countries and from inter-
national organizations). The major international aid organizations are the
International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank (ADD), and the various United Nations organizations. The
total aid from the IDA was $115.2 million, the next largest amount of aid
after that of Japan. Burma went back to accepting aid from the Horld Bank
in 1973. This aid has continued to increase steadily since that time and
has played a major role in Burma's economic development. IDA aid is mainly
given for agriculture and transportation. These two fields account for about
two-thirds of the IDA aid. In the future, the uses of IDA aid will be ex-
panded to include fishing, mining, and electric power. The loan terms are
extremely lenient. For the Nyanjat [phonetic] Dam project, which was com-
mitted to in 1980, the repayment period is 50 years, with a grace period of
10 years, and no interest is required. Also, the amount of the loan for

this project ($90 million) is the largest of any World Bank aid projects in
Burma.

15
F0l40FFKJAl.USE(NNLY
The total amount of ADB aid is $96.4 million, about the same as that of West
Germany. The special feature of the ADB aid is that it extends over a rela-
tively wide variety of fields. In comparison with the IDA, which emphasizes
aid for agricultural development, the ADB emphasizes industrial fields.

3. Japanese Aid to Burma

As I have mentioned, Japan is the largest source of aid to Burma. Japanese
aid to Burma began with free financial assistance based on the reparations
agreement which went into effect in April 1955. Since then, Japan has con-
tinued to provide large amounts of financial and technological assistance.
The total of official financial assistance to Burma between 1955 and the end
of December 1980 (based on official documents exchanged) has reached a total
of 311.9 billion yen. Of this, 45.5 percent, or 141.96 billion yen, is un-
compensated assistance, and the remaining 169.98 billion yen is compensated
assistance.

(1) Uncompensated Financial Cooperation

Uncompensated financial assistance to Burma can be roughly broken down into
(1) reparations, (2) quasi-reparations, and (3) miscellaneous aid. Repara-
tions are based on the reparations pact signed in November 1954 and they were
paid over a 10-year period from April 1955 to April 1965. The main projects
for which reparations were used were: (1) the Baloochan [phonetic] hydro-
electric power plant (output of 84 MW), (2) the so-called "old four" indus-
trial projects (light rolling stock manufacturing, heavy rolling stock manu—
facturing, farm tool and equipment manufacturing, and electrical equipment
manufacturing), and (3) purchase of machinery and transportation equipment.
The reparations payments wereused as follows: 10.4 billion yen went to the
Baloochan [phonetic] hydroelectric power plant, 10.5 billion yen to the "old
four" projects, and 51.1 billion yen to other projects. The Baloochan [phone-
tic] hydroelectric power plant is still the largest source of electric power
in Burma and it plays a very large role in the industrialization of Burma and
the supply of private electric power. Also, the "old four" projects can be
said to have built the foundations for the further industrialization of Burma.

However, in 1973 Japan considered a request by the Burmese Government for re-
evaluation of a comparative imbalance in the reparations to Burma as compared
with that to other countries, and a new economic and technological cooperation
agreement was concluded. On the basis of this agreement, a total of 47.34
billion yen in uncompensated assistance was provided over a 7-year period

from April 1965 to 1972. This is what is referred to as "quasi-reparations."
The main project funded by these quasi-reparations was an expansion of the
"old four" projects. The amount invested in this was 432.9 billion yen.

Following the reparations and quasi-reparations, ordinary uncompensated
assistance was given continuously after 1975. The total of this assistance
reached 226.3 billion yen by December 1980. This was made up mainly of
general grants and aid for increased food production a 7:3 ratio. Large
amounts came out of the general grants for a biomedical research center

(3.5 billion yen) and a metallurgy research center (2 billion yen). The aid

16
Ftﬂlfﬂﬂﬂ(1Al.USE10NLY
for increased food production was spent for supply of fertilizer, farming
tools and equipment. and methods to increase rice harvests. This coincides
with the Burmese Government's policy emphasis on agricultural development
and enjoys a good reputation.

(2) Compensated Financial Cooperation

Compensated financial assistance to Burma was started in February 1969. By
the end of December 1980 the total value of loans had reached 170 billion
yen. Of this, 108.4 billion yen (63.7 percent) went to project aid and 61.6
billion yen (36.3 percent) went for commodity aid. An interest rate of

3 percent was applied up to the eighth yen loan (excluding the first and
seventh yen loans). After that it was gradually reduced. From 1979 on, the
rate was 2.25 percent. The repayment period before 1977 was 25 years and
after that it was changed to 30 years. So the terms of the loans have im-
proved slightly. However, as observed previously, these lending terms are
poorer than those of other countries and international organizations.

The object of compensated financial assistance is mainly industrial and energy
resource development. In the industrial field, a large amount of aid is con—
tinuously received for the four industrialization projects. The total loan
amount, including both project and commodity loans, is 65.34 billion yen,
about one-third of the total compensated financial cooperation. Aid has been
given continuously for a variety of purposes in the four projects throughout
the postwar period, beginning with the payment of reparations. A production
system was finally established, and certainly a great contribution was made

in such areas as the supply of products within the country, industrial tech-
nology transfers, and expansion of employment. However, it is also true that
some problems exist. The first of these is that because aid has been perpe-
tualized, there is a lack of effort for autonomous progress, and a system that
can pay for itself without aid has not been established. The second problem
is that these industries have not yet been transformed into export industries,
as originally planned by the Burmese Government. And there are other problems
that can be pointed out. A great deal of rationalization extending to all
aspects of business operations is required to solve these problems. And from
now on. aid will be necessary in "soft" areas such as management, informa-
tion, and marketing.

Other major industrial projects include construction of a ceramic products
manufacturing works, the Bagasu [phonetic] pulp and paper mill, a cement
plant, and a rice mill. There are also some energy-related industrial pro-
jects, such as a natural gas turbine power plant (fourth yen loan). the Syrian
oil refinery expansion project (eighth yen loan), and the Man oil refinery.
For energy resource development, a test drilling for oil was made off the
Gulf of Hartaban with the sixth yen loan in 1973. And a yen loan was made in
1980 for offshore oil field development. of course, this large amount of
energy-related financial cooperation has been provided because of the in-
crease in the price of crude oil in recent years brought about by the energy
crisis. It is also due to the fact that Burma has very promising drilling
areas, and the Burmese Government is making a determined effort to develop
energy resources in order to export petroleum and gain foreign currency.

4. Conclusion

As I have explained here, the Burmese Government has turned its policies
toward the active use of foreign aid in order to break cut of a long period
of economic stagnation. Since that time, a rather large amount of aid has
flowed in, and this is having a great impact on the Burmese economy. It

goes without saying, however, that borrowings that correspond to Burma's eco-
nomic strength are desirable when bringing in foreign capital. One guideline
for controlling a country's borrowing is what is known as the debt service
ratio (DSR). The DSR is the rate found by dividing the debt repayment

amount (principal plus interest) for each year by the amount of exports.
Burma's DSR is rising dramatically. This is a serious problem, because it
has already passed the danger line of 20 percent. Furthermore, much of the
borrowing on an ODA basis comes under the 10-year grace period for repayment.
This is expected to have a serious effect in the late 1980's, when the re-
payment amount will increase enormously.

Therefore, the issue forced upon the Burmese economy for the immediate future
is how to expand exports. Besides the immediate objective of increasing
Burma's debt repayment ability, this is also necessary as an engine for
growth, to compensate for the limited domestic market. Foreign aid should
also be provided from the standpoint of promoting exports. For this purpose,
it is necessary to reform the monoculture type ex;ort structure and diversify
export products. In order to do this, priority suould be given to the use of
aid funds for development of primary products which have not been sufficiently
developed (especially agricultural products other than rice, forest products,
marine products, and mineral products like petroleum and natural gas).

In addition, it is necessary to develop the labor—intensive industries into
export industries. Burma has an abundant supply of a broad range of cheap

labor. Positive utilizatio: of this labor strength is of great social and

economic significance. Sin~ domestic investment by foreign countries is

now prohibited, it would seat-nat aid funds should be actively used for the
growth of these industries.

[Text] At the Stage of Determining a Method of Evaluation
1. The Domestic Economy and Transitions in Foreign Aid

(1) Domestic Economy

Since independence (1956) the Philippine economy has continued to rely heavily
on agriculture. Philippine agriculture is roughly divided between food crops
such as rice and corn and export crops such as sugar and coconuts. At pres-
ent, agriculture makes up 4h.3 percent of the GDP and employs 60 percent of
the working population.

25
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
For this reason, the Philippines Government has looked to industrialization as
the path to postwar economic independence and progress, as have other develop-
ing countries. The beginning of industrialization in the Philippines was
rather early among Asian countries. By the early 1950's, industrialization
for import substitution had begun. Restrictions on imports and foreign
currency were put into effect in 1949 to cope with the seriously growing
deficit in international balance of payments. This resulted in encouraging
domestic production in the manufacturing industries.

The import substitution industrialization policy was quite successful until
1960. In particular, from 1949 to 1956, the growth of manufacturing indus-
tries was a phenomenal 15.8 percent. However, going into the 1960's, an im-
passe was reached and a number of problems appeared. There was a tendency
toward tightening of the local market and an increase in capital-intensive
goods. Because of plants being located close to urban areas, not enough em-
ployment opportunities were created. And there was difficulty in obtaining
foreign capital because of failure to develop eXport industries.

In the 1970's, the government reviewed this situation and changed its indus-
trial policy from import substitution to an export orientation. It also be-
gan to plan for development of farming villages and rural areas with an empha-
sis on agriculture, which had previously been ignored because of the effort

to industrialize. In addition, President Marcos instituted martial law in
1972 (suspended in January 1980) and promoted further economic development
through a policy of introducing foreign capital and loans.

In the midst of these developments, self-sufficiency in rice production was
achieved in 1977 through movements for increased rice production such as
Hasagana 99 which was started in 1973. Some rice was even shifted to export
category. Also, by developing industries that were candidates for export
business, the export of industrial products grew until nontraditional manu-
factured products accounted for 36 percent of the total exports in 1980.
During the 1960's and 1970's the average growth of the GDP was fairly good,
5.1 percent, and 6.3 percent respectively.

However, strains in the economic structure began to appear. First, there

was a chronic deficit in trade payments because of the continuous increase

in imports of the intermediate and raw materials necessary for industrializa-
tion. Deficits in the international balance of payments had to be compen-
sated with a long- and short-term influx of capital. More recently, this
trade deficit was aggravated further by the oil crises of 1973 and 1979.

The proportion of crude oil in total imports grew from 12.7 percent in 1973
to 20.7 percent the following year, and it then moved to a level of 22 or 23
percent. In 1980, following the second oil crisis, it jumped to 28.2 percent.

Also, foreign obligations have increased since 1972 and are putting a heavy
strain on the Philippines economy. Until 1972, when martial law was put into
effect, the amount of foreign obligation was $2.2 billion; 3 years later it
was Si billion; by 1978, it had almost doubled, reaching $7.78 billion; in
1980, it broke the $10 billion mark, reaching a record $12.27 billion. This
is equivalent to 34.6 percent of the GNP and the debt service ratio moved
close to the legal limit of 20 percent.

26
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
In 1980, the Philippine economy had a growth rate of only 4.8 percent, the
worst record in recent years. The inflation rate was 17.6 percent, staying
in the double digit range for a second consecutive year. The Philippines
was afflicted with the general economic stagnation common to other nonoil-
producing countries. With chronic deficits in trade payments and the in-
ternational balance of payments, growing foreign debt, and soaring infla-
tion, the Philippines has many problems. And the future economic outlook
does not leave room for optimism.

(2) Foreign Aid

Postwar aid to the Philippines began with direct grants from the United States.
For 5 years after the war, from 1946 to 1950, it gave a total of $800 million
in direct grants as postwar recovery funds. Most of the aid in the 1950's
also came from the United States. The emphasis shifted from postwar recovery
aid to aid for long-term and fundamental development of the Philippine econ-
omy. In 1952, the Ouirino-Foster pact was made between the United States and
the Philippines, and In 1956 the Laurel-Langley pact was signed. In 1956,

a reparations agreement was reached between the Philippines and Japan.

Inthc1960's, there was uncompensated assistance from such countries as West
Germany and compensated assistance from the World Bank. Then in the late
1960's, compensated assistance began to come fron the Asian Development Bank.
Because of this, the relative importance of the United States decreased. On
the other hand, the country which was receiving the aid, the Philippines,
attempted to change its policy from total support of the United States to
more diverse relations of friendship and economic cooperation.

In the 1970's, the number of aid-giving countri:s and organizations expanded
and the forms of aid were also diversified. Especially after the Consulta-
tive Group for the Philippines was formed under the sponsorship of the Hbrld
Bank in 1971, the amount of foreign aid grew rapidly. From 1971 to 1974, the
promised amount of development aid surpassed that for the previous 20 years.
There was also a great change in the content of aid after 1970. The propor-
tion of direct grants declined greatly, from a previous level of 60 percent
to about 20 percent in recent years. One important change is that Japan is
now the largest source of aid to the Philippines, although its contribution
was very small before 1971. The major countries giving aid to the Philippines
at present are Japan, the United States, Australia and west Germany. Among
international organizations, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
supply the greatest proportion of aid (see Table 1).

Beginning in 1979, the Philippines launched 11 large industrial projects,
and it is now working to develop heavy and chemical industries. In July
1980, it announced a 5-year plan for energy which was a revision of a previ-
ous 10-year plan, and it is actively working on energy development. The
former projects will require a total expenditure of $6 billion. The latter
is expected to require $9.5 billion. Half of both of these sums will have
to come out of foreign aid, so it will continue to be impossible to break
away from dependence on foreign aid. The ODA promised to the Philippines
by the Consultative Group for the Philippines for 1981 was $1.2 billion.

2. Aid From Major Countries and International Organizations
(1) Major Countries

Total American aid to the Philippines between 1946 and 1979 was $1.1 billion.
of that amount, $720 million tookthe form of grants and loans, and the rest
was food. Looking back on past aid, we find that aid was first given for the
rebuilding of the country and was concentrated on agriculture, hygiene, and
construction. In the late 1950's, the emphasis in aid shifted to investment
for industrial development and improvements in government management tech-
niquea. In the 1960's, foreign aid was reexamined, and through enactment of
the Foreign Aid Law, the emphasis shifted from industrial development to
agricultural production, regional development, and social problems. In the
1960's, there was an emphasis on construction of infrastructure and this was
carried over to the 1970's. In 1973, there was a second policy change. The
improvement of the standard of living of poor rural villagers took first pri-
ority, and this policy has also been carried down to the present. The policy
for the neat 5 years (1981—1985) has been clearly formulated to provide aid
to landless peasants.

Australian aid to the Philippines goes back to the Colombo plan of 1952. The
total amount from 1952 to June 1979 was 60.9 million Australian dollars. This
aid was chiefly divided into capital project aid, technological assistance,
and food assistance. All of it was given in the form of grants. A character-
istic of the capital assistance is that it was limited to particular regions.
The aid policy of the Australian Government, limited to capital aid to the
Philippines, has been to specify a region, and when theproject (comprehensive
development) was completed there, to move to another region. The projects
underway at present are the Zamboanga Del Salle [phonetic] development pro-
ject (begun in 1974) and the Northern Samar comprehensive regional develop—
ment project (begun in 1979). Since all Australian aid to the Philippines is
in the form of direct grants, the aid process is working smoothly without any
special problems.

West German aid to the Philippines has bccone substantial only in recent years.
Some reasons for this are that American influence was traditionally strong
there, and then subsequently the Japanese moved in. There are three kinds

of West German aid: regular aid programs, irregularaidprograms, and tech-
nological aid. The irregular aid was started in 1962 and the regular aid be-
gan in 1969. The total capital aid from 1962 to 1979 was DH 751.3 million.
The terms for this capital assistance have generally been an interest rate of
2 percent, a 10-year grace period, and a 30—year repayment period. Most of
the aid has been concentrated in harbor facilities and electrical power. The
Rest German Government is very concerned about West German public opinion with
respect to aid to the Philippines. This is because public Opinion in West
Germany is very critical of the Marcos government.

(2) International Organizations

Up to 1980 there were 73 loan proposals for loans from the World Bank to the
Philippines, and the total amount of loans was 32.512.100.000. Seventy of

28

these loans, or 52.389.900.000. came from the World Bank itself and 3 of them.
or $122.2 million, wereloaned by the IDA (International Development Associa-
tion). The terms of World Bank loans have become more stringent in recent
years. In 1980, the loan terms included a repayment period of 15 years
(5-year grace period) and aninterest rate of 8.25 percent. The amount of aid
in 1980 was about $400 million or 60 percent of the total aid given to the
Philippines. In 1980, the World Bank gave a structural improvement loan of
$200 million to the Philippines for the first time. The major objective of
this was an attempt by the World Bank to make up for the extreme deteriora-
tion in the international balance of payments accompanying the domestic eco-
nomic revolution. There are three specific areas for which loans were given--
a coal conversion project for energy development and the fuels used in the
cement industry, a restoration and modernization plan for the fiber industry,
and expansion of exports through increased construction of export-processing
regions and expansion of preferential loans for exports.

Loans from the World Bank to the Philippines, perhaps partly because the head-
quarters are in Manila, have increased rapidly in the last few years. At the
end of 1980, there were 46 loans to the Philippines from the general fund and
7 from the development fund. The loan amount included $1,067,050,000 from the
general fund and $04.3 million from the development fund for a total of
$1,131,350,000. There were 34 instances of techn logical aid totaling

$5.91 million. In tenms of the total loans to a .articular country, 1980

was the first year that the Philippines moved int: first place, ahead of
Korea, which got 31.172.030.000 [sic]. The average terms of the loans from
the general fund given in 1980 were a repayment period of 21 years (3.75 year
grace period) and an interest rate of 8.8 percent. For the loans from the
development fund, the average conditions were much more lenient, a repayment
period of 40 years (10-year grace period)and an interest rate of 1 percent.
Breaking down the loan proposals by category, we find that the largest amount,
19.1 percent, went for electric power. This was followed by 18.7 percent for
industry, 15.0 percent For water supply, 12.7 percent for roads, and 11.3 per—
cent tor irrigation. Thus, these categories made up 76.8 percent of the total.

3. Japanese Aid

(1) General Conditions

Japanese economic assistance to the Philippines goes back to the reparations
agreement reached in 1956. Japan paid reparations over a period of 20 years
up to l976-$25 million a year for the first 10 years and $35 million a year
for the second 10 years, for a total of $555 [sic] million. This was the
largest amount of reparations paid by Japan to any country. It was almost
twice the amount of reparations paid to Indonesia, Burma or Thailand. The
reparations breakdown by purpose was as follows: 65.4 billion yen for public
utilities, 49.57 billion yen for transportation and communications, 30.07
billion yen for manufacturing industries, 12.85 billion yen for agriculture
and forestry, 9.32 billion yen for medical equipment, and 22.99 billion yen
for other fields. Thus, there was a broad range of items procured with the
reparations, and they played an important role in Philippine economic

29
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
development. For example, 29.2 percent of the foreign currency financial
sources ($498.98 million) for government infrastructure investment in the 4-
year period from 1972 to 1975 came from reparations.

The aid up to 1960 mainly consisted of reparations and technological co-
operation. However, in the 1970's there was greatdiversification of aid,
including compensated financial assistance, such as yen loans and deferred
payment exports of Japanese rice, and uncompensated aid, such as cultural
grants and food assistance (see Table 2). Technological cooperation was
still included. The first compensated form of aid was the joint loan from
the Export-Import Bank of Japan and 13 city banks agreed upon in 1969 for

the Japan-Philippines Friendship Highway. Following that, Japanese yen loans
began in 1971, and nine yen loans were made between then and 1981.

Japanese aid to the Philippines on a bilateral basis became the largest of
any country, exceeding that of the United States, in 1972. The record for
197) (based on expenditures) was $89 million, or 52.3 percent of the aid re-
ceived from single countries (see Table l). The 1979 aid included $51.25
million in government loans, $31.91 million in grants, and $17.65 million in
technological cooperation. The uses of the eighth yen loan are shown in
Table 3. A loan agreement for the ninth yen loan, 62 billion yen ($187.11
million), was concluded on 9 June 1981. The loan will be made under special
terms, a repayment period of 30 years (a grace period of 10 years) and an
interest rate of 3 percent. It will be used for the following seven pro-
jects: (1) the Negros southern geothermal power generation project

($48.1 million), (2) the Northern Luzon power generation network project
($33.9 million), (3) the Isabela Bay special wharf project ($33.7 million),
(4) the second Japan-Philippines Friendship Highway project ($28.1 million),
(5) the first Ilocos Norte Province irrigation project ($22.3 million),

(6) a power transmission line construction project ($20.5 million), and

(7) a consulting service for railroad rolling stock and facilities ($510,000).

(2) The Status and Evaluation of Assistance

As we have seen. Japanese aid to thr Philippines has been the greatest of
any single country. Because of this, Philippine expectations of Japan are
great. However, whether or not Japanese aid will be used effectively is a
separate question. The amount of USAID aid is less than that of Japan, but
USAID has a regional office in Nags in addition to the Manila office and a
permanent staff there. It has 159 staff members, including Filipinos, in
its Philippine offices, and they are engaged in administering detailed as-
pects of aid activities. In comparison, there are only two people in the
Manila office of the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OBCF), and
they are overwhelmed with the daily work10ad. If there is to be truly effec-
tive aid to a particular country, it will be necessary for a permanent staff
to be continuously committed to a project from beginning to end (even after
completion of the actual work) of the project. From this standpoint, we can
say that the size of the Japanese staff is far too small, and a system for
effective aid administration has not yet been established.

30
FOR OFHCIAL USE ONLY
The Philippine Government has requested several things concerning aid. The
completion of projects is constantly delayed because of a shortage of domes-
tic currency funds, so it is asking the aid-giving countries to take a share
of the domestic currency burden. It wants a reduction in the excessive tine
required from feasibility studies to completion of projects. It also wants

to eliminate the restrictions onorders for equipment and materials connected
with aid. In response, Japanese aid at present has been made to cover 30 per-
cent of the local currency burden, and procurement is now generally untied,
unlike the situation before 1987. So inprovunents are being made which are
gradually meeting the desires of the local government.

The period necessary for project evaluation varies with the project, but
usually a period of 5 to 10 years is required. Japanese yen loans to the
Philippines have a short history, having begun in 1971, and they have just
reached the stage where evaluation is possible. Unquestionably, this eval-
uation is essential to making Japanese aid effective in the future. Prepara-
tions are now being made at the Institute of Asian Economic Affairs for
evaluation of Japanese aid. The evaluation work is scheduled to begin next
year, and good results are hoped for.

During the visit of Prime Minister Suzuki to the ASBAN countries, local eco-
nomic journals carried special articles on Japanese economic aid, but there
wereno commentaries that went as far as project evaluation. The past achieve-
ments of Japanese economic aid were presented, but this included only the
Cagayan Valley rural development, electrification projects,.and technological
cooperation. There is not yet much general interest in Japanese aid projects.
The true effectiveness of Japanese aid will likely come into question when
there is further growth in public interest.

1. The Korean Economy and Foreign Aid
(1) American Military Support

The Republic of Korea became independent in 1948, and the Korean war broke
out (in 1959) before it was able to absorb the ac nomic and social disruption
that accompanied the split between north and souta. The war resulted in thor-
ough destruction of the land, and many industrial facilities lost their

capacity to produce.

Following the signing of the truce agreement in l953, under the Syngman Rhee
government, the ROK set out to rebuild its economy while relying on economic
aid from America and the United Nations. The mcin financial source for the
United Nations was the United States, so the aid to the ROK was in reality
borne entirely by the United States. However, the American aid to the ROK
during thisperiod had the strong character of military support to the ROK as
the front line against communism, and it was not necessarily aimed at econo-
mic development. In other words, in addition to furnishing direct military
expenses for arms, etc., America also gave economic aid to the Korean Govern-
ment to help assist in the burden of wages for the 500,000-600,000 members of
the Korean military forces. Because of this, the majority of American econo-
mic aid took the form of donations of consumer commodities or raw materials
which could easily be turned into cash (surplus agriculturalproducts as de-
fined by American Public Law No 680). The cash received for them was applied
to military expenditures, which made up 30-40 percent of ROK Government expen-
ditures. This American economic aid to support the Korean military, as shown
in Table l, amounted to an annual average of $250 million for the 10 years
from 1954 to 1963. This decreased to an annual average of $100 million in the
late 1960‘s, and fell to almost nothing in the 1970's.

Although the American aid to the Pak Chong-hui government was not directly in-
tended for the economic development of Korea, it provided an opportunity to
deVelop industries which processed the coucdities given as aid (fiber and

food industries such as the cotton industry, flour milling, and sugar refining).

Thus it allowed for a certain accumulation of industrial capital and the

appearance of a class of business managers. And this undeniably formed the
foundations for the industrialization of Korea from the 1960's on.

(2) Industrialization and the Introduction of Foreign Capital Under the Pak
Government

The Pak Chong-hui government came into power through a military coup d'ctat

in 1961. It instituted several 5-year plans beginning in 1962, and forcefully
promoted industrialization under government leadership. In order to gain the
funds for industrialization, it worked actively to bring in foreign capital.
This coincided with the foreign economic aid policies of President Kennedy.
who at the time was attempting to shift the economic aid to Korea from

direct aid for the purpose of military support to development assistance
credits.

In this way, the Pak government changed the foreign policy of the Rhee govern-
ment, which had been very closed to foreign countries with the exception of its
dependence on the United States. Particular importance was placed on Japan,
which was close geographically and growing economically at a rapid rate. In
1965. the Korean Government overcame the opposition of its people, who had
strong anti-Japanese feelings, and achieved normalization of Korean-Japanese
relations. From then on, there was 1 large inflow of public and private capi-
tal from Japan. Industrialization was pushed ahead quickly. The United States
and the countries of Europe took notice of the growth potential of the Korean
economy, and the capital inflow from these sources steadily increased. As
shown in Table 2, the annual average of foreign capital (loans for more than

3 years and direct foreign investment) during the first 5-year period (1962-
1966) was only on the average of $60 million per year. However, this grew
rapidly to $450 million during the Second Five-Year Plan (1967—1971),

$1.2 billion during the Third Five-Year Plan (1972-1976), and $2.7 billion in
the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-1980).

Looking at the content of capital inflow to Korea from 1962 to 1980, we can
say that public loans were initially the main component, but around the time
of normalization of Japanese-Korean relations in 1965 private loans became
the main item, and after 1970 direct investment by foreigners became impor-
tant. The sum total of direct foreigner investment as of June 1981 was

$1.165 billion. Host of this was joint venture investment in local industry.
In many cases, private loans were introduced in parallel to make up for
shortages of operating funds.

Looking at this, we can conclude that the industrialization of Korea under
the Pak government was achieved through economic cooperation on a private
basis. In any event, today's Korea has emerged as a semideveloped industrial
country in Asia and belongs among the ranks of advanced countries more than
among recipients of official development aid. It has even attempted to pro-
vide economic assistance to less developed countries. The ROK's overseas
investment balance (credits and direct investment), was only $12.6 million

at the end of the 1960's. By the end of the 1970's, it was over $500 million.

2. Economic Aid to Korea From Other Countries
(1) General Features

The provision of ODA to Korea by various foreign countries in the 1970's is
shown in Table 3. In 1979, the total 00A to Korea (net receipts) was only
$136 million, a 40-percent reduction from the $324 million of 1971. Multi-
lateral aid gradually increased during the 1970's, but in 1979 it only com-
manded 10 percent of the total. At the beginning of the 1970's, 90 percent
of the bilateral aid case from just two countries, Japan and the United
States. By the end of the decade, this percentage had dropped to 60 percent,

37
FOR‘OFINCJAI.lEﬂE(MVLY
but it still comanded a strong share of the total. In 1979, West Germany
gave 15 percent of the total. but the aid from other Western European coun-

tries was close to nil.

Most of the aid was in the form of credits, but while both direct aid and
credits diminished, the ratio between credits and direct aid stayed at about
75:25 throughout the 1970's. In any case, the position of ODA is becoming
less important each year in relation to the total amount of funds required
for Korean economic development, and today it has lost its significance.

(2) Characteristics of Various Countries' Economic Aid to Korea

\- “ritan ODA tr- Korn. was $175 million in 1971, about half of the total.

111 1979. it had dropped to only $211 million and its percentage of the total
had dropped to 25 percent. In terms of the types of aid, America comanded

29 percent of the 0011 to Korea in 1971 with direct grants of $51 million,

but in 1979 it had fallen to a mere 4 percent with grants of $1 million.

The majority of the American Goverment credits to Korea were long-term de-
ferred payment uports of surplus agricultural products under U.S. Public Law
No 1180. This had the feature of increasing or decreasing depending on Korean
food production. In recent years, this aid has also decreased greatly because
Korea has begun importing foodstuffs in ordinary form.

The Korean National Academy of. Sciences was built as a kind of memorial to
direct aid in 1970, but there were no other such visible results. However,
this became a means of encouraging a reversal of Korea's brain drain, so it
had very high exhibition value as a symbol of technological progress.

38
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
West German ODA to Korea was small in absolute terms, but the percentage of
direct aid was very high, and this was a big difference compared with Japan
and the United States. Of the $157 million in total West German ODA to
Korea in the period from 1971-1979, $62.2 million or 40 percent was direct

grants. This was nuch larger than Japan's 24 percent and America's 10 per-
cent. '

looking at the content of West German ODA to Korea, the main feature was
technology-related assistance such as educational facilities (technical high
schools) and the acceptance of students for technical training.

Economic aid on a multilateral basis from the Horld Bank or the Asian Devel-
opment Bank has gradually increased. Also, an inflow of government credits
from the OPEC countries began to increase in the latter part of the 1970‘s.
These funds were mainly used to form indirect capital for social development.
This included construction of dams, highways, and communication facilities.

3. Japanese Economic Aid to Korea
(1) General Features of Economic Aid

Japanese economic aid to Korea began with the nornalization of relations
between Japan and Korea which took place in 1965. This consisted of $300
million in grants and $200 million in government credits agreed upon in the
claims and economic cooperation pact. Because of the peculiarities of the
negotiation process, this was referred to as "quasi-reparations" by the
Japanese and "claim funds" by the Koreans and was handled separately from
general ODA. Specifically, the ROK saw this as compensation for legitimate
claims and did not want to include it under the category of economic aid.
And in reality, it differed from general ODA which is applied to successive
separate projects. It was arranged so that the ROK Government would set up
projects autonomously within prescribed limits ($300 million in grants,
$200 million in credits), and would request the necessary materials and per-
sonnel from Japan. These "quasi-reparations" were provided in installments
over a 10-year period from 1966 to 1975.

Beginning in 1971, general direct aid and credits went into effect that were
separate from these "quasi reparations." For these, negotiations were car-
ried out for each project, and loan agreements were concluded. This became
the regular style of ODA to Korea from then on.

Provision of capital (credit) on a private basis also began with the normali-
zation of relations in 1965. Host of this was in the form of deferred payment
exports using the Export-Import Bank of Japan. Also, serious direct invest-
ment by Japanese companies began in the early 1970's, and it came to be a
majority of the direct investment by foreigners in the ROK.

Table 4 shows overall'figures for these categories of Japanese economic
assistance to the ROK during each 5-year plan. These are statistics from ROK
sources for loans made for 3 or more years and direct foreigner investment.

The "quasi-reparations" mentioned above are excluded. Generally speaking,

the initial "quasi-reparations" built the foundations of economic exchange
between Japan and the ROK. Afterward, the main assistance was the deferred
payment exports utilizing funds from the Export-Import Bank of Japan. In

the first half of the 1970's, direct investment (company operations in the
ROK) came to be on a par with other forms of assistance. In du:latter half
of the 1970's, the ROK seriously undertook the establishment of heavy and
chemical industries, and deferred payment exports again became the main form
of aid. Private economic assistance became important along with the growth in
the Korean economy. This was confirmed on a political level by a joint state-
ment of "the central role of private economic assistance" at the Japan-ROK
periodic ministerial conference in 1978. As shown in Table 4, there was an
annual average of $100 million in yen credits during the 1970's. This

dropped relative to other forms of economic assistance, and when we consider
the decline in the dollar during that period, we see that it also shrank in
absolute terms.

(2) Japanese ODA to the ROK

0n the basis of exchanged documents, the Japanese ODA to the ROK between 1965
and 1980, including "quasi-reparations," reached a total of 541.18 billion yen.
A breakdown of this aid is shown in Tahlc 5.

Some notable projects from the compensated and uncompensated "quasi-
reparations" were the Soyang River Dam construction project (4.6 percent of
the total) and the steel and iron industrial complex at Pohang (22.6 percent).

The Soyang Dam construction project was the first major development project in
the great river basins of the ROK after liberation, and it became a model for
similar projects carried out afterward. It made the 80K Government aware of
the possibilities and importance of development of the four great rivers (the
Han, the Naktong, the Kum, and the Yongsan). And this project became a prac-
tical arena for the rapid improvement of the technical level of Korean civil
engineering and construction industries, which had been in a period of
infancy.

The other project, the Pohang industrial complex, was a plan to build a com-
plete steel-making plant on an international scale. It was a memorial to ROK
industrialization under the Pak government. Negotiations for this project
were carried out between the ROK Government and the United States and other
Western countries which were to provide loans. However, these negotiations
ended in disagreement, and the ROK was forced to bring the project under the
framework of the "quasi-reparation" funds. There were some who were afraid
that it would prove to he too much of a burden to the Korean economy, which at
that time was in the early stages of industrialization. However, because of
the character of the "quasi-reparations" explained above, this project was
carried out in accordance with the wishes of the hlx Government. The Pohang
steel complex, built with "quasi-reparations," had an annual production capac-
ity of 2.5 million tons. It was further expanded with privately based econo-
mic assistance and now has an annual project of 8.5 million tons. It has
attracted attention as an example of a "boomerang effect," whereby its pro-
ducts now compete with those of Japanese steelmakers on the world market.

If we look at ODA given to the ROK after 1971, we find that the uncompensated
part, or direct grants, included provision of facilities, equipment, and
materials for technical educational institutions up to 1976, and materials
and equipment for medical institutions from 1977 on.

The compensated portion was half commodity assistance, including food, and
half project assistance. Most of the projects were conventional indirect
social capital projects, but beginning in the late 1970's, aid was received
for the educational and medical sector. Attention began to move a step ahead
of economic development to basic social development. Also, assistance con-
tinued to be provided to agriculture, which was a particularly slowly devel-
oping sector of the ROK economy; 19.2 percent of the total yen loans were
applied to this area. Investment in agriculture is significant for social
development as well as economic development, so this did noc contradict the
general shift in emphasis of Japanese ODA to Korea. Major projects carried
out with compensated assistance include the Seoul subway (7.2 percent of yen
credit), the Taech'ong and Ch'ungju multipurpose dams (7.1 percent), and vari-
ous agricultural projects (19.2 percent).

All of these projects have achieved the results anticipated. But since they
were all the first such construction projects in the ROK, the experience

hl
FOR 0F1ﬂ€1AI.USE(MVLY
gained by ROK civil engineering and construction industries which participated
in then brought about technological advances in those industries similar to
the effects of the Soyang Dam. In particular, the large-scale introduction of
modern construction equipment through ODA led directly to a strengthening of
the international competitiveness of the ROK construction industry. This made
possible an overseas expansion of the construction industry as well as the
autonomous growth of various types of construction businesses within the ROK.
Of course, this was not a direct result of the Japanese ODA. It was a totally
secondary effect. But it is noteworthy in view of the overseas operations of
the Korean construction industry, which has become an important provider of
foreign currency.

Conclusion: The Significance of "$6 Billion of Economic Assistance"

There was dramatic expansion of Korean industries in the 1970's. The present
Korean economy is assessed as having sufficient strength to handle the kinds of
projects, including the technical problems, which were objects of Japanese ODA.
Under the Japanese approcch to ODA, statements were made to the effect that
funds would be provided for separate projects agreed upon, but in reality,
Japan provided the personnel and materials which were needed to carry out the
project and could not be supplied by the recipient country. If the application
of the aid is limited to traditional fields, there is no longer a need for

this type of assistance in the ROK. Therefore, the ODA from all foreign coun-
tries to the ROK is actually decreasing rapidly year by year. and statements
are being heard similar to the one mentioned which was made at the Japan-ROK
periodic ministerial conference. To put it another way. becavse of the re-
sults achieved through ODA to the ROK, it has broken out of the economic devel-
opment stage in which it was a recipient of ODA. The role played by ODA in

the ROK has apparently come to an end.

However, at a meeting of the Japanese and ROK foreign ministers held in
August 1981, after a long period without such meetings, the ROK made a re-
quest to Japan for $6 billion in government loans, to the great surprise of
the Japanese. Besides the large size of the amount, Japan is concerned about
the purpose of the request, support for the RDK defense effort (seturity eco-
nomic assistance). TLe Japanese minister of foreign affairs promptly refused
Luu request. Later, at the Japan-ROK periodic ministerial conference, there
was no progress in bringing the views of the two parties closer, and negotia-
tions are still deadlocked.

As stated earlier, the ROK economy has progressed to the point where it does
not require ODA from Japan as in the past. So why did the ROK suddenly ask
for a huge government loan of $6 billion.

It is well knownthat after 1976 the Korean-economy had begun to lose its
balance because of the overly ambitious promotion of the heavy and chemical
industries. It was then hit hard by the second oil crisis and fell into a
deep recession in the latter part of 1979. Crop failures due to a cold sum-
mer in 1980 added to the difficulty. Effective steps could not be taken be-
cause of a loss of central government power after the assassination of

he
90! OFFICIAL USIZ(MNLY
President Pak, and the recession became worse and worse. As a result, the
growth rate fell to minus 5 or 6 percent, and it is not difficult to imagine
how this hurt the self-confidence of the ROK Government. Looking at the
activity of the ROK economy this year, we find that although there may not be
further retrogression, there is still a high level of inflation and not much
growth in exports. Accumulation of foreign debt seemed to be a part of the
motive power of the economy rather than a burden during the period of high
growth. However, by economic logic, it begins to exert heavy pressure once
the economy stagnates.

Private loans were the main factor in overcoming the ROK's trade deficit in
the past. Even now, it seems to be possible to obtain them without serious
difficulty. However, a flexible interest system for private loans has become
common, and previous advantages (partial elimination of debt by inflation)
have relatiVely diminished. Therefore, the ROK's crisis in international pay-
ments can be temporarily postponed through an infusion of private loans, but
this cannot be a fundamental solution. At the same time, a large increase in
low-interest, long-term government loans cannot be hoped for under conven-
tional ways of thinking. It appears that the ROK has attempted to break out
of a hopeless situation with the new concept of "security economic assistance,‘
or in other words, by creating a new "category of aid."

Whatever we may think of "security economic assis-ance," it is clear that the
present $6 billion problem has its roots in the accumulation of foreign debt
which accompanied Korean economic development. The accumulation of foreign
debt is a worldwide problem today. And Korea did not escape it even though
it was regarded as one of the most outstanding performers among the develop—
ing countries.

The ROK is also complaining about the problem of a trade imbalance with Japan.
Even without raising the example of Taiwan, which has a trade imbalance with
Japan but does not have such a large accumulation of foreign debt, we must
say that it is not appropriate to propose government loans as a solution to
the problem. It is necessary to point out that there is room for further
thought in the ROK's economic policies and development strategies.

Even so, if an extreme trade imbalance is maintained over the long term with
resource-poor countries like the ROK and Taiwan, the result is to place a
burden on the other party. The idea that real economic cooperation comes
through trade rather than aid is especially true for Japan and these semi-
developed countries. We can say that Japan has reached the position where it
must make a conscious effort.

VICE PRESIDENT 01' m DISCUSSES INS srsm
Tokyo SEUKAN BIRION in Japanese 12 Mar 82 pp 20-23

[Text] [Question] Lately, INS, Intonation Network System, has become a topic
of conversation. Yasusada Kitahara is the leader of Nippon Telegraph and Tele-
phone Public Corporation's technology teas: and also an advocate of INS. In the
event of INS conpletion, it is said that a terrific society will come about.
but I can't quite clearly visualize this image. Today, I would like to ask

what kind of impact INS will have on our society, and what is the technology
supporting INS.

[Kitahara] First of all, I wan“. you to understand that Japan is a telephone
society. The accmlated delays in 1978 of not getting a phone soon after
applying has been completely resolved. and all of Japan can call freely.

There are 60 million telephone subscribers in Japan and 60 million telephones.

Japan and the 0.8. together account for more than half of the world's tele-
phones.

On the one hand, Alvin Tofler, who wrote "The Third Wave." and Harvard Univer-
sity's Daniel Bell and others are saying: "In the let century, information
will support national life and information will cause major changes." It is
the so-called post-industrial society. As for whether it was correct to in-
terpret this as a d» -industriaiizeu society or not, at any rate I have asserted
or some time 'hat 1!. is necessary to create an information network system

in such a society. That is, create the network most adapted to information.

Speaking a little more concretely, just as Daniel Bell says, in a high level
information society, 10 percent of infomtion exchanged is by telephone;

90 percent is by means other than the telephone. I an calling "means other
than the telephone" the now-telephone system. The non-telephone system will
steadily increase. It can he said that INS is necessary for this new society.

100.000 Yen Automobile Telephone

[Question] The non-telephone syst- refers to facsimile and data comnication,
doesn‘t it?

Ma
FOR OFFICIAL (BB ONLY
[Kitaharal .Yea, Howeyer. it is absolutely necessary to obtain the understand-
ing of the private sector in order to promote INS, It will he hopeless if

the people say, "Let the telephone company do as it pleases. If the rates

go up, we won‘t use the telephone,“

On this point, I myself have considered how the life of the Japanese would

be affected by INS. I will present the results of this research soon, but

for example, let‘s consider the image of ”peace of mind" in daily life. It
is no more than a tentative assumption, but I think ”peace of mind" is tied
to the categories of medical care and safety.

In terms of medical care. can't INS help with a medical infatuation system
and a medical care data base? I think the Ministry of Health and Welfare
should take the lead in furnishing this. Information on "what to do when

a child has a fever" could be obtained by means of facsimile or cathode ray
tube.

Likewise, in terms of safety, information can be obtained by means of an earth-
quake prediction system and operational safety supervision system. It is my
INS concept that such data bases can be used freely and at moderate prices.

[0nestion7 NTT has designed a diversification nf services and has begun sell-
ing as new products facsimile, automobile telepiones, kanji (Chinese character)
printers and the like. As for such services, tle automobile telephone can be
considered typical, hut the price is high (installation and subscription fee

is more than 80,000 yen; the basic monthly rate is 30,000 yen; and a cost of

10 yen per 6.5 seconds up to 160 kilometers). Wouldn't INS be expensive for
the user? '

[kitahara] Digital technology is the basis for lowering the cost. Ultra-
LSI's are representative of this. By increasing the level of integration,
as from 66 kilobits to 256 kilobits to l megabit, the cost per information
unit will quickly drop.

The automobile telephone is one example. In the beginning, NTT purchased

them at 800,000 yen each. One hundred and some 10's were used. Today. four
years later, connecting from Nagoya costs 480,000 yen; the number of 16's has
decreased to around 70, about half. The size is about one-fourth and of course
power consumption has declined.

I think that a cost of 200,000 to 250,000 yen is possible in about 4 or 5
years, or 1985. A memory of 256 kilobits and 10's with about 1,000 gates will
be used and only about 20 IC‘s will be needed. Moreover, a 100,000 yen auto-
mobile telephone is in the midst of development.

[Question] Thus far. IC‘s have achieved a fourfold cumulative level in two
years. May we see the reality of a 100,000 yen automobile telephone earlier
than expected?

_ 1:5
ma omcm. use om:
3U“ VA'A'AVW HUB VJ!“

[kitahara] 256 kilohita is at the stage. of train realized. As for whether
the. 100,000 yen automobile telephone can sort on existing extension lines,
a considerable Breakthrough may be necessary.

Optical Cos-unicetion, Decisive Tactor in Lower Costs
[Question] Will digitalization lower costs for all telecomnications?

[Kitahara] um. digitalisation, switchboards and computers will be 30-50
percent cheaper. The same will be true for transmission ayateas. That alone
can reduce invesuaent costs for microwave. coaxial cable and repeaters.

Optical communication will clinch this even more. At present, microwave needs
a repeater placed every 50 kilometers. Then less than 3,000 people in total
can comnicate siuultaneoualy. Shifting to coaxial cable, it because possi-
ble for just under 6,000 people to comnicate simltaneously. But an ampli-
fier has to he installed every 1.5 kilometers along the route. Recently. a
bridge in excess of 2 kilometers is not unusual. and amplifiers are attached
along the bridge. There are problm with reliability because of swinging.

With optic fibers, an amplifier my be spaced 20 kilometers. Moreover, what
is unusual about optics is that 26,000 people, a fourfold increase, can con-
municate simltaneously. That is because mny channels are possible if the
fibers are pure and uncontaminated. You may think of this in the same way
that Mt. Fuji can he seen well on a clear day.

[Question] This means the cost per circuit will drop, doesn't it?

[Kitahara] Optical communication may be called the decisive factor resolving
the infamous distance differential. At 60 to 1. it can be called the great-
est differential in the world, and that bitter pill is accepted with resigna-
tion. I think that if optical communication becomes widespread, this differ-
ence will be reduced to almost zero. If it isn't reduced to zero, then INS
itself won't materialize. It is a contradiction for a person living in Tokyo
to pay a moderate rate while the person living in the provinces has to pay
an extra rate to NT“ in order to outain the sane information.

(Question? Here your concept of "information quantity-levied rate" has ap-
peared, hasn't it?

[Kitahara] I presented the "information quantity-levied rate" concept in
September last year and as having it researched by many peopel. In a word,
the cost of sending information by using an information highway will be de-
termined by the intonation sent. Given that information quantity equals
transmission speed times use time, the faster the speed, the more the quantity
of information which. can he sent in one second. how much information can be
sent in one second, the hand, is similar to the concept of how such of the
width of the road is used.

[Question] _nnt at present, it is said that when there is digitalization, the
human voice will be sent at GA kilobits‘ 'It so, it seems that the cost will

be extremely expensiVe.

[Ritahara] Sending the human voice at 65 kilobits‘means, in digitalization,
delimiting one second into 8,000 and furthermore arranging that into 8 steps
in order to discern the voice perfectly. Since 66 kilobits is too extravagant.
we are researching whether 32 kilobits or 16'kilobits won‘t work.

Since verbal response does not require voice quality, even 8 kilobits is extra-
vagant. Certainly, when the idea of "information quantity-levied rate" is pro-
moted on the assumption of 64 Rilobits. the rate will be extremely high. That
is why we are reexamining whether 66 kilobits is right or not. We intend to

run various trails from 66 kilobits to 16 kilobits in 3 tests beginning in
FY1982.

Moderately Priced Terminal Equipment Prom Private Sector

[Question] In each home , the telephone, of course, microcomputer, facsimile
and cathode ray tube will be connected to one telephone line, won't they?

[kitshara] It is not possible with copper wire but with fiber optics it is
possible to tie them into one telephone line.

[Question] In that case, will acoustic couplers which convert analogs into
digital become unnecessary?

[kitshara] Basically they won't be needed. Stnce the human voice is an ana-
log, it is necessary to convert it into digital. The CODBC converter is one
kind of IC. It now costs about 8,000 yen, but perhaps it will decrease to
about 2,000 yen. There is no problem with a digital and analog junction if
it is built into the telephone.

[busstion] Conversely, since the coupler is expensive, INS won't progress
as long as the coupler is necessary, will it?

[kitshara] Reducing the price of the terminal as much as possible may be
said to be the fundamental condition for INS.

[huescionl How far will NTT go?

[kitahsra] It is a fundamental principle of ours to entrust all terminals

to the private sector. NTT furnished the network. but my idea is that NTT
will offer a common network and furnish a two-stage entry so as to be able

to create an independent network for. industrial use where the connection is
simple and there are experts.

Take the facsimile as an example. Perhaps there will be someone who says,
"transmitting by facsimile is great, but I may use-many incorrect characters
and phonetic equivalents. Since I don‘t.wmnt to be teased, I'll do it by
telephone.‘

with an adapter attached to the tube.

sification of services. Certainly the price must'drop with mass production.
The purpose in asking Sony Corporation and Toshiba Corporation to participate
is to try to lower the price of'peraonal use CRT’s. We have having Nippon
Electric Company, Ltd., Fujitsu. Ltd., and Hitachi, Ltd. research an adapter
which can be attached to the present television tube.

Successive Advent of New Fiber Materials
[Question] By the way. is there no use for man-made satellites in INS?

[Kitahsra] or course, it is necessary to build s communications net with sat-
ellites. Weather satellites are already large enough at present. but it will
be necessary for broadcasting satellites and communication satellites to be
larger. The satellite Japn will launch next year will weigh 350 kilograms,
have a life span of 5 years and a capacity of 3.000 circuits.

America has already launched a one ton satellite. Its life span is 10 years
and it has a capacity of 25,000 circuits. This difference is due to the dif-
ference in rockets. This is unofficial, but it is being said that America
may launch Japan’s comunication satellite with the space shuttle. Columbia.
It is said it can be done at roughly one-sixth the cost.

[Question] In terms of materials, will there be any new materials coming
out?

[Kitshara] Gallium arsenide and Josephson's element are the new theoretical
ones. but they cannot be used easily except in very low tenperatures. Con-
cerning semiconductor elements, I think for the time being we will go with
today's silicon technology. However concerning optical fibers, I think that
fibers with an extremely high degree of transparency will appear by using
such new materials as tlourine. As I mentioned previously, a 20 kilometer
transmission without a repeater is possible, but this will become incomen-
surable. For example, a 5,000 kilometer transmission without a repeater
would be possible. I! so. trananiasion i'rom Tokyo to Hawaii will be possible
without a repeater.

[Question7 If so, will the laser output have to be increased?

[Kitaharg] No. Since it will go far naturally if the fiber’s transparency
increases. I think it can be done with a normal semiconductor laser. At

MITSUBISHI. CHRYSLER to START JOINT PRODUCTION
MIT! Minister's Request
Tokyo NIKON KEIZAI SEIMBUN in Japanese 24 Feb 82 p 1

[Text]

ITI MiniSter ABE on the 23rd reported to Mitsubishi Motors Board
Chairman Tomio KUBO that the US Government is showing strong interest
in the re-construction of Chrysler, which is suffering from financial
difficulty, and virtually requested the said company to co-operate in the
re-construction of Chrysler. At his talks with USTR BROCK in January.
ITI Minister ABE expressed the Japanese Government's intention of giving in-
direct supportforthe re-construction of Chrysler. His request that day
is due to the judgment that the Japanese Government should help improve
Japan-US relations in which trade friction is intensifying, by urging
:itsubishi Motors to relieve Chrysler.from the standpoint of Japan-US
industrial co-operation. In response to this, Board Chairman KUBO clarified
the intention of tackling support in the fields of joint production of

automobiles of new models and technological co-operation, in a forward-
looking way.

ITI Minister ABE invited Board ‘hairman KUBO to a hotel in Tokyo on
the morning of the 23rd. and held talks with him for about “5 minutes. At
‘ u :alks, the 1?i Minister stated that "when I held talks with Representative
BRCCK on my visit to the US in January. I realized that the US Government
is deeply worried about Chysler's financial difficulty, and at the same time
has Strong interest in the re-construction of that company." So saying, he
conveyed the US Government's intention to Board Chairman KUBO. In response to
this, Board Chairman KUBO showed a positive posture toward support for Chrysler,
and also explained in detail the development to date, including the tie-up
relationship between Mitsubishi Motors and Chrysler.

From the middle of January, MIT! started studies on concrete measures to
relieve Chrysler on the basis of the request by the US Government. The main
points of the measures include: (1) Opening a way for Export-Import Bank
loans for the re-construction of Chrysler, through Mitsubishi Motors which

has tie-up relations with Chrysler; (2) urging Mitsubishi Motors to purchase
Mitsubishi Motors' shares held by Chrysler and granting loans, with these

52
FOI:OIWWCJAI.USI20NIY
shares as security; and (3) promoting joint production of automobiles of
new models by Mitsubishi Motors and its technological co-operation, for the
recovery of Chrysler's competitive power in the US.

The Mitsubishi Motors side already announced the policy of "purchasing
Mitsubishi Mot ors' shares held by Chrysler, at any time, if formally requested
by Chrysler." As it showed, at the talks that day, its positive posture
toward support in the fields of joint development of automobiles of new models
and technological co-operation, the probability has become strong that
MitSubishi Motors' relief of Chrysler will materialize with the support of
the Governments of Japan and the US.

For such reasons as the sluggishness of. demand for its automobiles in the

US and the delay in rationalization, Chrysler still had a deficit of $400
million in the current account for 1981, though it showed improvement compared
with the deficit of $1.800 million in the preceding year, and it is having
difficulty in raisin: funds, too. Therefore, it is doing its utmost for
the re- construction of its management, by such means as selling its tank sector
to General Dynamics, which is a major company in the US munitions industry,
at the price of about $350 million.

starting of Preliminary Surveys
Tbkyo NIRON IBIZA! SHIMBUN in Japanese 26 Fob 82 p 7

[Text]

Mitsubishi Motors clarified on the 25th that it had informally notified
the Chrysler side of its intention to start preliminary surveys to produce
Mitsubishi automobiles jointly with Chrysler in the US in the future.

It is said that studies will be started on the following matters on the
administrative level between the two companies within two or three months:
(1) The trends of the small-car market in the US in 198“ and 1985; and

(2) what models are suited for joint production in view of the balance of
commodity plans between the two companies during the next several years.
MitsubishiMotorshas so far taken the stand that (joint production) is
premised on Chrysler's producing certain results as to improvement of
productivity, quality control, etc. It explains that it has decided to start
preliminary surveys for joint production, in parallel with its co-operation
for the rationalization of Chrysler, because a period of about two years is
required for preparations in order to carry out joint production. however,
it is presumed that the said company also considered the fact that the US
Government requested Mitsubishi Motors, through MITI, to co-operate in

the re-construction of Chrysler.

At its top-level talks with Chrysler in September last year, Mitsubishi
Motors had the Chrysler side approve sales of Mitsubishi automobiles
through Mitsubishi's own sales networks in the US. At the same time.
agreement was reached on the following points as to new tie-up relations
between the two companies: (1) Technological co-operation will be pushed

of productivity; and (2) joint production will be checked into after this

has produced certain results. In response to this, Chrysler dispatched
project teams on production technology, purchase control, and development of
new cars to Japan in the fall of last year, and started exchange of technology
with the Hitubishi side. The two companies will soon conclude a formal.
comprehensive contract for the furnishing of technology, and Mitsubishi is
scheduled to extend reimbursible technological co-operation on a full scale

as to individual themes.

Recently, however, the Chrysler side made the followingproposalthrough
part-time Director R. A. PERKINS: "we want to start concrete studies on
joint production, without delay." It is thought that behind this, there
are circumstances where sales of Chrysler's small cars, such as Omni's and
Horizon's.donot increase, on the one hand, while on the other, it wants to
reduce the burden of development of new cars, requiring a huge amount of money.
in addition to conducting various kinds of rationalization.

As to this. the Mitsubishi side maintained the stand of being unable
to start concrete studies on joint production immediately, but agreed on
preliminary surveys, saying that a certain period for preparations is required
for joint production, even in the light of the tie-up between Honda Giken
and B; of Britain, and that the start of actual production will be delayed
greatly if it waits until the rationalization by Chrysler comes to the end
of the chapter.

0n the part of Mitubishi, there is the circumstance that its sales in
the US do not amount to more than about 30,000 cars annually under the
self-imposed restrictions on exports to the US, and that it is unable to in-
crease sales greatly. From medium- and long-range points of view, too.
there is the judgment that it is difficult to increase the export of
finished cars to the US, and that it cannot but decide on production in the

US in some form or other, sooner or later.
For the present, it will start preliminary surveys centering on the
nurket trends around the year 199". edicting that joint production will be
' r. a:;und that - r at the earliest. A Mitsubishi leader says that
"Tne two companies will carry out surveys separately, and they will carry ut
joint surveys, toc, depending upon problems."

EAST 'OPPENSWDWSIVE BATTLE' OVER convmm REACTOR
Tokyo SHDXAN TOYO KEIZAI in Japanese 14 Nov 81 pp 11-16
[Article by Hasakuni Unezawa]

[Text]

-- The Japan-US negotiations on reprocessing have ended in
failure. As a result, the significance of the advanced
thermal converter reactor (ATR) has increased suddenly.
However, a heated controversy is going \n between HITI
and the nine electric power companies o’er the organiza-
tion to develop a proven ATR and the sharing of expenses. --

The greater the expectation, the greater the discouragement, when
the expectation is not met. This was just the case with the Japan-US
negotiations held on reprocessing four years ago. The recent negotia-
tions on reprocessing, too, have turned out to be such a case.

According to the "Japan-US Agreement and Joint Communique Concerning
the Reprocessing Problem" released in Japan and in the US simultaneously
on October 31, the US "lifted the ban" on the preparatory work for the
construction of a second reprocessing plant in Japan. which work it did
not approve four years ago. However, the period for the operation of the
Tokai Reprocessing Facility was still limited to three years. Also, the
US side did not say a single word about re-cycling of plutonium obtained
from light—water reactors, which re-cycling had been strongly desired by
Japan.

True, this Joint Communique contains, in its last part, the state-
ment that "For a 'permanent solution,‘ an arrangement, which is accepta-
ble to both parties, will be made prior to the end of 198u." In accord-
ance with this statement, the Foreign Ministry wants to "start consulta-
tions as early as at the beginning of next year" (Atomic Energy Division
of the United Nations Bureau). In reality, however, it is likely to be
true that "It will be difficult to expect a package solution in three
years hence" (Research and International Co-operation Division of the
Science and Technology Agency).

55
FOR OFFKJA1.U§E(MWLY
The allowable limit for reprocessing at Tokai, which limit previously
was fixed at 99 tons a year, has been raised to 210 tons, or an amount
equal to the present capacity of the Tokai Reprocessing Facility. This
"expansion," however, does not have any practical significance. because

the Tokai Reprocessing Facility is operating, as a matter of fact, only at
the level of 60 tons a year.

The actual situation, therefore, is far from Japan's original goal,
which was to gain the "right of self-determination" in regard to
reprocessing. The unstable position of Japan, whose reprocessing enter-
prise is subject to the "life-and-death power" of the US according to

Paragraph C. Article 8 of the Japan-US Atomic Energy Agreement, has not
undergone any fundamental change.

Shock Dealt by Bombing of Iragi Atomic Reactor

Kumao KANEKO, who is Director of the Atomic Energy Division of the
United Nations Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, leaped to his feet. when
he read the Joint Communique of the SUZUKI-.FAGAN Summit Conference held
in May this year. Paragraph lu of this Joint Communique went as follows:
"The President endorsed the view of the Prime Minister that reprocessing
is of particular importance to Japan. The Prime Minister and the Presi-
dent agreed that the two Governments should promptly start consultations
with a view to working out a permanent solution at an early date." This
Statement was exactly the same as that contained in the draft prepared
by the Foreign Ministry. 'President REAGAN affixed his seal to the draft
;~ :. indlv.

Director KANEKO thought that President REAGAM is still different from
former President CARTER who was rather stoically devoted to the policy of
preventing nuclear proliferation, with the "withdrawal of plutonium, indefi-
nite suspension of commercial reprocessing and suspension of the development
of the fast breeder reactor (FBR)" as a slogan, and that Japan can now make
a dash for a "permanent solution." It is no wonder that he chuckled to
himself over this thought.

 

However, the situation changed suddenly on June 7, when the Israeli
Air Force bombed an atomic reactor in Iraqi territory. Iraq is a signatory
to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and has accepted inspection
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Such an attack on this
country was a demonstration of distrust toward the present system for the
prevention of nuclear proliferation by Israel.

President REAGAN, who was greatly shocked by this incident, hastily
rewrote his external atomic energy policy (policy of preventing nuclear
proliferation), which he had promised to announce prior to the Ottawa
Summit. By the new policy he announced on July 16. he confirmed again
that “The prevention of nuclear proliferation is a supra-partisan pledge
of the US." He also proposed the acceleration of the participation in
the NPT by the nations not yet affiliated with this treaty, strengthening

56
FINI¢NNHC1A1.IHNE(NVLY
of the IAEA and the application of the IAEA's'safeguirds-to all nuclear'
activities of the countries not in possession of nuclear weapons.
President REAGAN thus started efforts to strengthen again the nuclear
non-proliferation system led by the US.

Nevertheless, Japan remained optimistic. The reason is that the US
President mentioned in his statement as follows: "The US will not ban or
check reprocessing or the development of the FBR by private circles in
those countries where there are advanced atomic energy programs and where
there are no risks of nuclear proliferation." Japan thought that it
doubtlessly is one of such countries.

However, the Japanese mission, which flew to Washington in late July
to materialize the "permanent solution" promised by the Japan-US Joint
Communique, was disgusted at the fact that the US side was not willing at
all to start negotiations. The US side only reiterated that "The details
of the nuclear non-proliferation policy have not yet been completed."
when the Japanese side insisted on Japan‘s "right as a nation with an
advanced program," the US side looked displeased, and asked, "Then, how
does Japan think such countries as India and Pakistan should be treated?".
In short, the US holds that the prevention of nuclear proliferation should
be given priority over all the “rights of nations." As far as this .
position is concerned, there has been no change at all since the days of
the CARTER Administration. Such being the situation, we must say that it
was an important success of this Japanese mission that a promise to
"continue consultations" was secured, at any rate. from the us side.

However, the world is as kind as it is cruel. It is the advanced
thermal converter reactor (ATR) which suddenly began to attract attention,
"thanks to" the failure of the negotiations on reprocessing.

ATR Suddenly Comes to Surface (?)

The ATR is a genuinely indigenous Ptomic reactor which has been developed
by Donen (Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation) as an "inter-
mediate reactor," that is, a reactor which is intermediate between the light-
water reactor and the fast breeder reactor (FER). While the light-water
reactor burns enriched uranium with the use of light water (ordinary water) as
moderator, the ATR uses heavy water as moderator, and can burn plutonium and
depleted uranium which are collected by the reprocessing of the fuel used by
the light-water reacvor. Already in 1979, a prototype reactor, "Fugen," went

into operation. No other atomic reactor has so turbulent a career or has been
subjected to so various criticisms as the ATR.

From the beginning, electric power industry circles have been indiffer-
ent toward the "intermediate reactor" called the ATR, because they hold that

"We have no time to play loose, because we must advance directly from
the light-water reactor to the FER" (leader of an electric power company).
In 1978, MIT! and the electric power companies and Electric Power Development

57
F!Nl(ﬂlﬂ(1A1.US£10Nll
Company, which are under HITI's direct jurisdiction, decided to induct the
CANDU-type reactor (heavy-water reactor of the Canadian type), which, like
the ATR, is a heavy-water reactor. It is still fresh in our memory that a
fierce controversy occurred between MITI and these companies,on the one hand,
and the Atomic Energy Commission and the Science and Technology Agency, which
thought that this decision is a "plot to squash the ATR," on the other.

The confrontation between the federation of Donen and the Science and
Technology Agency, which were to take charge of the development of the ATR,
and the federation of electric paler companies and H111, which maintained
an indifferent attitude, was brought into the Atomic Energy Commission's
department of experts (department of experts for appraisal and study of
proven reactors), which department was to determine whether to build a proven
ATR as a step following the construction of a prototype reactor, "Fugen."

The report, which was drawn up in July this year, or after the lapse
of four months from the establishment of a drafting committee, revealed
the conclusion that "It is proper to build a proven reactor with an output
of 600,000 kilowatts." In many respects, this report reflects the fierce
controversies that took place at the meetings of the committee.

For instance, the report contains the following statement: "It is
desirable, at present, to push the development of the ATR by Government-
private co-operationsothat the ATR can be incorporated into the system
of atomic power generation, although the date for the starting of the
practical use of the FBR and the use of plutonium for light-water reactors
must be taken into consideration." It can be seen that this statement
left room for a change in the future, by reducing the precondition in the
original draft to mere "consideration" and inserting the words "at present."

.is is typical of what is called the weasel-worded statement.

Also, the draft, which was prepared by the Science and Technology
Agency, contained a statement calling for "Government-private co-operation."
The electric power companies, however, forcibly changed this statement to
one calling for "devclopment by 3; .rnment-people co-operation.“ Similarly,

.. ;;atenent that ”.. is desirable to substitute the ATR for 25 per cent of
the planned light-water reactors," which statement was contained in the
original draft, was simply deleted.

"We Co-operatedz But ..."

the electric power companies frown upon the ATR, because this reactor
does not pay well. ”This reactor, which is called the advanced thermal
reactor (ATR), is not advanced, as far as the burning rate is concerned.
The electric power companies cannot take a cool attitude, because they

helped FS. How should we meet such a situation?" (Chairman Toshio ITO of
Atomic Power Generation).

It is expected that the cost of generating electric power by the
first proven ATR in its first year of operation will be twice that in

58
ron OFFICIAL use ONLY
the case of generation by a light-water reactor, and that the average
cost in 16 years will be stabilized at a level 30 per cent higher than
the same. However, the conversion ratio of the ATR is 0.7, or about

the same as that of the light-water reactor which is 0.6. Moreover.

the development of the am is still at a stage, where it is being planned
to build a proven reactor with an output of 600,000 kilowatts, while the
light-water reactor is entering a period, in which its output will be
increased to 1,300,000 kilowatts. The site efficiency, therefore, is
very poor. "It is said that the cost of generating electric power by the
MR (average cost in 16 years) will be about the same as that of thermal
power generation using coal. however, the problem of location, which must
be solved for atomic power generation, is entirely different from that in
the case of thermal power generation, although the situation may change,
if it becomes possible to build many atomic power plants easily."

Even the electric power companies, however, cannot but admit that
the "significance of the existence" of the ATR has increased, since the
Japan-US Joint Communque concerning reprocessing was issued in October.
They are contemplating the plu-thermal formula (burning of plutonium in
a light-water reactor) as a temporary method to make use of plutonium
until the PBR is put into practical use. In the recent Japan-US nego-
tiations on reprocessing, however, the US side ignored Japan's desire
to put the plu-thermal formula on a commercial 1‘ xsis. It said peremptorily
as follows: "We do not have any plan concerning the plu-thermal formula.
So, we do not want to be asked any further about it."

It is no wonder that the US side took such an attitude. Approval of
the plu-thermal formula means the recognition of the right to make use of
plutonium to all the countries which have light-water reactors. In such
an event, there can be no prevention of nuclear proliferation.

0n the other hand, the ATR is an indigenous reactor developed by
Japan independently, and "Even the US recognizes that the comercial
use of plutonium by means of this reactor does not involve any problem"
(Science and Technology Agency). If so, the only way for Japan to make
use of plutonium is to burn plutonium by the use of the ATR, and expand
its right of reprocessing by the accumulation of such accomplished facts.
"The ATR can be used. at any rate, as a kind of insurance, though not in
a positive way" (Vice-President Ichiro 110111 of Tokyo Electric Power).

Total Bar between HUI-Electric Power Develomgnt Alliance and Electric
Power Com es

The actual situation, however, does not permit at all the starting
of the construction of a proven HR at once. Three months have already
passed since the Atomic Energy Commission's department of experts
presented its report. No agreement has been reached until now, however,
on the problems of top importance, such as the designation of an organi-

zation to take charge of the construction and the sharing of the expenses
by private circles.

59
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
A who we a shares: vet. vats-e

For the designation of the organization to take charge of the
construction, it can be proposed to select one of the nine electric
power companies, Electric Power Development or Atomic Power Generation,
or establish a new, semi-governmental organization. The nine electric
power companies, however, are not inclined at all to build a proven
reactor themselves. Also, the prospect for the establishment of a new.
semi-governmental organization is dim, at this time when the Government
is going to carry out an administrative reform.

Atomic Power Generation is not prepared at all to take upon itself
the task of building an ATR, because the first reactor at its Tsuruga
Plant has juSt been involved in an accident, and because it has already
been preoccupied with the task of supervising the construction of a
prototype PBR, "Honju," and making preparations for the construction of
a second reactor in Tsuruga.

Electric Power Development, which is the only remaining candidate,
sent 50 technological experts to the site of construction of "Eugen," a
prototype ATR. Even at present, it keeps a little more than ten experts
at the site, for the operation of this reactor. Also, the basic position, _
which is maintained by leaders of Electric Power Development, is as follows:
"This company is a national policy company. So, it cannot but do whatever
is ordered by the State after the establishment of necessary conditions."
It is clear, from both the objective and subjective points of view, that
Electric Power Development is the only organization that can take charge of
the construction of the ATR.

Over the question to which there is only one answer, however, a fierce
controversy is going on between HITI and the electric power companies.

Atomic Power -- Sincere Desire of Electric Power Development

MIT! wants to give atomic power to Electric Power Development, which
is under its direct jurisdiction. b" all means. As a matter of fact,
Electric Power Deve103mcnt has harbored a cherished desire to advance into
the field of alumic power generation, for a long time since it went into a
dispute with Atomic Power Generation over a gas cooling reactor. For the
realization of this sincere desire, MIT! and Electric Power Development
exerted all efforts to introduce a CANDU-type reactor. At the last moment,
however, they were prevented from doing so by the Atomic Energy Commission
and the Science and Technology Agency.

MITI and Electric Power Development have not yet formally given up
hope for the CANDU-type reactor. In the skeleton budget plan they
presented for fiscal 1982, they earmarked a sum of ¥2.l billion for
overvall technological assessment. The environment around the CANDU—type
reactor, however, has become quite different from that in 1978.

The CANDU-type reactor can burn natural uranium directly, and Canada
guarantees a stabilized uranium supply to the purchaser of this reactor.

60
FOR‘OFFTCJAL.1EHECMWLY
So, this reactor has been advertized as a reactor which will enable its
user to decrease the dependence on the uranium-enriching capacity of the
US, and at the same time, escape from the burden to be imposed by the rise
in uranium prices. The world now sees, however, an oversupply of enriched
uranium due to the expansion of equipment by URENKO of West

Germany and Eurodif (TN: phonetic) of France. Also, a prospect has been
established for the securing of enough uranium resources to meet demand
until the year 2020. In brief, thereare no longer any convincing grounds
for arguing for the introduction of the CANDU—type reactor.

Then, Electric Power Development has no choice but to grasp the ATR,
if it wants to advance into the field of atomic power generation. ﬂore-
over, the possession of the ATR, which is a national policy reactor, will
give Electric Power Development an excellent excuse for containing the
attack to be directed against this special corporation as an object of
administrative reform. Then, the four posts within this company (poet of
President and three posts of Director), which posts are available for the
retired ITI Vice-Hinistersand MIT! bureau directors-general, will remain
safe.

On the other hand, it is clear that the possession of the ATR, which
costs #300 billion to ¥u00 billion in the case 0: a proven reactor and the
operation of which on a paying basis is in doubt. is a very risky adventure
for HITI. As a matter of fact, an uneasy feeling has been revealed, in
whispers, within MITI as to "whether it is safe to entrust this reactor to
the superannuated technicians of Electric Power Development who do not have
experience in handling commercial reactors."

For the reduction of the big risks, a forcible step must be taken to
"involve" the private electric power compnaies in this undertaking. "We
do not permit the private electric power companies to take the attitude of
an onlooker toward construction of a proven reactor by Electric Power
Development. They will be asked to provide most of the funds necessary
for this project. Perhaps they must contribute two-thirds or even more.
Furthermore, it is useless to develop the ATR, unless this reactor is to
be used as a commercial reactor in the future. The electric power
companies, therefore, must give the commitment that they, too, will use
this reactor in the future" (Atomic Power Generation Division of the
Resources and Energy Agency).

"Last Resistance" by Electric Power Companies

True, the economical character of the ATR will improve, if the use of
this reactor by private electric power companies in the future is promised.
These companies, however, will not give such a commitment in any way, unless
it is proved that the capacity of this reactor can be expanded and that the
cost of generating electric power by this reactor can be reduced to the
level in the case of power generation by light-water reactors. "We think
that the department of experts certainly produced an agreement on the
construction of only one proven reactor. th is such a problem taken up

61

I U“ V. I I‘vll‘l- U¢fn UI‘I‘I

now?" (leader of an electric power company). -

0n the part of the nine electric power companies, there is still a
latent but strong crisis-feeling that the possession of atomic power by
HITI and Electric Power Development in advance will open a way for
administrative authorities to launch "aggression" on private circles.
At the time of the dispute over the CANDU-type reactor in 1978, Chairman
Gaishi HIRAIHA of the Federation of Electric Power Companies stated that
"It may be good to build one or two test reactors." This statement
created the general impression that the electric power companies permitted
Electric Power Development to start atomic power generation. However, it
is said as follows: "That statement only reflected the view prevailing at
that time. The way of thinking is always changing. A conclusion has not
yet been reached at the conference of Presidents (on whether to permit.
Electric Power Development to have atomic power)" (leader of an electric
power company). The nine electric power companies are offering silent
resistance against the ATR, including the problem of sharing the expenses
for the construction of this reactor.

It can be thought that the present policy of the nine electric
companies is to keep HITI irritated, and wait until HITI offers a
compnomise as bait. As a matter of fact. the ATR is not the only
expensive item related to the development of atomic energy. The
Government and private circles are confronting each other over the
sharing of the expenses for the construction of a second reprocessing
plant and that of a uranium-enriching plant as well. Also, it is a
big problem how to meet the cost of scrapping light-water reactors.
The nine electric power companies want to step up the multilateral
:o-ordination of opinions on the sharing of these expenses, with the
ATR as hostage. There are also indications that these companies are
planning to secure the release of the shares of Electric Power Development

to private circles, in return for the transfer of the proven ATR to
Electric Power Development.

Acting Chairman Takashi EUKAIsO of the Atomic Energy Commission
.ays that "He .9 man: to clarify, in the long-term plan for the study,
development and use of atomic energy, which plan is in the making at
present, and what organization should take chargeofthe construction of
the proven ATR." If this policy is to be followed, the present problem
will come to a settlement, in some form or other, by the end of this
year or the end of the present fiscal year.

Until such a time, "negotiations" will be continued beneath the
surface. As consumers, however. we must make it clear that we cannot
permit the expenses for the development of atomic energy. including the
proven ATR, to be met by the raising of electricity rates. as a result
of a "compromise" between MITI and the nine electric power companies.

Tokyo NIKON KEZAI SHIHBUN in Japanese 18 Peb 82 p 4

[Text]

The space treazics, which provide for such steps as payment of compen-
sation to the victims of fallen artificial satellites, have been kept on
the shelf due to the "jurisdictional dispute" among the Ministries concerned.
These treaties have remained unratified for nearly ten years. So, there is
the possibility that the victims of fallen sateliites htJapan\uillbe compelled
to bear silently. Also, the satellites launched by Japan are "unregistered
satellites" in the eyes of the treaty. Japan occupies third place in the
world, though far behind the US and the Soviet Union, as a country active in
outer space. Among other nations, there is the growing criticism that "Japan
is unco-operative and irresponsible in the field of space activities." The
Foreign Ministry has decided that "The international confidence in Japan will
be damaged, if such a situation is left as it is," and has firmed up its plan
to urge other Ministries concerned strongly to hurry the co-ordination of
views for the early ratification of the space treaties.

The space treaties provide for the concrete rights and duties of nations,
international regulations and procedures, on the basis of the "Outer Space
Treaty" (took effect in 1967) whichlaiddowntheprinciplesforthegmacefuluse
of space, including the ban on the launching of weapons of mass destruction
into outer space. They consist of the following two treaties and one agree-
ment: (1) The "Agreement on Rescue and Return" (took effect in 1968), which
provides for the obligation to rescue or return astronauts or objects launched
into outer space; (2) The "Damage Compensation Treaty" (took effect in 1972).
which provides for the responsibility of nations to pay compensation for the
damage done by fallen satellites; and (3) the "Registration Treaty" (took
effect in 1976) which provides for such matters as compulsory registration of
satellites. Japan has ratified the "Outer Space Treaty," but not yet the two
treaties and one agreement which have essential importance. Most of the
principal nations of the world, including Europe, the US and the Soviet Union,
have already joined these treaties and agreement. Especially. the "Damage
Compensation Treaty" has been ratified by more than 70 nations.

0f the two treaties and one agreement, the “Damage Compensation Treaty"
has direct bearing upon the people. If an object launched into outer space,

63
ron omcm. use ONLY
I'UK UPIILIAL 03". URL!

such as the wreckage of an artificial satellite or rocket. falls to earth and
causes damage, the country, which launched that object, must unconditionally
bear the reapensibility to compensate for the damage. Japan, however, is not
yet affiliated with thie Treaty. So, a Japanese victim has no alternative but
to file a suit with the law court of the launching country as an individual.
“In reality, there is the big possibility‘that the victim will be compelled to

accept the incident as his Fate“ (Foreign Ministry source).

Until now, the Soviet Union has launched 1,500 artificial satellites
into outer space, the US —- 900, and Japan -- 22. Including the fragments
of rockets, the total number exceeds 10,000. Host of the objects launched
into outer space are exhausted and burn up before thpy enter the atmosphere
again. In some cases, however, these objects fall to the earth. It was in
January, 1978 that an atomic energy satellite, which had been launched by
the Soviet Union, fell in northern Canada. This incident shocked the whole
world. In recent years. both the US and the Soviet Union have launched
many reconnaissance satellites. The reconnaissance satellites, which are
heavy and fly at a low altitude, do not burn themselves out easily.

Japan is unable to ratify the space treaties, because the revision of
the related internal laws has been hindered by the "friction" among the
Ministries and Agencies concerned. In 1979, the Science and Technology
Agency drew up the outline of a "bill concerning compensation for the damage

done by spacecraft, etc.," clarifying such ideas as follows: (i) if a
satellite launched by Japan causes damage to other countries, the

launcher must bear no-fault liability for compensation, and the State

has a right to indemnity; and (2) the launcher is subject to State-
imposed controls. MITI, however, asked the Science and Technology

Agency to "wait," saying that "Space development, which is an industry

to be developed hereafter, should not be planned by the Science and
Technology Agency alone." The Postal Services Ministry contended that
"Communications satellites are under our jurisdiction." The Meteorological
Agency said that "We are concerned with meteorological satellites." The
Transportation Ministry said that "“;- position must be considered,
because the US that» huttln is a future vehicle." The Education Ministry
ubhdd "In what way will the scientific satellites of the Space Research
Institute of Tokyo University be treated?". As a result, the bill drawn
up by the Science and Technology Agency "disintegrated in the air." The
Science and Technology Agency, which is an "aggregation" of officials from
the outside, was shaken by the unexpected "intervention" from other
Einistries and Agencies. Recently, it has become somewhat bearish,
because there is the view that "It can scarcely occur that Japanese
satellites flying at a high altitude will fall to the earth."

Both the Lower and Upper Houses of the Diet passed resolutions
calling for the early ratification of the space treaties in February and
March, respectively, 1978. Also, the Space Development Committee, which
is the Prime Minister's advisory organ, expressed hope for early
ratification in July, 1977, saying that this step "is necessary and
profitable for the smooth acceleration of space development by Japan."

Among those concerned with space development, there is strong criticism
against the posture of the Government, which they say "is frowned upon
internationally." The Foreign Ministry has revealed its intention to
hurry the co-ordination of views, saying as follows: "It may be impossible
to have the treaties ratified in the present Diet session. However, the
image of Japan among other nations will worsen, unless this task is
carried out by next year's Diet session, at the latest."

[18 Feb 82 p 3]

[Text]

 

Postal Services Ministry Tele-Communications Policy Bureau Director
General HORIZUHI held a press conference on the 17th, and stated

as follows on the problem of liberalizing data communications: "In
regard to the revising of the Public Tele-Oomunications Law this time,
private information and communications enterprise operators will not

be permitted to offer high-level information and communications services
(VAN)." So saying, he clarified the outlook that the contents of the
proposed liberalization of data communications will be limited to
fields excluding high-level information and communications services,
for the time being. Therefore, the possibility has also appeared that
the overall opening of the market for data communications, as sought by
information and communications business circles and the economic and
industrial circles, will be delayed on a large scale.

In connection with the problem of liberalizing data communications,
the Government-LOP side has alrea' :ecided on a policy to incorporate a
revised Public Tale-Communications Law in a "package bill concerning
the re-adjustment or rationalization of [projects which require]
permission or approval," instead of enacting a new law. At the press
conference held on that day, HORIZUHI also said, "The actual situation
is such that this time, the enactment of a new law (as called for by
the Postal Services Ministry) has become difficult." Thus, he formally
expressed his intention to give up submitting a new data-communications

bill (bill concerning added-value data transmission services) to the
current Diet session.

However, the Postal Services Ministry says, 'ﬁhe preconditions
(including the preservation of communications secrets) for the
liberalizing of high-level information and communications services as to
private information and communications enterprise operators have still not
been established (through negotiations with HITI)" (Bureau Director

66
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
General HORIZUHI). Thus, the Ministry plans not to include-the
liberalization of high-level information and communications services
(added-value data transmission services) in the Public Tele-Communications
Law Revision Bill, thong! it had decided to do that.

As for the revising of the Law this time, the proposed liberalization
will be limited (1) to "joint use" of commieations circuits by two
or more companies, and (2) to "use by others." in-which private
communications enterprise operators will lease comunications circuits
from the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation and sub-lease
them to other enterprises, and which will not be accompanied by any
message exchange (meaning the transmitting of information as is.
without changing the contents thereof, as in the case of the telephone).
mis means that approval will virtually not be granted to the
liberalization of message exchange, which liberalization will be
indispensable for private information and communications enterprise
operators to offer high-level information and comunications services, or
to the connection of public communications circuits, specific communications
circuits, and public communications circuits (so-called public-specific-
public connection) which is necessamy for the establishment of
information-process ing networks .

On the other hand, MI‘i‘I intends to seek stmngly the Postal
Services Ministry's overall opening of the market for data communications,
on the strength of the Provisional Administrative Affairs Research
Council's recommendation calling for the overall liberalization of
data communications. For this reason, the focal point has shifted to
the problem of whether the proposed liberalization in the field of
high-level information and comunications services will be incorporated
i.. the Public Tele-Commmications Law Revision Bill this time.

[19 Feb 82 p 3]

[Text]

The problem of whether efforts should be made to cope with the
proposed liberalization of data communications through the enactment
of a new law (data comunications law) or through the revising of the
existing law (Public Tele—Comunications Law), on which problem the
assertions of the Postal Services Ministry and HITI were in a sharp
conflict. has come to an end along the line of revising the Law now
in force. with the Postal Services Ministry's having given up
establishing a new law. The reason for this is that the Postal
Services Ministry's view urging the establishment of a new approval or
permission system was not accepted. due to the large-scale current of
administrative reform, calling for the re-adjustment or rationalization
of [projects which require] approval or permission. with this as a
turning point, however, the Ministry has shifted to the tactic of
restricting the liberalization this time. The focal point is whether
high-level comunications ser.-ices. which can also be said to be the

67
roe omcm. use ONLY
nucleus of the proposed liberalization of data'communications, will
be included among the objects of the liberalization through the
revising of the Law this time. The Postal Services Ministry intends
to give up liberalizing high-level communications services, but
MITI and industrial circles concerned are showing strong repulsion
against this. The problem of liberalizing data communications will

enter its second round of development as to how far the scope of
liberalization should be expanded.

"Has thu Postal Services Ministry really given up enacting a
new law?" News about Postal Services Minister MINOHA's statement,
which said that "the Postal Services Ministry has given up enacting a
new law," was conveyed to the Government-LDP side on the 16th. At
that time, MITI leaders looked as if they were unable to quite believe
[the news]. On the other hand, the Postal Services Ministry administrative
officials concerned were also bewildered, as they were unable to
grasp the real intention of the Postal Services Minister.

The major reason why a decision was rapidly reached to give up
the planned enactment of a new law, was the Provisional Administrative
Affairs Research Council's second recommendation calling for the
re-adjustment or rationalization of the approval or permission system.
The Government-LU? side earlier decided to cope with the proposed
liberalization of data communications through a "bill concerning the
package handling of the re-adjustment or rationalization of the
approval or percussion system." The atmosphere within the LDP was
as represented by the view that "such a bill (as a new bill called for
by the Postal Services Ministry), which will necessitate the granting
of approval or permission, cannot be included in the proposed bill
calling for the re-adjustment or rationalization of the approval or
permission system" (LDP Administrative and Financial Affairs Research
Council Chairman MASHIMOTO). Moreover, at a Cabinet meeting, slated
for the 13th, the Government will decide to "respect the Provisional
Administrative Affairs Research Council's recommendation." The large-
scale current of administrative reform by the Government and the L)?
a: one body can be said to have become connected with the settlement
of the problem in the form of revising the Law now in force.

However. the Postal Services Ministry has not made overall concessions,

though it has given up the planned enactment of a new law. Rather,

it is resorting to the tactic of rolling back with the substantial
contents, in place of discarding the formal problem of whether [the
situation should be settled] through the enactment of a new law or

through [the revising of] the Law now in force. The first step for

that purpose was the emergency press conference which Postal Services
Ministry Tale-Communications Policy Bureau Director General MORIZUMI

held on the 17th. MORIZUMI definitely stated as follows: "The

preconditions (including the preservation of couummications secrets
and co-ordination of fields between private industrial circles

concerned and the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation

68
IIHICHNNCJAI.USEIMULY
[NTT]) for the liberalizing of’high-level commmmications services (VAN)

as to private information and communications enterprise operators have
still not been established through negotiations with HITI. If, this time,
efforts are to be made to cope with the situation only through the
revising of the Law now in force, private information and communications

enterprise operators cannot be permitted to offer high-level
communications services."

This means that the Postal Services Ministry is still not changing
its posture, to the effect that high-level communications services
cannot be extended except under a new law. It also says that it will
give up the proposed liberalization in the field of high-level
communications services, in which field it has been planning to
carry out partial liberalization in the form of enacting a new law,
if it is said that the existing Law alone should be revised. It is
thus carrying out operations to submit a new bill to the next Diet
session, as expectvd at the very beginning, with its usual persevering
posture seen when the three Ministers reached agreement on the
establishment of a new postal individual annuity system and the
handling of the Postal Savings Deliberation Council's recommendation.
When asked if "this will result in delaying the liberalization of
data communications," Bureau Director General PJRIZUHI replied,

"The Government office, which has jurisdiction ever the data
communications-connected legislation, is the Postal Services Ministry.

His logic is that unless the Postal Services Ministry moves, the bill
cannot be submitted [to the Diet].

If the Postal Services Ministry's assertions are to be accepted, then
the proposed liberalization will be limited to the following cases
through the revising of the Law this time: (1) "Joint use" of
communications circuits by two or more companies; (2) "use by others,"
in which private information and communications enterprise operators
will lease communications circuits from NTT and sub-lease them to
other enterprises, and which will not be accompanied by any message
exchange (meaning the transmitting of information as is, without
changing the contents thereof, as in the case of the telephone); and
(3) the connection of computers through the use of personal circuits.
This means that approval will virtually not be granted to the
liberalization of message exchange, which liberalization will be
indispensable for private information and communications enterprise
Operators to offer high-level information and communications services,
or to the connection of public communications circuits, specific
communications circuits, and public communications circuits, which

connection is necessary for the establishment of information-processing
networks.

This field of high-level communications services is a star field
in regard to the liberalization of data communications. Unless that

field is liberalized to private information and communications enterprise
operators this time, the realization of the future image of the

69
F1)R‘0ITWCJAI.IHHE(MNLY
data-comunicat ions liberalization age, in which simultaneous conferences
will be held on the television screen, for example, between the Tokyo
head office and its branch offices in Sapporo, Fukuoka, and other

remote areas, will be delayed to that extent.

. Therefore, from the stand that "if the field of high-level com-
munications services is not liberalized, it will decrease the meaning
of liberalizing data commications," HITI intends to carry out

strong activities to secure the inclusion of the liberalization of

the high-level communications service field in a revision bill concerning
the Law now in force. It is the Provisional Administrative Affairs
Research Council's second recomnendation which supports HITI's
assertions. The recommendation notes as follows: (1) In connection

with the use of data-comunications circuits, liberalization should

be carried out, with the exception of the system of exchanging

messages alone, with an unspecified large number of persons as the
objects; (2) in order to clarify the scope of the minimum necessary
degree of restrictions, a negative-list formula (formula calling for
liberalization in principle and also the listing of plans which cannot
be carried out) should be adopted; and (3) in regard to mutual connection,
the standards for granting approval should be clarified when a separate-
approval system is carried out. In short, the reoomendation calls for
the overall liberalization of data communications. .

The proposed liberalization of data communications cannot but be said
to be incouplete unless the field of higI-level communications system
and exchange of messages are liberalized. In that meaning, future
negotiations between the Postal Services Hinistry and HITI on the
scope of the substantial liberalization may be said to be an important
testing place, from the standpoint of liberalizing data commmications.

(Note) High-level comunications services (VAN) mean that data will
be exchanged and processed, between the data oomunications systems
of different companies through the connection of their own respective
computers with NTT's communicat ions circuits, and through the
establishment -.f networks which will use those computers as switchboards.
This is the most developed form of data communications. Private
information and communications enterprise operators are planning such
services as a future image of data commications services. They are
also said to be added-value comunications services.

[Text]

The Postal Services Ministry formulated the general outline of a
Public Tele-Communications Law revision bill in connection with the
problem of liberalizing the use of data communications circuits, and
obtained the general approval thereof at a meeting of the LDP Policy
Board Communications Department (Chief: Yoshihide HORI), held on the
morning of the zwth. The general outline has been drawn up, accompanying
the fact that in response to the Provisional Administrative Affairs
Research Council's second recommendation concerning the proposed
re-adjustment of the approval or permission system, the planned submitting
of a new bill (data communications bill) to the current Diet session

has been given up. Under the general outline, the utilization of

data communications circuits, which utilization is banned at present,

will be liberalized to a rather great extent, in the information-processing
field. However, it blocks the road leading to the liberalization of
high-level communications services (VAN) which are expected to develop

in the future. The Ministry will submit its revision bill gen-

eral outline to the Administrative Management Agency on the same day.
However, MITI and the Administrative Management Agency are showing
repulsion against the Postal Services Ministry's second draft on the
strength of the Provisional Administrative Affairs Research Council's
recommendation calling for the overall liberalization of data

communications. Complications will probably arise before the problem can
be settled.

In regard to data communications, information will be processed
through the direct connection of computers and counmmications functions, as
in the case of the National Railways' Green (TN: first Class Ticket) Windows
and the banks‘ on-line systems. They are said to be the third communications,
after telegraph and the telephone. At present, restrictions are being :ar:ied
out on the private information and connunications enterprise operators'
leasing exclusive-use circuits from the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Public Corporation (NTT) and their processing information. Industrial
circles concerned have strongly criticized that this has been
impeding the development of industries.

At the very beginning, the Postal Services Ministry had planned to
liberalize the use of data communications circuits through the revising
of the Public Tale-Communications Law now in force, and also through
the enactment of a new data communications law. It had also intended
to put up a new net of approval or permission over the field of data
ceszenications in thc form of establishing a new law. The LDP
Administrative and Financial Affairs Research Council, etc., criticized
this plan, from the stand that it "will go against the current of
administrative reform." The Ministry has finally decided to give up
enaCting a new law and to submit a revision bill as to the existing
Law to the current Diet session.

Under the Postal Services Ministry's second revision-bill general
outline, the use of communications circuits by companies, which have
business relations with each other or with one another, will be
liseralized. in regard to the "joint use" of such circuits by two or
more companies. Also, as regards the exchange of messages (meaning
the transmitting of information as is, without changing the contents
thereof, as in the case of the telephone), it will be approved, for the
first time, if it is to be carried out between or among companies

72
F!”l(ﬂﬁﬁ(ﬂAl.USE¢3NLY
_which have close Fusiﬁess connections with each oth'e'r-or with one another.
It will become possible to establish communications systems, for

example, between manufacturing industrialists and retail business-persons,
between tourism enterprisers and hotel-keepers, and between transportation
enterprisers and warehousing enterprisere, which system have been

banned up until now.

with regard to "use by others," which is regarded as a focal point,
from the standpoint of fostering and developing the private information
and commnications services, and in which information and comunications
enterprise operators will lease circuits from m and sub-lease them
to other enterprises, it will be liberalized if it is for data-
processing purposes. However, in regard to high-level communications
services which will be accompanied by the exchange of messages, and
which the Postal Services Ministry had planned to incorporate in the
proposed new law, [the liberalization thereof] will not be approved,
partly for the reason that "it is impossible to preserve communications
secrets through the revising of the Law now in force." Therefore,
under the Postal Services Ministry's draft plan, it will be impossible
for private information and comunications enterprise operators to offer
such high-level communications services as computer comunications services

or mail services (services for transmitting documents for office
automation).

Moreover, concerning the connection of public communications circuits,
specific comunications circuits, and public commieations circuits
(so-called public-specific-public connection) which will become indispensable
for private information and comunications enterprise operators to
offer information-processing networks, it will be placed under an
individual approval system, on the grounds that there is fear of its
causing the utilization of services similar to telegraph and telephone
services which are the regular services of NTT. The connection of
public comunications circuits with specific comunications circuits
(public-specific connection) will not be approved, either, in the case
of carrying out message exchange.

Far Removed from Overall Liberalization'I H111 to Show Repulsion

In connection with the Postal Services Ministry's draft plan for the
liberalization of data communications, HIT! intends to show strong
repulsion, from the stand that the exchange of messages in regard to
use by others will be limited in actual substance, and that it is far
from the overall liberalization of data comnications, assought
by “ITI up until now. It also intends to press for a large-scale
revision of the Postal Services Ministry's draft plan.

In regard to the Postal Services Ministry's draft plan, HITI has
particularly taken up the following points as problem: (1) The

73

run Vl'l'l‘olﬂh van VIVA-I

 

information-processing system (such as mail services), including
message exchange as to use by others. has not been approved, and the
proposed use by others will also be inconsistent with the Provisional
Administrative Affairs Research Council's recommendation calling for
liberalization in principle; (2) in the case of use by others, the scope
of liberalization will be limited, when compared with joint use, and
this will be disadvantageous for medium and small enterprises which .
cannotbuttely on the networks to be established by information-processing
enterprisers; and (3) the concrete contents of the planned liberalization
are not clear, because they will be decided on the basis of the

Postal Services Ministry Ordinance or on the basis of the Standards

for granting approval.

MITI plans to sound out the Postal Services Ministry on its way
of thinking as to these concrete problematical points and to seek the
revising of the Public Tele-Communications Law in the form of following
MI?I'5 basic policy for securing the overall liberalization of data
communications.

Gist of the Postal Services Hinist 's Draft Plan for Liberalization
of Data Communications '

Following is the gist of the Postal Services Ministry's draft plan
for liberalizing the use of data communications circuits:

1. Joint Use of Specific Comunications Circuits: The individual
approval system concerning the joint use of specific communications
circuits shall be abolished, and at the same time, the Postal Services
Ministry Ordinance shall be revised as follows:

(i) Necessary communications for services, which have continuous

transactions, can be freely establ’:aed if they are for data-processing
purposes.

(2) If they are State organizations, local public entities,
two or more persons who engage in the same line of business, or
persons who have close business relations with each other. [the use
of communications circuits], including the utilization of telegraph and

telephone services, can be freely secured, though it has not been
approved up until now.

2. Joint Use of Public Communications Circuits: Restrictions on
the joint use of electronic computers, etc., shall be abolished,
with regard to contracts for the use of public connmnic.‘ions circuits.

3. Use of Specific Communications Circuits by Others: The standards
concerning use by others, as set forth in Paragraph 1, Article 55-13
of the Public Tele-Communications Law, shall be revised, while

to enable the free use of circuits for data-processing purposes.

u. Mutual Connection of Specific Communications Circuits and
Public Communications Circuits: In reference to the connection of
specific communications circuits and public communications circuits,
the individual approval system shall be abolished, and efforts shall be
made to enable the connection thereof under the certain standards to be
prescribed by a Postal Services Ministry ordinance. Moreover, the connec.

tion of public conuunicatione circuits, specific connunicationa circuits, and

public communications circuits can be secured with approval, though
it has not been approved up until now.

5. Connection to Electronic Computers, Etc., to Be Installed by
Others: Connection to electronic computers to be installed by
contractors under the use-by-others system and to electronic computers,
etc., to be installed by others involved in the contracts can be secured
if it comes under the certain standards to be prescribed by a Postal
Services Ministry ordinance, or if it obtains individual approval.

6. Installation of Input and Output Equipment, Etc.: The Public
Corporation or companies can offer input and output equipment, etc.,
to contractors for the use of specific communications circuits or
contractors for the use of public communications circuits.

Supplementary Note: When the Public Tele-Communications Law is
partially revised, in order to consolidate the use of data communications
circuits, the strengthening of the Penal Regulations, which is an
urgent task, shall be carried out.

(1) In regard to persons who engage in public tele-communications
services, the provisions of the Penal Regulations concerning their
obligation to preserve secrets shall be strengthened.

(2) The amcu:.s of fines, mentioned in the Penal Regulations,
shall be revised.

HITI on the 2uth formulated an opinion of criticism, to the effect
that the general outline of a Public Tele-Communications Law revision

bill, drawn up by the Postal Services ministry in connection with the
problem of liberalizing data communications, "is still far from liberal-
ization.“ MIT: says that if the Postal Services Ministry's draft plan

76
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
is to be followed, then problems will remain as to the following points:
(1) The scope of liberalization is indefinite; therefore, there is the
fear that depending on how it is operated, it may violate the Provisional
Administrative Affairs Research Council's recommendation calling for
the liberalization of data communications, as a general principle; and
(2) this will prove disadvantageous for the processing of information
by medium and small enterprises, which are unable to have their own
computers, when compared with big enterprises. HITI will strongly
request the imprOVement of these points in the course of the Postal
Services Ministry's drawing up a draft revision bill, from now. But the
Ministry is not changing its posture of revising the Law along the

line of its general outline. For this reason, further complications

are expected before early March, when a final decision is expected to be
reached on the revision bill.

Data communications mean the processing of information through the
direct connection of computers and communications functions, as in
the case of the on-line systems of banks. Due to the vigorous
renewal of technology and the appearance of new forms of services
in rapid succession, voices calling for the liberalization of the use
[of data communications circuits] have become stronger, centering on the
enterprises and information-processing services business-persons
who use computers. In response to this request, the Postal Services
Ministry drew up its revision-bill general outline on the 2uth. In regard
to the general outline, HITI points out that there are concrete problems
as to the liberalization of "message exchange" and "use by others."

Message exchange means the transmitting of information as is,
without changing the contents thereof, as in the case of the telephone,
even if it goes through a computer. Data communications for processing
large amounts of information will inevitably include message exchange.
However, the contents of the Postal Services Ministry's draft plan
are such that depending on how the Postal Services Ministry Ordinance
is operated, message exchange can be restricted,in actual substance.

The stand of MITI is that there is fear of its violating the Provisional
Administrative Affairs Research Council's recommendation which emphasizes
that "message exchange should be liberalized,in principle."

Use by others means that information-processing enterprisers will
lease circuits from the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation
(NTT) and sub-lease them to other enteprises. The main objects for the
joint use of communications circuits by two or more companies are
big enterprises, while [those for use by others] are medium and small
enterprises which are unable to have their own computers. However,
under the Postal Services Ministry's draft plan, use by others will be
restricted strictly, compared with joint use. HITI says, "For example,
when trying to establish business contacts by telegram through the
use of data communications circuits, it will not be permitted in the
case of use by others, though it will be possible, in the case of
joint use. There is the fear that this may cause gaps in information

services. which can be used, between medium and small enterprises and
