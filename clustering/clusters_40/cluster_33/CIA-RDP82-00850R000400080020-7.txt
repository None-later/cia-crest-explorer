INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION OVER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY DISCUSSED
Tokyo SHUKAN ‘mYO KEIZAI in Japanese 19 Sep 81 pp 38-41

[Text] Currently technological development strength in the
world is polarized in three regions-~Japan, the United States
and Europeuand the respective merits and weaknesses of these
regions are becoming more conspicuous. One of the deciding
factors is the "technological climate." It is believed that
comercisl warfare with advanced technology playing the axial
role is inevitable in the future. Thus, in order to stave
off "friction" beforehand, the three poles are rushing to
establish trialogues among theaselves.

As far as technological development is concerned, this has become an era in which
the world is divided into three paler-the United States, Europe (Eb-European
Comunity) and Japan. If we exclude the USSR's military technology, these three
poles are indeed the modern "engines" of advanced technology.

The proof of this is found in an informal proposal that the United States Trade
Representative's Office has made to Japan and the EC to discuss comercial ques-
tions involving Japan, the United States and the EC--a call for a "tripolar con-
ference (trialogue)" for a priori prevention of trade frictions. Periodic cabinet-
level meetings to confer on preventive measures to avoid trade frictions involving
advanced technology have been suggested. The proposed participants are: 0.5.
Trade Representative (USTR) Brock, HITI Minister Tanaka and EC Vice Chairman
Haferkamp. As attested by this love, we have entered an era in which these three
polarized regions have exclusive powers in today's technological development com-
petition.

Japan's HITI intends to accept this proposal by the United States and has begun
speeding up the consolidation of views with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
other related agencies. But within the United States, the Defense Department and
the Department of Comerce consider this proposal to be "a solo action" by the
USTR; and there is strong feeling that prior to tripolar discussion, Japan-v.5.
conprehensive trade negotiations should take place. That is to say, U.S. "prag-
matism-a move away from tripolar discussions in favor of Japan-0.3. bipolarisr-

has surfaced .

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR‘OFFKJAL.USE(MVLY

In any event, the Japanese Government has concluded that a tripolar technological
discussion among Japan, the United States and the European Community is indispens-
able for the future, and through the exchange of ideas with U.S. Trade Representa-
tive Block, who arrived Ln Japan 1 September, it is hastening to lay the founda-
tion for establishing a regular "meeting platform for collaboration."

1n the meantime, in Japan itself, the Fifth-Generation Computer Conference involv-
ing Japanese, U.S. and European computer professionals will be held in Tokyo in
October. Already, leading European and American businesses such as In“, TI
(United States), and Siemens (Vest Germany) have sought participation, and there
is a possibility that this conference will result in political-level discussion
above and beyond the discussion of technological developments. _This is so be-
cause the development of the fifth-generation computer is closely tied to ques-
tions of national security and military preparedness.

Inasmuch as the industrial world today revolves around "technology," it would not
be an exaggeration to say that advanced technology is beginning to be used as a
"trump card" on the international political scene.

"Technological Climate" Constitutes an Important Point

Though we use the term "tripolar," the United States, Japan and the European Com-
munity each has its respective specialties and weak spots. Historical background
and national traits have something to do with it. The recent technological refor-
mation has tended to be polarized between micro and macro technologies. Thus the
"climate" of a given country surfaces as a dominant factor in deciding the tech-
nology to be developed in that country.

For example, Japan is strong in tools that can be mass produced, such as cameras,
household electric appliances, and semiconductors. The reason for this, as it is
frequently pointed out, is closely tied to the Japanese workers' industriousness
and superiority. 0n the other hand, the United States is supreme in the fields
of aircraft, space exploration and genetic engineering. This is not unrelated to
the American frontier spirit and the adventurousness of its people. The European
Community—-in particular, West Germany-has traditionally excelled in chemistry
and industrial machines. This is tied in with the European maeater system and
nationalism.

In this fashion, the technological clilate that the national character nurtures
significantly affects technological development-~especially the advanced tech-
nologies. In recent years, the distinguishing characteristics are becoming more
and more pronounced. Import-export totals of the three polarized areas and the
traffic of technicians are indicative of conspicuously distinctive features of
these regions.

In considering the direction of Japanese industry in the future, it is important
to acknowledge such international differences in technological development. This
is becoming an era in which broad-based software--such as a given country's na-
tional character and/or daily coenesthesis--are actually determining technological
developments.

Then, in concrete terms, what is Japan's technological strength, and where is its
weakness? According to a survey conducted by the "Scientific Technology and Eco-
nomic Association" and the Nomura Comprehensive Research Institute, Japanese
technology's strengths and weaknesses may be summarized as follows:

1. Japan has quite strong international competitive strength in steel, ceramics.
automobiles, and precision instruments.

2. Japan has acquired the world's top-level technological skill in such advanced
technology fields as semiconductors, communications equipment and robotics.

3. Conversely, Japan is technologically somewhat inferior in chemical industry,
petroleum-related fields and industrial machines.

4. Japan is quite backward in terms of aircraft. atomic energy-related fields
and in the military instruments sector.

That is to say, Japan is extremely strong in improved or applied technology and
production processing technology but weak in innovative or traditional industries.
These, then. are the contrasting elements in the technological climate of Japan.

of course, the differences are clearly demonstrated in the research developments
which support the technological strengths. A comparison of research development
spending by industries in Japan, the United States and the major European nations
is presented in Table 1. The emphasis of a given nation and the distinctive
characteristics of that nation can be discerned from this chart.

For example, the United States spends J tremendous amount for aviation and space
indusrries. Its total spending in these fields equals the total industrial devel-
opment spending of all other countries. In the chemical industry sector, West
Germany is unquestionably the leader. This is understandable in the light of West
German monopoly of three of the biggest chemical firms in the world--Bayer, BASP,
Hoechet. For Japan, electric appliances and automotive industries receive sur-
passingly dominant shares of the development funds.

In this manner, a look at a country's technological development spending ratio
will tell us that country's emphasis and its specialty; and the background of that
is not unrelated to national character and technological climate.

Steel Technology Is Well Suited to Japanese Character

In the same context, Hr Maseru Ibuka (honorary chairman of the Sony Corporation)
commented on the Japanese technological climate in the following words: "The
Japanese person does not act out of loyalty to the state; he does what he does
with his heart and soul in order to bring profit to the company." "Unless the
merchandise has wide public appeal, it cannot constitute a true industry." "The
generating force of Japanese 'consumer goods' is competition." "‘Cost down' is
indeed the great 'innovation'" and so on. (Fall Issue of CHUO KORON on Economic

Questions)

These comments are not academic utterings by a scholar or a critic. They were
based on his real experience as a businessman, and thus are sterling practical

economic truths. It is the summation of the Japanese technological climate: "Be-
fore all else. there is the national character."

An instance of an industry well suited to the Japanese personality is the iron and
steel industry. Needless to say, Japan has the top-level iron and steel technology
in the world. In recent years especially, it has managed to obtain the most modern
facilities. superior work force, high productivity, high yields and cost competi-
tiveness. It Ear excels its counterparts in the United States and Europe. Japan's
technological development potential in this field is the focus of worldwide atten-
tion.

The iron and steel industry has a processing breadth which turns iron ore into
80,000 different steel products. In terms of complexity of task, it is foremost
among all industries. This complex process production is actually very much suited
to the Japanese personality. Hasaki Horitani (Nomura Soken--Comprehensive Research
Institute) attributes this to the following three factors ("Japan-U.s.-Buropean
Community's Technological Development Har," TOYO KEIZAI):

First of all, though there is lack of pretentiousness in system fundamentals, the
Japanese national character tackles portional improvement of solid technology with
enthusiasm. Second, steel plants are quite complex and therefore a high degree of
operational technology is needed. Japan is particularly strong in this regard.
Third, Japan's strength is in producing 80,000 different products efficiently and
supplying them to consumers in a close-textured supply and demand transaction.

Horitani concludes that, "the steel industry is characterized by the complexity

of its merchandise categories and processing method and the fact that its develop-
ment is tied to improving and bettering. Furthermore, superior manpower at the
production site is the big decisive factor. On these counts. it is an industry
well suited to Japan.

Space and Aviation for the United States, Nuclear Power for Europe

A survey of other Japanese specialty fields--measuring devices, home electric
appliances, cameras and watches--all have inevitable features well suited to the
Japanese national character. As Mr Ibuka's comments, it is an endowment result-
ing from Japan's technological climate borne of Japanese respect for "proficiency
at one's work place."

whereas the Japanese salient characteristics are close fellowship among them-
selves, collective action and exclusiveneas, the Americans have a national charac-
ter of meeting everything in a spirit of challenge. American businesses change
dynamically. and expansion and reduction of operational scope are daily occur-
rences. Genetic technology which has very recently been elevated to stardom is
no exception. Venture capital activities are amazing. Americans are enamored

of biological technology which can make overnight billionaires.

In recent years, the United States has been particularly enthusiastic about space
and aviation technology. The Americans have never shed the spirit of adventurous-
ness which is clasely akin to their yearning for gigantic technology. The re—
search and development funds poured into this sector last year were 5.5 trillion

11

yen-far in excess of Japan's total research and development spending. This
macrotechnology requires a vast system. Social mores such as respect for spe-
cialization, promotion of division of labor and the prominence given to each con-
tract thoroughly permeate American society. Once a big project is finished. then
according to contract, one's services are terminated. This has an indelible in-
print on the American technological climate.

In terms of pride, West Germany. France, and Bngland-the EC countries-~are just
as haughty. west Germany, which lives by the creed of steadfastness, is cur-
rently tops in the world in the field of nuclear power generation. France also
seeks to be the first in high-speed reactor technology. The European Community
as a whole is strong in the nuclear power field. England has traditionally ex-
celled in this sector as well. Each country is staking its own national prestige.

The United States was the world leader in nuclear energy technology originally.
but as it was dominated by the military technology and as a result of problems

with commercial reactors, at present it is at a low ebb. The success of the EC
countries is a result of breaking away from dependence on the United States.

Unlike Japan, which operates on a follow-the-U.S.-1ead mode, the EC countries put
their faith in independent development. In the EC countries there has tradi-
tionally been strong reliance on the technology of one's own country, and in the
case of nuclear energy generation, it has brought about exceptional success.
European self-confidence is remarkable. The superlative union of their peculiar
technological climate and Nest European rationalism led to the success of the
nuclear energy technology. This is a good instance of "self-confidence" and
"pride" playing decisive roles in technological development.

Focal Point Is the Competing Japanese and U.S. Semiconductor Industries

"hat about the current focus-the semiconductor industry. Aside from the military
technology related sector, Japan has now grown to equal the United States in this
field. Especially in terms of the axial machine types today- 16 K RAM and super-
LSI development--Japan holds its own alongside the United States. The IC is re-
garded as the industry's staple commodity. Japan's position in the competition is
quite solid.

But there is an unfathomable quality about the proficiency of the United States-
the true home of semiconductors. In this field, creativity and development capa-
bility are crucial, and it is a field that can easily be tied in with the weapons
industry. The United States‘ predominance appears to be unahakable. Moreover,

a new business boom backed by venture capital is tailor-ads for America. The pro-
duction shares of the major semiconductor manufacturers are shown in Figure 1.

Though the Japanese enterprises are fighting a good battle, the situation may be-
come difficult. It all depends on the United States' future moves. That is to
say, the semiconductor industry in the United States is beginning to be reexamined
within the context of the munitions industry and is regarded as an important factor
in the national policy. As far as Japan is concerned, its only way to survive may
be in focusing its attention on medium-range technology centered around civilian
demand and to aim for repletion of the peripheral maintenance technology.

Right now, there are no pressing commercial frictions, but trade imbalance between
Japan and the Bc is becoming noticeable, and there is concern that the trade fric-
tion on the European front will flare up again this fall. At present, automobiles,
color television sets and machine tools are under supervision. IC, VTR, two-
vheelcd vehicles, and vessels are about to be targeted for regulation. There is
concern that this situation will expand into a full-scale trade var.

With regard to this Japan-Europe situation. a mission composed of Japan's major
industrialists (led by Yoshihiro Inayama) will be sent to Europe in October to pre-
vent possible friction. Between the United States and Japan, a series of talks--
beginning with the Shimoda session at the beginning of this month, a high adminis-
tration-level conference in washington 0.0. during the middle of the month. the
Japan-U.S. Harmonious International Trade Council and so on-are planned.

In any event, there is no doubt that the outcoae of these exchanges will affect
the future of Japanese industry. The need for a platform for talks at various
levels has never been more important to Japan; and it should take the initiative
in these talks. The technological development competition among Japan, the United
States and Europe is at a critical point this fall. This is the time for civilian
and governmental bodies to work out the counterplans.

Immediate Outlook

The outlook for the Japanese auto-
mobile industry for l98| probably
depends on economic developments in
Japan and in the world. particularly in

the United States.
According to the prospects for eco-

nomic developments in I98l reported
by the Economic Policy Committee of
the OECD in late November l980. in
the 24 member countries as a whole.
as the second otl crisis after the revolu-
tion in iran has been overcome more
smoothly than the first oil crisis. inﬂa-
tion has passed its critical stage and

the rise of consumer prices decel-

and ltalran cars. This rovoked even
:ouder criticism against apan.

Deﬁcits in the EC countries‘ bal-
ance or’ payments with Japan have
grown year after year. In I980. ex~
ports from Japan to EC totaled
316.000 million. an increase of 3l.3’."r
Over the year before. while imports
from EC to Japan remained at $7.800
million. up only 3.3% from the
previous year. Thus Japan's excess of
exports swelled to $8.800 million.

The EC Foreign Ministers Council
decided on February l7. l98l. to
introduce a surveillance system to
watch imports of passenger cars. color
television sets. color TV picture tubes
and some machine tools. The EC
commission explained that the put.
pose of this system is not to limit
trade but to obtain statistical data on
the import of these items promptly.
However. some people voiced their
tear that there is a possibility at this
s)stem leading to protectionism.

In EC countries there are loud cries
for sortie measures to settle the auto-
mobile problem similar to the poli-
tical arrangement between Japan and
the L'nited States. Rupture of the
negotiations between JAMA and
CCMC which took place in Paris on
my I5 and to. NM. demonstrates
these views

With the two major markets for
Japanese cars being influenced by such
factors. it will be difficult to increse
exports to these areas. it is considered
desirable for the Japanese to export
automobiles to these areas with mod-
eratron.

it is expected that exports to Saudi

shipments to Iraq will decrease a little
because of the lran-lraq dispute. In
Southeast Aisa business conditions on

and exports to this area are expected

America are expected to relax trade
restrictions Exports to Africa on the

ln Oceania. there is a growing ten
dency to switch over to smaller cars.

According to the forecasts by
Bradycast and Eumt‘inance, the total
demand for automobiles throughout
the world will increase from 42 million
units in I979 to $0 million in H185
and 60 million in I990. The annual
growth rate Will be 3‘7: in the next l0
years as compared with 4% for the

annual average growth rate in the next

nese Cars

necessary to watch carefully rate fluc-

of the world. will see the result very

how to develop new materials in co-
operation with rela_ted industries has
become a matter or urgent necessity.

.«ts far as competitiveness in the
supply of parts is concerned. the prod-
ucts of Japanese automobile parts
manufacturers are excellent in respect
to quality. prices and delivery. More-
over. there is a mutually cooperative
relationship between parts manufac-

~ plants. Such relationship; are unheard

of in foreign countries us. Japanese
automakers are in a decisively advan-
tageous position compared to their
counterparts in Europe and America
which have to develop and manufac-
ture parts inde dently.

Prospects or internationalization
must also beconsidered. There is a cry
for opening markets to the world. and
for promoting actively the internation-
alization of the automobile industry
during the l980s.

Generally. automobile producing
countries import foreign cars in fairly
large quantities. and international ex-
changes in their automobile markets
are quite active. The dependence of
various countries on foreign cars is
roughly 25% for the U.S., 45.5% for
the U.K.. 22% for France. 22% for
West Germany. and 35% for ltaly. The
share of foreign cars in the Japanese

market is a little under 1%. with
annual sales totaling 45.000 units.
Japan is loudly censured for its re-
stricted import of foreign cars due to
non-tariff barriers. The fact is. how-
ever. the Japanese market is now .
This should be publicized more
widely. As domestic demand is ex-
pected to grow to some extent. it Will

portion of demand to foreign cars. It
will be possible to open the market up

All-\N'S auto industry was preoc-

cupied tn the ﬁrst halt‘ot' I981 with
ﬁnding a remedy for various complica-
tions arising from the Japanese-
American auto problem.

The Japanese-American auto ro
blem emerged in the spring of l 80.

when the American auto industry
sought Japan's cooperation to bolster
the American automakers ailing under
teeessron. Japanese auto industry pro-
mised coopera'ion and took various
steps.

This problem covers numerous

aspects. But essentrally ll demands the
establishment of Japanese automakers
on the Annette-an soil (for the produc-
ttt-n of cars and auto parts) as well as
esprndcd rnrports or' Arttertean-made
auto puts by Japan.

Japan cooperated tn the following

Vevertheless. a speedy irn rovement ot'
the situation is not tn sight in spite cf
all these efforts.

The United States. on the Other
hand. has succeeded in restricting the
impnﬂ 0! Ja anese-rnade passenger
cars to 1.860. units in I98! with
the Woluntary" cooperation of
Japanese automakers (with the possi-
bility that the import restrictions may
be extended for several years if neces
saryl. America‘s import tariff for
ubless trucks has been raised from 4%
to 25%. All these steps can seriously
affect l:tpan's auto industry.

These decisions were made irt May
l981. They have a complicated back-
ground involving the Japanese govern-
ment and the auto Industry. At any
rate. they pose amenaetng problem to

the auto and the auto parts industries

Such dramatic growth can be explained by strong poten-
tial demands, and the marketing commencement of a series
of these drugs within recent years. However the total
share of all prescription drug production held by such anti-
cancer dnigs is still extremely low at 3.|% (cash basis).
It is predicted that this year the number one cause of death.

We can expect that demand for anti-cancer drugs will

ECAUSE of the international ship-
ping recession following the oil
crisis in the [all of l973. theiapanese
shipbuilding industry entered a period
of slump and shipbuilding volume
dropped sharply from the l975 peak.
However. from around I979. because
of the restrrcttons on tankers by
IMCO. aged ships were scrapped and
slups to replace them were built. As a
result. bulk carriers were ordered in
anticipation of greater demand for
transporting steam coal due toa sharp
rise in the crude oil price. and. in
addition. ships were built to beat the
anticipated slup price hike. As a result.
in I980. the volume of hundred steel
ships in Japan recovered to 7.280.000
glt lsltips of mo glt and over). This is
only 40“: ot' the 1975 peak but an
increase of 69% compared to the
previous year.
The volume of orders tor new ships

received in 1980 continued the t'avur-
able trend of I979 and contract... were
concluded for about [0.000.000 glt.
Today. Japan has a backlog of orders
equivalent to roughly two years' oper-
ations. -
Among various materials needed t‘ or
ship construction. machinery. such as
engines and auxiliary engines. various
ﬁttings and other ship machinery in-
dustry products. reached ¥93l .300

million in 1980. excluding primary
products. such as steel. nonol'errous
metals. lumber and electric wires. This
comes to 93% of the all-time high.

The quarterly production of the
Japanese ship machinery industry con-
tinued a minus growth for seven quar-
ters from the peak third quarter of
l977, when there was a big demand
for cargo ships. to the second quarter
of NE. Some corporations even went
bankrupt. However. from the third

uarter of 1979 when the volume of
3:59 orders received bepn to recover.

FUTURE OF SEAHLESS STEEL PIPE MAKER SUHITOHD METAL BXAHINED
Tokyo SHUKAN 0R0 TOSHI in Japanese 6 Aug 81 pp 52-57

[Text] It is said that the steel industry is entering an age of contest over
quality from an age of a contest over volume. Sumitomo, which had enjoyed life
as the top maker in the seamless pipe production area as well as benefitting from
the boom, has been digging its spurs toward a higher class alignment in looking
toward the post-boom era. For Sumitomo. which presently derives its greatest
profit from oil well pipe. to be preparing for an anticipated stage of over-
production of seamless pipe 2 years in the future seems to be a somewhat premature
handling of an emergency.

while there is a fierce contest developing to attain a higher class, on the other
hand, there is also some opposition to shortening of processes following the
change to continuous casting and to improvement of dependence on existence of

a loan, which in the past was considered the destined way of handling Erontline
skirmishes involving cost cutting in a wide area. It is not overstating the
case to say that the steel industry has plunged into an are which resembles the
plant expansion conflicts of the past.

where Sumitono is concerned. its superiority in the area of seamless pipe should
prove to be a great weapon in waging battle in this new period of conflict. In
this sense, Sumitomo's development during the next 1-2 years bears watching.

Applauding Seamless Boom

The magnitude of the significance of the oil pipe boom is shown to the maximum
by Sumitomo's present profit structure.

Sumitomo very recently made a large upward revision of its profit plan for the
mid-September period. It reported sales volume of 690b700 billion yen, up from
660 billion yen; ordinary profits, which showed a decline of 10 percent in the
previous period to 40 billion yen. increased 10 percent to 65 billion yen,
indicating a turn for the better.

The reasoning here is that should the yen rate, which had been expected to drop
below 210, remain at an average of over 220 in an assured manner, the price of
OCTG (oil country tubular goods--general designation of steel pipe), of which
seamless pipe makes up the main portion, would be raised upward 20 percent or

48

FOR‘OFFMJAI.USE(MVLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

more compared to the end of the previous period, while at the same time the upward
rise in bunker oil would become relatively smaller, so that the pressure on cost
would be less, and this factor entered into the picture.

Counter to the great improvement in OCTG figures due to a lower yen rate and
increase in price, profits from other operations such as steel plate, formed steel,
and wire as well as steel pipe other than OCTC are being pushed. "OCTG is
providing 90 percent of our profit" (Keinosuke Tamaki, head of Accounting Depart-
ment), and the contribution of OCTG to the profit picture is extremely high.

Looking at the present order picture, it is expected that this bright picture in
seamless pipe will continue through the latter half of this year. In another
direction. the unsettled domestic market is undergoing a recovery which may be
somewhat late, but storage facilities are slowly increasing, and at least some
improvement is taking place. As a result, the ordinary profit through this period
will be 95 billion yen at least, and this can rise up to the lOO-billion-ysn
plateau if the yen rate should remain at 230. If the seamless boom continues
through next year, "the domestic picture will improve somewhat (vice president
Ryutnro Uesaka), and if that happens, it will be certain that the improved profit
base adjustment will be maintained.

How long will this boom in oil well pipe which brings high profit continue for
Sumitomo?

Behind this boom in oil well pipe is, first of all, President Reagan's abolishing
of the oil price control system, as a result of which oil development in the United
States was reactivated. "here the number of active drilling rigs in the United
States had dropped to a minimum of 1,600, very recently this number exceeded

4,000 rigs, and the net result has been that America's dependence on imported

oil decreased from what was at one time 50 percent to 38 percent.

At the same time, the increase in crude oil prices raised the level of minimum
drilling cost, and very deep wells or low-quality shallow wells which in the past
could not even be considered became drilling targets. As the well depth became
greater, the demand for pipe per well increased, while abandoned shallow wells
began to he reworked in large numbers, resulting in a spectacular increase in
the number of wells.

The result of all this has been that American demand for oil well pipe jumped
from the former 2.5 million tons/year to about 4 million tons/year expected

for this year. The Lone Star State predicts that this total will be 7.8 million
tons in 1985.

Besides the United States, the Soviet Union is importing slightly under 400,000
tons of oil well pipe and Europe is importing about 200,000 tons, while oil-
producing countries such as Mexico, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia are talking about
increasing their orders, so there is an active demand for oil well pipe. As oil
drilling efforts increase, the need for large-diameter pipe to transport oil

will also increase.

Japan supplies roughly 70 percent of the export market for the oil well pipes

that is in great demand throughout the world. Sumitomo accounts for about 40
percent of Japan's production, or about 10 million tons. Its export volume is
greater than that of the combined efforts of Germany, France, and Italy. It is
said that in Europe seamless pipe is used where Japan uses welded pipe, and any
seamless pipe left over for export is somewhat scarce. The actual picture is that
Sumitomo, which at present is the world's largest oil well pipe Lndustry, will

be in an enviable position for a while.

Being in a position to benefit most from this seamless boom is a good opportunity
for a large steelmaker to improve its debt dependence structure.

In order to reinforce its competitive strength through modernization of its
facilities, this company has increased its investment in facilities, which had
been limited to 50-60 percent of the amrtization fund at about 60-70 billion

yen, to 100 billion yen. The expenditure this year will be 136 billion yen on

a construction base and 107 billion yen on a disbursement base. On the other hand,
by the change in the amortization to a fixed-rate method, the amortization cost
will increase by roughly 13 billion yen (10.43 billion yen the previous period),
while profits will maintain this year's increased profit base adjustment, and
"there will be roughly a 40 billion yen surplus" (Uesaka). The interest-due
obligations. which had decreased to 1.0108 trillion yen at the end of the previous
period, will most certainly drop below the trillion level this period.

At the same time, the stock is approaching the 300~yen level, and the possibility
exists that they will issue convertible bonds. There already were two issues
last year, for 50 million dollars and 100 million Swiss francs, but these
conversions achieved roughly 70 percent of their goals, and preparations are under
way for a domestic package offering this fall which will be based on the dollar
and Swiss franc to float a 60 billion yen bond issuance. Because this conversion
has swelled the amount of ready capital, there is greal likelihood that there
will be 3 to 5 percent voluntary reduction during the course of the year.

The stock is presently hovering around 300 yen and is not moving, but if it should
rise to over 350 yen, large-scale public subscription would become feasible.

Desperately Defending Pipe Top Position

Sumitomo Hetals has been using its superiority in the seamless pipe area as the
lever to promote active improvement in its own structure.

0n the Other hand, other companies are not looking at these high profits in
seamless pipe without any thoughts of their own.

Nippon Steel, Kawasaki Steel, and Nippon Kohan, which are already in seamless
pipe construction, are making plans to increase their production, while welded
pipe makers such as Maruichi Steel Tube and Kubota Ltd have opened and are
expanding their oil well pipe areas. In addition, U.S. Steel has started to
expand its production with capital advances from the oil majors, and there are
other expansion plans in the offing in the Western countries.

50

0n the other hand. the design and construction of seamless pipe plants requires
1 and 1/2 to 2 years at the minimum, and it will be 1983 at the earliest when
the increased production on the part of the Japanese companies will appear. The

production from the Western sphere will be even later, and will come along 1985-
86.

It does not seem possible that 2 years hence, when the production of these four
campanies including Sumitomo Metals will come up to more than #0 percent, there
will he an oversupply in seamless pipe. The demand for oil well pipe will increase
with the rise in price of oil along with the need to drill even deeper wells. 0n
the other hand. anyone can see that if the increase in demand should be blunted
while the supply increases greatly. the present high profits could no longer be
maintained.

The situation is that at the time of the first boom, Sumitomo Metals was
experiencing a high yield while other companies were struggling, but then it
suffered bitterly in the period of decreased demand that followed. With this in
mind. this company is making every effort to capitalize on the present boom.

Looking at this present bOom, "it should continue for 1-2 years” (Uesaka). In
the interim up to 1983, when the results of plant expansions are expected to
appear. an increase in the ratio of electrically formed pipe in the total oil
well pipe area should continue the shift to high-profit OCIG. Seamless pipe,
in particular, is expected to increase its weight among high class pipe. and
following this with electrically formed pipe should give the company the high
add-on value provided by seamless pipe, the improved degree of operability of
electrically formed pipe, and increased volume of production of OCTG overall.

In another direction, the aim of the new mill presently under construction at
Kainnn, which is expected to come into production by the end of 1982, is not
simply to expand the production capacity. Production of smaller bore pipe is
planned for this new mill, and by varying the product mix between the products of
this new mill, the other mill at Ksinan, and the first mill at Hekayama, improved
productivity is envisioned along with a well-rounded product array.

In the technological development front. the greatest emphasis is being directed
at the development of high class pipe.

Sumitomo Metals had been producing boiler tubes for the navy since before the
war, and the technology it had developed was the basis for its entry into the
production of oil well pipe at the end of the war along about 1950. It was able
to obtain API (American Petroleum Institute) approval upon entering the American
market after a very trying period, and it initiated mass export of oil well pipe
in 1951. This is the background to the number one producer of boiler tubes

for electric power use and energy related piping (oil well pipe, oil transport
pipe).

1t rude its start in the area of boiler tubes, which are high class pipe, and
significantly. it started at an early stage to canform to API specifications,

51

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

while the technology for post processes such as heat treatment and thread cutting
was being taken up.

Spur To High Class Alignment

At the present time, the SH series pipe. which greatly surpasses APT specifications
on high-temperature corrosion-resistance and high tensile strength, and the V!
joint (Sumitono Metals is the only company in Japan making this product), which is
a special air-tight joint which was developed jointly with the French Barorec
Company. are indicators of the high-class route for pipe which this company hopes
to take. Demand for either product is not very large as yet, but these are
intended for use under very harsh conditions, and this route may be classed as

one of the answers to just what to do when the boom fades.

while defending its position as the top maker in the area of pipe, this company
is also planning to "exploit oversupply in the pipe area and is looking toward
production of high class steel plate" (Ueaaka), and this again is a major
problem.

At the present time, the largest market for steel plate is thin plate for auto-
mobile production, but recently the reduction in weight concept for energy
conservation has become the overriding factor in the automobile industry. The
development of lighter and stronger high tensile strength steel plate has become
a desperate contest. In the midst of this race Sumitoro Metals came out with what
is called "the dream steel plate": it is soft during fabrication but on being
painted and baked it turns into a tough metal, the so-called high-formability
bake-hardening cold rolled steel plate, which this company was the first to
introduce to the industry. Its array of products ranging from a tensile strength
of 35 kilos to 100 kilos puts this company right alongside Nipon Steel.

This material is particularly good when both ends are difficult to work, and "we
are working at the frontiers of quality" (horio Takahaahi, member of Second
Technology Development Department). The high add-on value is evident when one
sees that the share of high tensile strength steel for automobile use is 1.5
times greater than the share of crude steel.

This company at an early stage also produced steel plate electroplated with a
high corrosion-resistant alloy for use as rust-resistant plate at sites
difficult to paint .

There is also a development battle brewing in the area of various types of
precoated steel plate for use in various household electrical appliances, and

it may be said that development of surface-treated steel plate and high tensile
strength steel plate, which in a broad sense represents a users' coalition of
household appliances and automobiles, has become the subject of maximum attention.
The fact that the accumulation of heat treatment technology and alloy steel
technology is being exploited makes this situation similar to that of pipe.

Where thick plates are concerned, this company shares the market with Nippon
Steel in 9 Ni thick plate which can be used down to —165‘, in addition to which

52

FOR OFFKJAI.USE(NNLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

this company is tops regarding high tensile strength thick steel plate for raised
water power plant use. At the same time, the SET steel plate, which can be used
down to -60° and which is produced by a process requiring no hardening and
tempering processes, making possible a large reduction in cost, is being highly
evaluated for applications such as LPG tanks and line pipe. This steel plate is
also used as the work material for electrically seamed pipe and is thereby also
contributing to the development of high class electrically seam-welded pipe.

In addition, coal liquefaction (COM), carbon fiber as a byproduct activity of

coke gas, and hydrogen production are being treated as independent areas of
development. Where engineering is considered, the risks are too large concerning
hard areas such as plants, as a result of which they are regarded rather passively,
while greater attention will be directed mainly at soft areas such as technological
cooperation, according to present policy. On this front, this company was asked
last year for technological guidance in the area of continuous casting and seamless
technology from three plants--U.S. Steel, Bethlehem Steel, and J and L Steel.

This is evidence of the high international evaluation of Sumitomo Hetels'
technological strength.

Activities of Other Cospanies

Nippon Kokan, which ranks second in the area of seamless pipe, has the capacity

for a mOnthly production of 100,000 tons. It is presently investing 90 billion

yen in order to increase its facilities for producing medium-diameter seamless
pipe. This new plant is expected to be completed in September 1983, and monthly
production will be increased by 50,000 tons. This company has a long history where
pipe is concerned, and its drill pipe for oil well use is evaluated particularly
highly throughout the world. Where drill pipe is concerned, it is presently
absolutely top domestically.

Nippon Steel is tops in overall pipe production. It ranks third in the area of
seamless pipe and rubs shoulders with Kawasaki Steel in this respect. It
established a Steel Pipe Industry Department this year and plans to promote

the production of seamless pipe. It is presently aiming for monthly production

of 100,000 tons and has started expansion at its Yawata steel plant. It plans

to increase capacity of small-diameter seamless pipe to 50,000 tons and medium-
diameter pipe to 47,000 tons by March 1983. The total cost will be 80 billion yen.

Where the above three companies are expanding their rolling facilities for seamless
pipe, Kawasaki Steel will be able to increase production simply by working on the
post treatment process of the refining line. The monthly capacity of its Chita
plant is 110,000 tons, but the refining line is the bottleneck, so that the

actual monthly production is 62,000 tons. It is investing 37 billion yen to make
primary and secondary expansions which are presently under way, and it hopes to
produre 69,000 tons by March 1982. The third-stage expansion may soon get under
way. The ultimate goal is to realize the 110,000-ton capacity of the rolling
facility.

About the latter half of 1983, when the expansions of these companies are expected
to be completed, the monthly production is expected to undergo a large increase,

53

from the present 300,000 tons/month to 500,000 tons/month, and there are some

who fear a stage of oversupply. Nevertheless, each company is reinforcing its
production of high class products for which all indications are for sharply
increased demand, and the belief is that rather than destroying the demand balance.

Japan's seamless pipe will take a firm seat in the area of high class products
in the world market.

Kumagai: when seen from a worldwide viewpoint, steel is not on a declining trend
where volume is cancerned. There is the area represented by aluminum and chemical
materials, but new applications are appearing. Even though we do not expect
periods of very high growth, the volume will still increase.

0n the other hand. production on the part of developing countries is increasing,
and Japan will not be able to expand its production of ordinary steel above its
present level. Re have no choice but to forgo aiming at volume, but instead
must set our sights on producing high quality material.

[Question] Please give some specific examples of higher quality.

Kumagai: One such item is the alloy steel area in which other materials are

added to iron to form new materials. Some examples are the development of

pipe which is resistant to the corrosive action of gases of high sulfur content

and development of light and highly corrosion~resistant steel plate. Another is
the assembly of steel pieces for applications in areas where steel could not be
used before. For example, supplying steel which is easy to use and fabricate for
structures such as the Honshika Bridge. We are somewhat behind where the latter
type product is cancerned, but the former is a profitable one for us. Particularly
in the area of pipe. I consider that we are a step ahead.

[Question] Do you think the Japanese steel industry has surpassed that of the
United States?

Kumagai: The American industries had other profitable products so that they
neglected steel. That is why their facilities became delapidated and the produc-
tiOn rate suffered. 0n the other hand, they are now engaged in an allqout

effort toward the rebirth of steel, and their will to do so has been rekindled.
They have a technological development strength that should not be belittled.

[Question] Even where facilities are concerned, Japan must not be caught napping;
otherwise it will surely be bested once again by the United States.

Kumagai: That is so. Technology is advancing. and Japan's present facilities
will be out of date in another 5-10 years. Should modernization of the American
plants take place in the meantime, there is adequate cause for the possibility
of a reversal which will see the United States leading us once again. The
problem is whether Japan will plan to revitalize its plants in the interim.

[Question] Speaking of physical constitution, is there a problem in fiscal
constitution?

Kumagai: To achieve modernization on borrowed mney is beset with the interest
problem. There is a need to raise the profit level and assure longer internal
residence tine of funds as well as to consider means of fund raising other than
borrowing. While exploiting the value of time is the best, it is difficult because
there is the premise that a high profit system that sustains high stock price is

a necessary condition. we will use convertible bond issuance for the time being.

[Question] Hill the high profit fros pipe at present nske for a good opportunity
to reinforce the physical structure?

Kunagai: The fate will be determined within the next 2 years. He will develop a
pipe which will be second to none and we also plan to iwrove the quality of our
plate. He may fall behind in the volume of plate, but we will never fall behind
in quality.

ENVIRONMENT INDICATION SYSTEM FOR ROBOTS DEVELOPED

Tokyo TECHNOCRAT in English Vol 14 No 7, Jul 81 pp 49-52

[Text]

The control systems section of the Electrotechnial
Laboratory. which has been engaged in study of intelligent
robots. has successfully developed a system which indicates
the work environment of a robot.

This system easily enables one to generate an environment
model at a distance without entertng the actual worlt environ-

ment at the robot. At this time. one does not have to handle
such live numeric data. as ol’ position or angle in most cans.
Moreover it enables one. by a aupertmposed display. to
generate the model on an interactive basis as always monitoritu
the internal model. The environ-

ments with less him.

The Outline of the work environment indication system
Just developed is given below. The environment indication
system is made up mainly of a laser pointer and a superimposed
display iFigJ). The laser pornter enables a laser beam spot

saurce. thus determining the position of the desired point.
The superimposed display enabies one to superimpote given
infonnatton in line images or characters onto the actual
cnvtronment displayed on the monitor screen. The monitor
screen is divided into 640x480 graphic elements each cor-
responding to which storage is given. The contents stored
are synchronized with a TM camera and readout sequentially
to be superimposed on an imaging signal and disphyed on
the screen.

64

Conﬁguration ot‘ the actual system is given in Fig.2.
Interfacing between hardware and the 3-dimensional position
ate-statements is performed by a PD? ”/34 computer and
model conﬁguration. or by graphic processing by the host
computer COSMO. The TV camera. the laser beam source.

Environment modeling is performed as follows: The operator
ppliea the laser spot onto the characteristic point on the
modeling subject by operating the laser pointer as seen on
the display monitor on which the actual environment is
displayed. The system detects the spot position as the lightest

EINING CENTERS PRODUCTION DISCUSSED

.n English Vol 11. No 7, Jul 81 pp 39-142

Domestic production of machining centers (MC) in 1980
reached 5,231 units. surpassing for the ﬁrst time the 5,000
mark. Japanese-made machining centers first appeared on the
market in 1976 when i33 units were produced. so i980’s
production shows a 40-fold increase In barely five years.

This rapid increase reflects the industry's investment efforts
for rationalization of equipment and labor saving. and demands
for numerically controlled (NC) machine tools including MC's
are expected to increase considerably further.

0f the 107 machine tools makers. members of the Japanese
Machine Tool Builders Association, those who at present
manufacture MC's number 3|. in addition. there are about
eight MC makers who are not members of the MBA. so
nationwide about 40 firms now manufacture machining centers.
This means that in 1980. each of these 40 firms produced
an average of l4 MC‘s a day. Machining centers are the fruits
or’ the entire technology a machine tool maker accumulates
over along period. therefore it is very heartening that such
highly sophisticated machines are produced on such a scale
and by so many maltets.

The balance sheets for the March accounting period for
machine tool makers recently made public. without exception
show greatly increased profits over the previous term. As to
what has contributed to these increased profits cannot be ex-
plained by a sweeping generalization since these makers produce
different mixes of machine tools, but one thing sure is that
NC machine tools. especially NC iathes and MC's. have made
significant contributions.

it used to be that. as an industry. manufacture of machine
tools was very vulnerable to ﬂuctuations in economy. with
usually a boom year followed by three years of poor sales.
Since the bottoming out the 1975 recession. the industry's

sales have been steadiiy increasing for the past 6 years.
riding on the crest of a boom for NC machines and helped
by increased exports that have offset a slacking domestic
demand.

What contributed to the industry‘s strong showing until
now, has been MC“: and NC latltes. to begin with, and then
transfer machines. automatic lathes and electrospatk ntachining
machines for the automobile industry. Demands for such
machines may in the future encounter periods of slight or
moderate adjustment. but as Takeo Okuma. president of
Okuma Machinery Works, states. “The future is fantastic". so
the prospects for machine tools seems very bright.

Even though the prospects for certain kinds of machine
tools are bright. there are slight differences in tone of recent
announcements. For example. President Koichiro Kitamura
of Kitamuta Machinery Co. is among those who take a
bullish View. and says. "Domestic production of MC‘s this
year will reach the 8.000 mark. When I say 8.000 units.
I mean machtnrng centers by their very character.as compound
machining machines. will encroach on the demands for both
drilling and milling machines that functionally compete with
MC's". Sources close to NTBA on the other hand. are more
moderate, “At the best. output will show a 40% gain over
last year to reach the 1.000 mark". This ﬁgure itself wems
to indicate that the production of machining centers may
have reached a peak when it is a fact that the domestic
production of NC lathes last year was 12,036 uttits.

What reaUy seems to be in the minds of MC makers is.
"The battle this year will be fought centered on MC's".
"The emphasis is being shifted from production of NC lathes
to production of MC‘s“. states Kinroku Degawa. president of
Hitachi Seiki Co. Masatoshi Shimizu. president of Makino

Milling Machine Co.. says. ”We manufactured 258 machining
centers last year and this year's goal is 50% up". President-
Okuma of Okuma Machinery Works says. “Facilities and
equipment in big companies are now obsolete, and we can
expect a demand for large-scale replacement". “We are planning
to greatly expand our MC department". says Masafumi Yamabe
of Toshiba Machine Co. "We started shipping MC's from
July. and we expect them to become the No.2 pillar after
NC iathes”. as stated by Mort Precision Machinery Works.
Shin Nippon Koiti Co. plans “to exploit the market at home
and abroad on the strength of our achievements in delivering
large-scale machines to the aircraft utdustry". Nakamuta-Tome
Precision Industry Co. displays its enthuslasm for MC‘s by
saying. "We are going to newly enter the ﬁeld by introducing
onto the market new types of energy-saving machines".

There ts now an opinion that if all these firms start
Increasing production at the same time. the balance between
supply and demand will easily be disrupted. However. the
must-mus ut' the industry is summed up by President Kizamura
t-t' Kitamura Machinery Co. who in his attempt to explatn
the current siteation facing the MC industry likened it to a
“Sumo" match where all wrestlers are up in the ring for a

69

showdown. Some people fear Increased competition for sales
between MC makers on the domestic front so that they can
recover any fall in exports caused by trade frictions with
Europe.

Exports of machine tools in I980 amounted to ‘(269.577
million. which accounts for 39% of the total value of the
year's production which stands at V683.048 million. Of
this. exports of MC's mulled 2.920 units worth V6l.4$l
million.

Of the 5.23! MC‘s manufacturcd in I980, 55% were
exported. That is. over a half of the total output was destined
for export to foreign countries.

By export markets. exports to Europe numbered l,209
units (1.004 units to EC countries). while exports to North
America were 1,436 units.

The future tasks facing the machine tools industry are
(I) prevention of any meaningless price war domestically.
and (l) for exports. to gain recognition of made-ln-Japan
machine tools as being f trst class brand~name products.

Fortunately. the orders for machine tools for this year
from the domestic users are expected to stay at the same high
level as last year, worth some ¥620 billion. With backlogs
teaching as mttch as a half of their annual production, all
the machine tools makers are producing at full capacity.
On the Other hand. management is taking a very cautions
attitude towards equipment investment for capacity expansion.
This ts itest illustrated by the words of Umeo Oyama. president
of Tsugamt C0,. who stated. "We wtll make investments for
labor-saving and rationalization. but no equipment investment
merely aimed for capacity increase. We have learned from
our past bitter experiences". In tius way, efforts of all fonts
are directed towards building up internal reserves and reducing
interest payments by refunding previously borrowed money.

The corporate posture being as such. it seems that a situation
has been created where the excessive competition that has
accompanied every past recession will hardly materialize this
tune.

The problem rather wtll be how to avoid the misunder-
standings of Europe and America with respect to makers‘
being unable to comply with their demands. Exports of MC‘s.
along with NC larhes. are subject to cartel restrictions under
the Import-Export Trade Act. Under this law. the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry (MIT!) can guide the
machine tools industry to set the minimum prices for machining
centers and .\'C lathes bound for export to North America
and Europe. The objective of the law is to eliminate excessive
competition and thus avoid confusion in export markets.

Despite such voluntary restraints by Japan. European
countries. and also the US. to a lesser extent. are viewing the
inroads of Japanese .\'C machine tools With increased alarm.

In February this year. the EC Commtssion placed cars
and color TV‘s imported from Japan on the lrst for restricted
imports from Japan. The contents of the decision were made

Both Japan and the EC are trying to detetmine how this

from the advanced countries in Europe and America. Now,
it is the time we should return favors".

While almost all NC machine tools retain many of the
mechanical features of their base machines. i.e. conventional
machine tools. only machining centers have succeeded in
achieving a metamorphosis as machines where the most is
made or' the characteristics of numerical control.

About 30 years after the first NC machine tools came
to he used. and then a further is years after that. the machining
center was born out of a concept that is quite a departure
from the mere numerical control of conventional machines.
The MC seeks to incorporate the functions of NC as main
elements while retaining machining and ATC as subordinate
elements for control.

Once a workpiece rs loaded. the machine performs worit
on all planes in all machining operations. In early stages of
the development of MC's. a machining center was understood
to mean a machine that performs machining operations on
all planes except the plane by which the workpiece is attached
to the machine. Emphasis then was placed on the development
of automatic tool change (ATC). The placing of emphasis
also is related to problems of patent. The number of tools
stored in an ATC has steadily increased from ten or so at
the initial stage to currently when most ATC's store several
times this number. Machines having a drum structure have
also been developed one being YMS of Yamazaki Machinery
Works. that can easily held several hundred tools.

There are machines developed that by changing the tool
head. they can use large-size tools. as well as machines
designed to use tools with numerous cutters.

As for controls of the mechanical system. simultaneous
control of three to five axes has become the norm. and
wrth reaching this level and combined with the previously
mentioned ATC function. MC‘s have attained all the functions
expected of them when ﬁrst conceived several years ago.
in subsequent years. computer numerical control (CNC) of
machining centers has made rapid strides supported by
advances in nunicompu'er and microcomputer technology.
MC’s have registered significant improvement and expansion
in terms of software. such as MDI with built-in CRT to
begin with. and to include tape editing functions. computation
and accuracy-commasating functions. etc.

Thus. in terms of function. MC‘s as machines may be viewed
as having already progressed well past the initial stages of
development. Hereafter, development trends are likely to
head MC‘s into an age where corrections or compenntions
of functions are attempted by incorporating new developtnents _
in detectors and sensors.

.\iuch hope is placed on .\iC‘s in future use. not as single
units but as hne machines.

One of the great weakeneser ot‘ the MC has been its
development as a general-purpose machine wrth special em-
phasis placed on ATC. As with most other NC machine tools.
an MC can itave only one cutter engaged in a machining
operation :it any time and that H has not been compatible
\H'I‘. automatic work :nange and transfer mechanisms.

If an MC ”rattotinliy" can be thrown into a production
itne represented by a :ranst'er line that is very strong on these
ptz-irits. the features of the two systems will be brought into
full play. raising the system flexibility and resulting in a
rational distribution of ATC and AWC. The net result is the
creation of .t machining system of high productivity that
can perform simultaneously numerous machining operations

by using numerous tools.

Again. there are many items whose productivity and accuracy
can be raised much higher by macluning them in two to three
processes. employing separate machines rather than by machin-
ing them wrth a single MC which overly consolidates the
process. Hence the idea of employing a number of machining
centers simultaneously has come to be accepted.

For this purpose. however. conventional MC's are built
wnli too much emphasis on their multt-use features so that
they can be used over a wide range of applications, and this
very emphasis is reﬂected adversely in some ways and with
poor performance in terms of economics.

Consequently. development of MC's which are not just
general purpose or for exclusive use. but have functions that
are ltighly capable of coping with variations in use as the
situation and purpose demand is sought.

As for machining accuracy. no particularly high values
were demanded of .‘vlC's. partly because they were originally
developed for machuiing of parts produced in small quantities
and that were complex in shape. For a long time. a tolerance
of :10 to 12.5umi0.w05 inch which is up to ten times or
so the error of positioning with a jig boring machine was
accepted.

Among the reasons for this are the following: That a
milulll'llng center is a Kind of automated machine tool and
thus basically machining accuracy is lower than a manually-
operated machine requiring attendance of an operator at all
times by the order or one digit: that the emphasis in the
development of machining centers was placed in the increase
In the operating rate beginning with reduced downtime and
manpower reduction; and the development of equipment for
inspecting machintng accuracy of complex shapes of parts
machined.

However. at present downtime is not so much of a problem.
and owing to the ease with which machining accuracy of
parts having complex configurations has come to be tested
through the widespread use of three-dimensional measuring
instruments. foundations for increased precision in machining
by machining centers have been laid.

0n the other hand. as for rotational accuracy of the main
shaft that ts the dectsrve factor in raising precision. the accuracy
of evcn a main shaft mounted on ball bearing supports can
be maintained below loum and the accuracy of the main
shaft mounted on a fluid bearing support can be easily main~
named below 0. lum.

As for thermal displacement which is considered to be
the ptirtcipai cause of lowered accuracy and coming from
mechanical structure. not only analytical and rational designing
methods Euve come to be used widely but also the method
as shown at FigJ tn which by using a mechanical structure

directly as a part of a heat pipe. a thermal equiy'alency is
obtained while the generated heat is discharged. has come
to be put to practical use. With incorporation of such measures.
the stability of machining accuracy has been further raised.

Moreover. MC's built for use. not as general-purpose
machines but as machines used in production lines of lirttited
scope and purpose. will be required to have much higher
levels of the stability of aosuracy. and this requirement will
work to further raise the accuracy of machining centers.

Finally. automatic measuring instruments for meaniring
work. or the present level of technical sophistication incor-
porated in machining centers will lose their main functions
once the stability or' mechanical accuracy increases to the

levels of 3 to Sum. Some of these instrument: will become
unnecessary because post process mamrement will satisfy
the requirements for controlling machining acaaracy. and
some will develop as more sophisticated compound machines
provided with the functions of machining and inspection by
using the mechanical structure of the M? itself as a 3-dimen-
sionai measuring instrument and by incorporating the process
oi” machining — inspection - correctional machining — inspection.

MC‘s are meeting a turning point in development. and
the direction is away from their use as a single unit machining
center towards their use-as machines for use in production
lines. as is represented by FMS. With it. machining accuracy
is expected to increase from the current levels of sloum to

: 5 down to :3um.and with it. the kinds of automatic measure-
ments required will see great changes.

Introduction

High energy and large output of an electron linear accelerator
(referred as to an electron linac) enables us. a wide variety of
research and development programmes. such as for medical
treatment for cancer by pions. material study by synchroton
radiation. or super LS] technology. With its own design and
purely domestic technology. the Electrotechnical Laboratory
(ETL). starting from April. i980. completed building an energy-
saving type SOOMeV electron lime in six months introduc~
ing a multiputpose. highly efﬁcient system.

Permission. based on the Radioisotope Law. for use was
granted by the Science and Technology Agency on December
:2. i980 and successful beam acceleration was achieved the
same day. Performance was almost that expected to be ob.
tained later tn January. i981.

The electron linac is larger than the 300MeV at Tohoitu
University and is as shown Ill Fig.l. and its maximum electron
enery. electron beam power. and duty cycle are all the highest
in Japan at present. The output is one of the highest in the
world. The total length of the accelerator is about 80m and it is
installed in an accelerator room about IOOm long 6m under.

assignment and played a big role in its success. The electron
linac ts the product of integration of high microwave power
precision processing. and super-high vacuum technologiea and
systems engineering. The recent progress of large power
klystrons has enhanced the economy and safety of an electron
lineac. leading to extensive use of lines: ill many ﬁelds such as
for scientiﬁc. industrial. and medical technlogies. According
to this tendency. an electron ltnac of larger output has been
required. Hence. when ETL decided to move to Tsukuba
Research and Educational City m l97l. ll planned the con-
struction of a large scale electron lime and started to work on
its basic design. The characteristics of the ET), linac described
pretrtously. are those that were designed and planned for con-
struction during the period of I973 to I974.

are made double wtth bioclrs to prevent condensation forming.

(4) Air-conditioning of the accelerator room ts of a closed
circulation type except for in emergencies. The 100m long
accelerator room functions as a feed air duct and the area
below the ﬂoor of the room as the return duct. Air returning
from the accelerator room is first cleaned with water and then
passes through a ﬁlter for removal of morsture by citiued water.
andftnally fed back to the accelerator room.

(5) it' any water leakage should take place in the accelerator
room or laboratory. it is temporarily accumulated in a reservoir
for further processing.

(6) Cooling water for the accelerator and experimental equip-
ment is in a closed circulation type system. Temperature control
for the accelerating sections is kept at 40e0.l°C and even if
thinnedout operation of the electron beam from the low or
midllle enemy section is run by pulse deﬂection. each ac-
celerating section of the low. middle. and high energy sections
can have controlled temperature at 40:0.l'C according to its
respective duty cycle.

(7) Elevators and cranes are properly positioned for easy
access to the accelerator room 6m underground and the
laboratories at the time of delivery, installation. and adjust«
ment oi“ heavy machinery. and to improve ﬂexibility and safety
of the personnel engaged in experiments. The use of these
elevators and cranes is one of the reasons why such large ex-
perimental equipment could be constructed in an incredibly
short period of only six months by a small number of people
and without any accidents.

(8) The doors of the accelerator room and each laboratory
are equipped with a door and key interlock feature.Unless
each door is closed and locked by key. beam acceleration is
impossible. The control console includes a door open/close and
lock display panel so that the operator can monitor these
conditions. in addition. CCTV ts specially installed in the ac-
celerator room for constant monitoring.

4. Electron Linac

As shown in Fig.3. the accelerating section that accelerates
the electrons is conﬁgured with pure copper disks each with

a hole. and which are titted in a pure copper tube having an
inside diameter of about 8cm. The disks are spaced at intervals
of 35cm (one-third the wavelength of 28$6MHz microwave).
These holed disks work to adjust the phase speed of micro-
waves to light velocity. or to create a strong electric ﬁeld (Ti-{01
made) in an axial direction required for electron acceleration.
Electron injection to the accelerating section is made by an
injector consisting of an electron gun. an electron power supply.
an electron pulse modulator. an inﬂector. a prebuncher. and a
buncher. The speed of the electrons injected at about iOOkeV
by the electron gun. is at 55% light velocity and it is ac-
celerated to about IMeV at the exit of the buncher where it
reaches 94% light velocity. The incident electrons to the ac-
celerating section with this speed are accelerated in a strong
electric ﬁeld anally travelling wrrh liyit velocity. but the

electron speed is only close to light velocity. 99.5% at SMeV IlNo’ml we

or 99.99003 at SOOMeV and only the electron mass is in-
creastng by relativtstrc effect.

The electrons are accelerated In .I strong electric ﬁeld on the
axis ot‘ the holed disks. and the electric tield range as shown
in (bi ot’ Fig.3 indicates the alternate direction of the ﬁeld along
the axis. Some of the electrons that are injected to the accelerat-
ing section are accelerated if they are at a certain phase. but
others are deaccelerated. Thus. it is necessary that injection can
be made at a suitable phase for acceleration at the stage of the
injector. If the injected electrons at about lOOlteV from the
gun passes through the cavity gap of the prebuncher. the
electrons that pass early. centering around a certatn phase are
deaccelerated and ones that pass later are accelerated by
pertodically changtng the electrtc ﬁeld at 2856MH1. When the
utstartce of about 30cm to the buncher is run. the electron
ﬂow becomes a discontinuous range and turns to the flow of
electron bunches that are gathered in a phase interval of about
oO' - electron bunches that continue of intervals of IOSmm.
In addition. an individual electron bunch becomes a part of a
bunch wrthtn 4' (corresponding to slightly above lm in
length) at the exit of the buncher with about 46cm in length
(travelling wave type — Vp/c-0.75 to I. la!) mode. constant
impedence type). These electron bunches reach the highest
energy through acceleration ot the largest electric ﬁeld by ad-
juﬂmg the microwave phase of cach accelerating secrion.

While an electron ts being accelerated in an accelerating
section. it generates backward microwaves (mainly harmonic
components hating about 1.5 ttmes the microwave input fre-
quency) and the lateral electric ﬁeld in the HEM“ mode takes
place. which is shown in (b) 0! Fig.3. This lateral oscillation is
further ampliﬁed by multistage acceleration by a number of
accelerating sections and reduces the electron beam striking the
holed dtslts in the accelerating seetton. ETL has developed the
following stnrcture and arrangement for the accelerating sections
tn order to restrain the Beam Bloonp (BBU) effect.

(I) To malt: the operating distance between the HEMll
mode in the accelerating section and the electron beam asshort

TEC, FOUR OTHEIS TO PARTICIPATE IN LIBYAN PLANT TENDER
Tokyo JAPAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL in English Vol 19 No 980, 10 Nov 81 p 6

[Text] Toyo Engineering Corp and four other Japanese enterprises will form a
consortium in joining an international fertilizer plant tender scheduled to
open in Libya early next year.

The Libyan Government will invite tenders in mid-January, 1982 to construct
a big fertilizer complex, comprising anunnia, urea and phosphoric acid plants,
worth some 80 billion yen.

TEC and the four--Chiyoda Chemical Engineering 5 Construction Co., Kobe Steel,
Itd., Marubeni Corp. and Hitsui 6 Co.--have started preparations to participate
in the Libyan tender.

By going hand in hand, the quintet aims at dispersing "country risks" which are
liable to be incurred in deals and/or projects in developing countries.

They also judge that joint participation by plural enterprises in a worldwide
bidding will work more favorable for them than in case of a single firn's
participation to receive export insurance from the Japanese Government, even if
everything goes wrong for political or other reasons.

Sources said that TEC, representing the Japanese team, will offer to undertake
the construction of a urea plant, with Chiyoda and Kobe taking charge of ammonia
and phosphoric acid facilities, respectively.

FAST DEVELOPMENT OF 'PINE BUILDINGS' DISCUSSED

Tokyo DIAMOND'S INDUSTRLA in English Nov 81 pp 25-26

[Text]

iapan's big general constructors are
now placing emphasis on the construc-
tion of "fine buildings." Production
plants for le (integrated circuits) and
LSls (large scale integration circuits)
are being built one after another.
The manufacture of these semiconduc-
tors requires an extremely clean room
free from vibrations and with a
constant temperature and humidity.
The requirements are so rigid that high
technology is needed to design and
build the plant facilities. General con-
structors call production plants of this
kind "ﬁne buildings."

In the United States, the air purity
of the clean room is measured by the
number of particles larger than 0.5
microns contained in one cubic foot of
air. The manufacture of JK bit le is
said to require the air purity of :00
and that of 64K bit LSls needs 40.
The place that can meet the require-
rrents is called a clean room. Takasago
Thermal Engineering Co., which holds
the top share in this field, says that in
lacan many firms are trying to reduce
the size of particles to measure :Iean-
liness up to 0.1 microns instead of
0.5 microns and that the maximum
:er'misslble viorations are also measur-
ed by the unit of microns. and the
standard for LSls is set at 0.3‘05
microns. Building a worishoo that can
meet the r-g:d specifications affects
the designing and construczion work

89

of the entire building that will house
the clean room.

While investments in building con-
struaion have been sumac: in both
public and private sectors, those in
building IC and LSI production
facilities are increasing at a rapid
pace. Rapid advances in lC and LSl
technology are intensifying competi-

JDB REPORTS PRODUCTION FACILITIES AGING

Tokyo JAPAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL in English Vol 19 No 981. 17 Nov 81 p 3

[Text]

Production facilities in Japan
swtltly are becoming super-
annuated. and there is anger
of the nation's international
competitiveness declining in
thenearluture.

This is according to the
Japan Development Banlt on
the basis at its latat survey

JDB says that the adverse

eltects ot‘ sluggish plant and-

equtpment investrnem alter the
first oil crunch have begun to
surface. and the average age of
manufacturing equipment
iyears otusei hasgmntobe
an years. or 1.5 years lower
than seven years ago.

In contrast, it notes that
manulacturing tacitltis in the
11.8. lately have begun toshow
sums of becotntng younger
alter earlier being about three
years older than those in
Japan. As a result. it says that
age gap between those in Japan
and the U5. has narrowed to
around one year.

JDB thus feels it is urgent
tor Japanese enterprises swttt-
ly to uwate their manutactur-
mg equipment.

Private plant and equipment
investment in Japan began
recovering from fiscal ma.
Prospects are also that capital
expenditure in the manulactur-
tng sector in liscal Ml will
show a 12.7 per cent yearly
increase.

Monday that the conpany had begin to operate an alnost fully auto-stud plant

in Aichi Prefecture. The plant. called a flexible Ianufacturing factory, can
do processing jobs with 12 workers, conpared with the previous 250 workers
required at a conventional plant of the sane capacity. President Teruyuki
Yanazaki of the Althl Prefecture-based nachine tool builder said, "The new

PM factory ranks the highest level in the world as an umsnnsd factory." The
in factory is equipped with 18 nechining syat- (couqosed of nachining centers
and peripheral equipnent). two unattended feeding nachines (carrying work
pieces for nachines processing) and one drl- crane robot. All of these systole
are controlled by six sicroproceasors. It operates cowletely autonetically
during eight nidnight hours. Hhile planning to preview the m factory as a

MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC SOLAR Grill—Mitsubishi Electric Corp. has developed a
gallium arsenide solar cell having a light-to-electricity conversion rate of

18 per cent at 1 volt of electric pressure. The photovoltaic efficiency rate

is alnost double the highest level so far attained by conventional silicon solar
cells. Mitsubishi has been developing cm solar cells at its 1.8! Development
Laboratory at ltami, Nyogo Pref. for three years. It hopes to apply the newly
developed batteries to Japan's furure artificial satellites. According to
Mitsubishi, galliun arsenide has been under study in many countries as a potential
swstitutc for silicon to make seniconductors and solar cells. Collin arsenide
has various advantages, including quicker electron passage, but it still poses
problems, including less strength than silicon, requiring a thicker structure
for application. [Text] [Tokyo JAPAN EOONGJIC JOURNAL in English Vol l9 No 979,
