RATIONAL USE OF NATURAL GAS -- AN IMPORTANT TASK OF THE TENTH FIVE-YEAR PLAN
Moscow PROHYSHLENNAYA ENERGETIKA in Russian No 10. Oct 78 pp 12-16

[Article by c. I. Ibragimov. engineer. Moscow Territorial Inspection of
Gosgaznadzor]

[Text] Natural gas. as an economic form of fuel. is extensively used in many
areas of production. and is conducive to an increase in labor productivity.
attainment of high efficiency in technological processes and a reduction in
the specific expenditures of fuel. A reliable supply of high-quality fuel to
the national economy requires an increase in gas recovery and more efficient
use of gas. In this connection. an important pert is played by the technical-
economic indices of operation of heat and power equipment. The Moscow Terri-
torial Inspection of Gosgasnadzor SSSR carries out direct supervision over
rational utilization of gas, adherence to strict measures of economy and
elimination of losses of gas during consumption.

work on economy of fuel-energy resources in enterprises and organizations is
being done in areas of reducing losses in heating networks. rationalizing
technological processes. introducing new equipment and updating old equipment.
more complete utilization of secondary heat. improvement of normalization. and
supervising rational expenditure of thermal energy. Each year industrial
enterprises work out plans for organizational-technical measures to satisfy
the confirmed quotas on saving of energy resources. Fuel and thermal energy
are economized every year by the collectives of the Stankolit Plant. the

Serp i Holst Plant and the Lyublin foundry. For instance in 1977 the Serp i
Holst Plant saved 1.5 million cu. m of gas and 3148 Goal of thermal energy.

Practice has shown that where the management of an enterprise, the Party.
Komsomol and trade union organizations are at the head of creative initiative
of workers and engineering-technical personnel and wage a daily battle for
technical progress. the introduction of leading experience. perfection of

the organization of labor and production. the internal reserves of production
are most fully utilized and higher indices with respect to economy of energy
resources are attained. At the same time. the proper concern is not being
given to this important matter in a number of enterprises. In many factories
and plants there are shortcomings in the use of natural gas. wastage of fuel.
nonproductive losses of thermal energy.

A check made in 1977 showed that 31 out of 266 Moscow enterprises (the
Central Motion Picture Studio of Children‘s and Young People‘s films imeni

h. Gor'kiy. Furniture Factory No 3,the Hossel'mssh Plant and others) are not
using such an important reserve of fuel savings as utilization of the heat of
combustion products, and the economizars installed on boilers are not working
in ten enterprises (the Technical Pilot Plant imeni Klara Tsctkiya. Wool '
Spinning Plant No 14 and others). The temperature of the departing gases
after the boilers in these enterprises reaches 300°C. which leads to overuse
of fuel and a 6-61 reduction.in boiler efficiency.

-0ne of the methods of improving efficiency in the use of natural gas is to

do regime-adjustment tests on gas-using facilities with preparation of regime
charts. This enables operation of equipment with optimum parameters and
minimum gas consumption. However, it has been established in the course of
inspection that such work has not been done in 106 industrial enterprises of
Moscow (the RTI-z Plant, the Kauchuk Production Association. the Csrding
Factory imeni the Seventh Anniversary of the October Revolution and others).
while in 26 enterprises (the October Streetcar Depot, Furniture Combine No 3
and others) the gas-using facilities are being operated with considerable

deviations from the regime charts due to the lack of skill on the part of
service personnel.

One of the bottlenecks in operation of gas-using equipment is that boilers

are not equipped with automatic gas analyzers that determine the carbon
dioxide content or oxygen content in combustion products. Without such gas
analyzers it is practically impossible to make a reliable check on the

quality of gas combustion and adherence to the working conditions of equipment.
The check showed that automatic gas analyzers are lacking in 110 industrial
enterprises (the Lyublin Fruit and Vegetable Office, the Goznsk Printing

Plant and others). while a considerable number of installed gas analyzers are
not in operation in 62 enterprises (the Beskudnikovskiy Construction material
and Structural Element Combine No l. the Technical Articles Plant and others).

Automation of the control of combustion processes should play a large part
in normalizing the operation of gas-using equipment. However, it has been
established that 77 industrial enterprises (the Technical Photoplate Plant.
the Carding Factory and others) lack automatic equipment for combustion
control, while the equipment in 38 enterprises (the Krasnyy Proletariy
Printing Plant, Tool Plant No S of the Hoszhilpromsnsb Trust and others)

is not operating. The combustion of gas in antiquated equipment leads to
considerable losses. Antiquated;uneconomicsl boilers (with efficiency of
60-80!) are being used in 55 enterprises of the city (the Port Refrigeration
Combine, the Krasnyy Put' Machine Plant and others), resulting in a loss of
up to 101 in fuel burned.

At the Trolleybus Repair Plant. the Experimental Glass Plant and elsewhere
no account is kept of fuel expenditure and thermal energy produced. so that
the actual specific norms of fuel consumption cannot be determined. However,

2

these enterprises systematically put in a report on satisfaction of the norms
for gas consumption on form ll-sn thus distorting the State report.

The measure of consumption of energy resources is the norm for fuel con-
sumption established for units of measurement of goods produced. The tech-
nically and economically substantiated norms should correspond to the current
level of leading technology and organization of production, and stimulate
workers and collectives of enterprises to find reserves of economy of fuel
and energy resources. In this connection there must be an appreciable
increase in the role of methodical work on normalizing fuel and energy
resources on all levels of management of the national economy.

It should be noted that a number of ministries and agencies are not keeping
good track of the use of fuels in subordinate enterprises, and sometimes _
approve overstated norms. For instance the specific norms of fuel consumption
are overstated in a number of enterprises of the Ministry of the Heat and
Dairy Industry of the USSR: at the Ochakovskiy Dairy Plant -- by 9.9 kg of
ideal fuel per Gcal (leading to an overconsumption of 1 million cu. m of gas
per year), at the Moscow Poultry Combine -- by 17 kg per Gcsl (the over-
consumption of gas amounts to about 0.5 million.cu. m per year). In many
enterprises (the fruit and vegetable bases of Baumanskiy, Proletarskiy and
other rayons) there are no technically substantiated norms of fuel con-
sumption.

Economy of fuel and energy resources depends to a consderable extent on the
development and implementation of specific measures to save fuel (gas).
However. such measures have not been worked out at the Dzerahinskiy Fruit
and Vegetable Office. at the Technical Photoplete Plant and elsewhere.

Installed at the Osvobozhdennyy Trud Fine Fabric Factory and the weaving and
finishing combine in the Burevestnik Production Association are up-to-date
type DKVR-6.S-l3 boilers that according to plan should be equipped with
automatic equipment, instruments and utilizers of the heat of combustion
products. It was established by the check that utilizers are not installed
on the boilers (this leads to overconsumption of gas. and to a 4-62 reduction
in boiler efficiency). automatic equipment for combustion regulation is
lacking. the quality of fuel combustion is not being monitored. and no account
is being kept on the thermal energy produced and used. Each year in these
enterprises there is an overconsumption of about 1 million cu. m of gas
(400,000. 600,000 and 150,000 cu. m respecitvely [sic]). The same pattern

is observed at the Auto Repair Plant No 2 and the Experimental Pilot Metal
Plant, where overconrumption amounts to about 300,000 cu. m of gas per year,
or 8-10! of the yearly consumption of gas by these enterprises. The Auto
Repair Plant No 2 has not even worked out plans for organizational-technical
steps to conserve fuel and thermal energy.

At Refrigerator No 9 the instruments that account for the amount of heat
produced by the boilers and that determine the temperature and composition

3
FOR OPVICIAL USE ONLY
of the departing gas are not working. there is no automated equipment for
regulating processes of gns combustion. regime-adjustment tests are not
being done on the DKVR-6.5-i3 boiler. and heat is being lost on uninsulated
sections of the steam lines. The enterprise has not worked out specific
norms of fuel consumption on the production of thermal energy. Losses of
gas amount to 5-62 of the annual consumption.

The examples of wasteful use of gas turned up by the Inspection as well as
the violations of discipline in gas consumption at industrial enterprises
have been examined regularly by the Hunicipai People‘s Control Committee

and at sessions of the Moscow Gorispolkom. Nevertheless, the directors of a
number of enterprises have not taken the necessary steps. For instance a
repeated check has shown that Refrigeration Combine No 8, the Ochakovskiy
Dairy Plant. the Udsrnitsa Candy Factory and Refrigeration Plant No 12 have
not carried out a number of directives made by the Inspection in 197‘. The
insufficient attention given by enterprise directors to work on saving fuel
resources is the basic reason for shortcomings in the use of natural gas.

A definite daily norm for fuel consumption is now being set up for every
enterprise. The Derebenevskiy and Kuskovskiy Chemical Plants. the Beskudni-
kovskiy Construction Material and Structural Element Combine No l and others
are exceeding their mean daily and weekly limits.

Under conditions of constant increase in gas consumption and remoteness of
consumers from the sources of supply it is important to observe discipline
in gas consumption and to increase efficiency in the use of gas. The main

areas for improving efficiency in the use of natural gas in industrial
enterprises are:

. preventive maintenance of gas-using and heat-using equipment. as well as
regime-adjustment work and gas combustion in strict conformity with regime
charts (the possible fuel savings is 3-5: of the annual consumption of gas
by enterprises);

introducing systems for automatic regulation of combustion with correction
for the composition of combustion products (possible savings l-bl);

effective utilization of the heat of departing gases. and also hear of
low-parameter steam (possible savings 6-81);

reducing heat losses by improving the insulation of pipelines and heat-using
equipment (possible savings 10-152):

changing the heating systems of enterprises from steam to hot water (possible
savings 3-62):

reconstructing and improving heat supply systems. automating and regulating
heating and ventilation systems (possible savings 10-122);
roe-orrtciu. use ONLY

increasing the collection and improving the utilization of condensate
(possible savings 5-101); '

replacing or updating antiquated, low-capacity and unproductive gas-using
equipment (possible savings 5-101).

Facing the directors of enterprises and organizations in the Tenth Five-Year
Plan are great problems on mobilizing all reserves of savings of energy
resources and accounting for their consumption. In industry, more than

30% of the total savings of boiler and furnace fuel is to be realized by
introducing new equipment and improving the economy of equipment now in use,
perfecting and intensifying technological processes, introducing power-
technological processes with a sisultaneous increase in the unit power of
facilities, perfecting gas-burner devices. autoaating production processes
and using secondary energy resources. Expansion of the voluaes of utilization
of secondary energy resources will save about 18 nillion aetric tons of
ideal fuel in 1980 as compared with 1975. The national economic value of
using secondary energy resources in industry lies both in fuel savings and
in a considerable reduction in material and labor inputs on extraction and
transportation of fuel.

During the Tenth Five-Year Plan there is to be an increase in the output of
utilization equipment and spare parts for it. extensive use of evaporative
cooling systens on high steam parameters in industrial furnaces of ferrous
and nonferrous metallurgy and the chemical industry, and use of secondary

energy resources in agencies for heat supply to industrial and residential
areas.

[Text] Deposits of the Northern European USSR

Petroleum. gas. and gas condensate deposits have been discovered in the
Koai ASSR. the Nenets Autonoaous District. and Arkhangel'skaya Oblast of
the Northern European USSR.

This petroleum-gas region is located in the Tinan-Pechora region. which
encompasses a vast area bounded by the Ural and Pay-Khoy uplifts in the
east, the Polyudova Kannya uplift in the south, and the Tilan Ridge in
the west (see Figure 1 below). The first pool of heavy crude oil found
in the Pechora petroleumpgas region was confined to the Chibyusskaya
Series of the Middle Devonian.

The Yaregskoye Deposit h
This deposit began to be worked in 1933. In 1939 extraction by the
underground shaft lethod was begun; in 1953 well drilling draining
layers on a 12-15 aster grid was introduced. The oil pool covered a
vast area. 533 extrelely long (260-300 kilometers), and was worked by
several shafts. "

The conpdiition of the petroleua gases froa this despoit was studied in
detail for shafts Nos 1. 2. and 3.

The studies established that the petroleua gases of the Yaregskoye deposit
are dry methane gases. They have a methane concentration of 95-98 percent
with 0.1-2.0 percent nitrogen. 0.7-2.5 percent carbon dioxide, and no hy-
drogen sulfide. Among the homologues of methane the gases contain small
amounts of ethane, propane. and higher Iolecular hydrocarbons.

The composition of the gas differs little at different sites in the shafts.
There is some variation in content of carbon dioxide; the concentration of
C02 is greater (up to two percent) in the gases of the old, worked sectors
of the pool and less in the gases from the new drilled wells and boreholes.

The gases from petroleum shaft No 3. which was put into operation later
than Nos 1 and 2, contain more ho-ologues of methane and nitrogen.

The composition of the petroleum gas of the Yaregskoye deposit given off
into the atmosphere during degassing to atmospheric pressure is shown in

the data contained in Table 6 (next page).

The composition of the residual dissolved gas is: Ch -- 97.8 percent;

0 u -- 0.18; ‘33“ -- 0.07; c‘n -- 0.02; c5 and higher -- 0.02; 112 -- 1.1;
1.306002 -- 0.7 pegcent. There 19 about 0.05 cubic meters per ton of this
gas.

These composition of petroleum gases from the Yaregskoye deposit illustrate
that the gases of gas pools are not the only source of dry methane gases.

In addition to the Yaregskoye petroleum deposit. the only deposit in the
Soviet Union where petroleum was extracted by the shaft method, pools of
heavy crude oil containing small amounts of dissolved gas were worked in
the Chelbasskoye deposit in the Ukhta and Troitsko-Pechora region.

In subsequent years various large deposits were discovered and worked in
this region. Among these deposits were the Sed'-Iol'skoye gas deposit
(1935); the petroleun-ges deposits of Voy-Vozh (1963), Nibel' (1945),
Verhhneoarinskoye and Niahneomrinskoye (1949, 1950), Nyemedskoye (1947),
Kush-Xodshskoye (1949), and Dzhebol'skoye (1956); the petroleum deposits
of Zapadno-Tebukskoye (1959). Lem'yusskoye (1960), Hichayusskoye (1961).
Vostdchno-Savinoborskoye (1961). and Usinskoye (1962); the gas deposits
of Pechorogorodskoye (1965), Pechorokozhevenskoye (196A). and others.

For a long time the Pechora petroleum-gas province was worked as a petro-
leum region. In the last decade. however, the large Vuktyl'skoye gas
condensate deposit has been discovered in this region.

The northern part of the province has not been adequately studied. Host

of the deposits are located in the southern part of the Ishma-Pechora
basin.

In this region industrially feasible gas and petroleum has been identified
in beds of the Devonian. Carboniferous, and Perlian systems.

In the Devonian beds the following productive horizons have been identified
in the Poddomanikov stratum: III, II, Iv, Ib, and Is. The carbonate rocks

of the Zadonsko-Yelets strata of the Pilenskiy Stage and the Ukhta strata
of the Pranskiy Stage also contain gas.

Industrially feasible gas in Lower Permian carbonate rock has been proven
at the Vuktyl'skoye gas condensate deposite, which is located in the Sub-
Ural trough, where Carboniferous carbonate rocks are also productive.

The Vuktyl'skoye Deposit

This gas condensate deposit. located 150 kilometers from the city of Ukhta.
occurs in a large asymmetric anticlinal fold.

The pool is identified in carbonate bade of the Lower Permian and Upper.
Middle. and Lower Carboniferous. The productive layer has interiayering
of limestone with dolomite and dolomitized limestone. Terrigeneus beds.
chiefly argillites. form some interlayere and play a significant part
in the beds of the Verkhnekartinskiy Suhatage of the Lower Permian and
the Yasnopolyenekiy Horizon of the Lower Carboniferous.

The Vuktyl pool is a massive type with alternating zones of different
collection characteristics and productivity.

The microfracturee in the traps of the deposit join the entire carbonate
mass into a single hydrodynamic system.

The initial layer pressure at the 3,025 meter marker was 370 kilogram-
force per square centimeter; the temperature was 62 degrees c.

The gases of the Vuktyl'skoye deposit contain up to nine percent ethane.
about two percent propane, more than one percent other homologues of
methane. 5-7 percent nitrogen. and 0.1 percent carbon dioxide. There is
no hydrogen sulfide in the gases.

Layer pressure is not maintained during working of the deposit; during
the period that it has been worked the layer pressure has dropped greatly.

Tne composition of the gas extracted at the Vuktyl'skoye deposit is
shown in Table 7 (next page).

Low-temperature separation units are used at the Vultyl field to remove
hydrocarbon condensate and moisture from the gas up to a temperature of
dew point minus 10 degrees c.

The unstable condensate, degassed at 25 kilogram-force per square centimeter,
is transported by a condensate line to a gen refinery where it is stabilized
and the hydrocarbons are separated out. The refinery produces products for
market and feeds gas into the gas transport system.

The gas has excellent market characteristics with respect to heat or burn-
ing and a complete absence of sulfur-containing compounds. as well as low
levels of coz. The top heat of burning of market gas from the
Vyktyl'skoye deposit is 8.900 gigacalories per cubic meter (at 20 degrees
Q. and 760 millimeters mercury column).

The composition of the gas delivered from the Vuktyl field to the trunk
gas pipeline is shown in Table 8 (page after next).

deposit contain hydrogen sulfide (0.1-0.2 percent) and 3.3 percent carbon
dio’id. s

The hydrocarbon composition of gas from well No l of the Kunshinskoye
deposit. shown below in percentages. is close to that of the
Vaneyvisskoye deposit:

The gas has a density of 0.637 relative to air and its lowest heat of
burning is 7.890 gigacalories per cubic actor.

The Pechorogorodskoye Deposit

This deposit sits on the floodplain of the Pechors River near the set-
tlesent of Krasnyy Yer. It is confined to an anticlinnl fold with a
westerly strike.

Gas occurs in beds of the Lower Carboniferous and Upper Persian at the
deposit. The productive horizons of the Lower Carboniferous
(Yasnopolysnskiye beds) lie at a depth of 1.060-1.070 meters and have a
layer pressure of 112 kilogram-force per square centiaeter.

The gas in the Upper Perndan beds lies at a depth of 660-650 meters with
a layer pressure of about 58 kilogram-force per square centiaeter.

The cosposition of the gas of the Lower Carboniferous pool is close to
the composition of gases fro. the Vyktyl'skoye deposit with high levels
of ethane (about nine percent). propane (up to four percent). and butane
and higher for-a (up to two percent).

The gases contain about eight percent nitrogen and 0.2 percent carbon
dioxide.

The gases fro. the Upper Per-den beds belong to the ssthane type with
a low content of lethane hosologues (see Table 9 below).

The Deposits of Western Siberia

Gas, gas condensate, petroleum-gas, and petroleum deposits have been dis-
covered in Western Siberia. in Tyumenskaya, Tomskaya, and Novosibirsksya
oblasts and Krasnoyarskiy Kray. They are located within the western
Siberian lovland, an enormous bowl-shaped basin bounded by folded forms-

tions on the vest, east, and south and running to the Arctic Ocean region
in the north.

This region encompasses the vast territory from the eastern spurs of the
Ural Range in the west to the Yenisey River in the east. from the shores
of the Arctic Ocean in the north to the folded formations of Kazakhstan
and the Altay in the south.

The primary petroleum and gas presence in this region occurs in Mesozoic
beds; seven petroleum-gas strata are identified in the cross-section.

The Lower and Middle Jurassic petroleum-gas stratum lies at the base of
the Mesozoic-Cenozoic platform mantle of the Hestern Siberian platform

plate. unconformably and showing erosion, covering the basement forma-
tions and intermediate complex.

The stratum has an alternation of argillites, aleurolites, and sandstones
that accumulated under conditions of fresh-water, seacoast, and marine
facies. The seacoast and marine facies are developed only in the top

parts of the stratum in the central regions and through almost the entire
cross-section of the northern and northeastern regions.

FOR ' ... USE ONLY

The Upper Jurassic petroleum-gas stratus lies comformably on Middle
Jurassic rocks in the eastern and southern parts of the lowland. but
there is a small interruption in sediment accumulation in the rest of
the region.

The stratum consists of marine argillites in the western half of the low-
land end seacoest sandstones in the eastern part. The southern part has
multicolored lagoon sediments. primarily argillaceous. The stratum tends
to be thicker toward the margins of the lowland and toward the northeast.
In the northern half of the lowland the beds are sarine and seacoast

- argillaceous rocks with sandstone intarlayers.

The permeable rocks in the Upper Jurassic beds. with the exception of
the northern and northeastern regions. are hydrodynamically connected
to the underlying Middle Jurassic sediments.

The Lower and liiddla Valanginian petroleum-gas stratum lies conformably
on Upper Jurassic beds. The stratum is composed principally of marine
argillaceous rocks. Sand layers are found in some places. The thickness
of the Lower and Middle Vslsnginian beds increases gradually as one moves
from the margins of the lowland toward the center.

The Upper Valanginian petroleum-gas stratum lies conformably on Middle
Valanginian rocks everywhere in the lowland except the southeastern part.
This stratum is composed of merinabeds in the southern regions. primarily
sand beds. and of argilleceous beds in the west. The thickness of the
stratum increases as one moves from the margins toward the center and
also in the northern part of the lowland.

The Goteriv-larremisn and, in part. Aptian petroleumogas strata lie on

top Valanginian rocks. The beds are composed of sandstones. sleurolites,
and clays. In the southern and southeastern regions of the lowland multi-
colored sand-clay sediments are developed. while marine argillaceous
rocks occur in the western part. The thickness of the beds increases as
one moves from the periphery toward the center of the lowland.

The Aptian-Albian-Cenomenian petroleum-gas stratum lies conformably on

the beds below it. It is composed of an alternation of clays. slauro-
lites. and sandstones with the last-named predominating. Continental and
eeacoast sediments of the Pokurskaya Series occur over most of the terri-
tory. changing to multicolored beds in the south and replaced by marine and
seacoast sediments in the west. The thickness of the stratum increases as
one moves from the periphery toward the center.

The Upper Cretaceous (without the Cenomanian) petrolsurgas stratum lies
conformably on Aptian-Albian-Cenomanian sediments and is comosed of ergil-
laceous and siliceous-argillaceous rocks. Sandy varieties appear in the
eastern and southern regions. The thickness of the stratum increases as
one moves from the margins toward the center of the lowland.

Structural uplifts are extensively developed throughout the platfors.
The density of large structural uplifte increases toward the center of
the platforl and in the northern regions.

In terns of coepoeition. the natural gases of the Western Siberian depos-
its are heterogeneous and differ by content of hydrocarbons, nitrogen
and (:02 as wall as by gas condensate characteristics.

These differences appear especially significantly on a regional scale and
. in the cross-section of productive horisone at the deposits. Based on

the territorial arrangeuent of deposits and their characteristics. the
deposits that have been discovered fore the northern region and the
western region.

1. The Northern Gas Region

This region encospasses the vast territory between the Nadya and 'l'at
rivers and in the Yenieey-Khatanga trough. the region is bounded on

the south by the 63rd parallel: on the west its boundaries are the eastern
epure of the Ural Range north of the city of Saleltharda and follow the

0b' River to the south. .the region stretches to the Khetanga River in

the east.

This region includes the Iain. largest gas deposits and gas condensate
pools.

The industrially feasible gas presence of the region is associated with
Cretaceous and Jurassic beds. The chief productive beds of the Creta-
ceous are the Cenoeanien (Upper Cretaceous) and Valanginian (Lower Creta-
ceous).

The following are the principal deposits that have been explored in the
Northern Gas Region: Urengoyskoye, Hedweih'ye. Zapolyarnoye. ‘l'asovsltoye.

brachyanticlinal fold. The main gas pool lies in Cenounun beds (Upper
Cretaceous) and is confined to the upper part of the sand-clay strata.
which is coeposed of sandstones and aleurolitee intricately interlayered
with clays. The pool is covered by regionally persistent beds. sainly
argillaceous. which are 550-670 esters thick over the deposit.

The gas pool is an arching. layered native type: it is a floating pool
with a water pressure systee. The layer pressure of the pool is 122.5

The nitrogen content of gases from the Cenonanian pool varies by wells
and sectors from 0.6 to 3.7 percent. The highest concentrations of

nitrogen are found in wells in sarginsl parts of the structure and in
the water-gas contact scnes.

asses fron the Cenonanian pool of the Ursngoyshoye deposit can be
transported along trunk pipelines without prelielnary resoval of heavy
hydrocarbons. During industrial processing noisture is removed fro-
the gas and small amounts (0.3 grass per cubic meter) of heavy hydro-

carbons with boiling points of up to 300 degrees c. are separated out
(see Table 19. next page).

In addition to pools in Cane-anion beds the Urengoy region has produc-
tive horisons in Lower Cretaceous (Valanginian) and Jurassic beds (see
Table 20. page after next).

in terns of chemical coeposition. the Valsnginian and Jurassic gases
differ significantly from the Geno-anian gases. The chief difference

is content of heavy hydrocarbons. whose concentrations increase at
depth.

The gases contain gss condensate fractions and high levels of ethane.
propane. and butane which sust be extracted before feeding to the pipe-
line. The hydrocarbons that are reaoved find use as raw eaterisl for

the production of special-purpose products and in the petrochaelcal
industry.

The Hsdvssh'ys Deposit

The Hedveeh'ye gas deposit is e three-dosed structure within the
Nanets arch. which extends in a saw-nus direction.

The pool is 125 hiloeeters long and 13-29 kilometers in width.

The Hedveth'ye-Nydinskaya fold is coeposed of two local uplifts. the
northern or Nydinskoye and the souttrr: :r ﬁcsrczh'ye, which are divided

by a saddle. In its turn. the Hedvech'ye uplift has three sasller struc-
tural features .

The hydinskoye uplift is 33 kilo-stars long and 19 wide; the hedverh'ye
has a length of 86 hiloeeters and a width of 26.

In geological structure and trap characteristics the Hedverh'ye deposit
is sieilar to the Urengoyskoye deposit 125 kiloseters away.

The ﬂedverh'ye deposit was put into experimental industrial operations

in 1972. The Cenoeanian beds contain industrially feasible gas. They
are capped by thick (600-650 esters) beds of Turonian-Paleogenic clays.
The Cenoeanian gas pool is an arched. layered massive pool underlain

by water. The depth of.the roof of the Cenonanian gas pool in the arched
part is l.060—l.2lo seters. The gas layer ranges in thickness from 135

In addition to the gas pools in the Cenonsnien horizon. preduetive hori-
zons have been found at the Hedvesh‘ye deposit in the Lover Cretaceous
Velanginian and Hiddle Jurassic beds.‘

The gases of these horizons differ in composition from the Cenonanian
gases: they are classified as gas condensate for the Valanginian layers
and petroleusrgas in the Jurassic beds.

The Zapolyarnoye Deposit

The Zapolyarnoye gee deposit is located 100 kilometers southeast of the
settlenent of Tasovo. The deposit was discovered in 1965.

The gas-bearing horizons occur in the Turonisn and Cenonanien stages of
the Upper Cretaceous.

The primary gee reserves are found in the Geno-anian beds. The Ceno-
nanian productive horizon lies in a vaulted part at a depth of 1.130
meters and is couposed of interstrstified layers and lenses of sandstone.
aleurolites. and clays. The gas traps are sand-aleurolite rocks. The
Cenonanian beds are overlain by dense Lover Turonian clays about 40
meters thick. The pool is a massive. floating type ‘7 kilo-eters long
and 29 wide with a slight tilt. from 1.308 to 1.315 meters. of the gas-
water contact. The tilt 1. to the northeast. The gas layer is 225
meters thick; initial layer pressure was 133 kilograa-force per square
centileter and the temperature is 34 degrees C.

32
FOR OPTICIAL USE ONtY
The Turonian productive horizon lies 70-100 meters above the Cenonanian
and is composed of alternating aleurolite clays. argillacaous sand-
stones. end sleurolites. It is a layered, arching pool 38 kilometers
long and 20 wide with initial layer pressure of 125.8 kilogram-force
per square centimeter.

The composition of gases from the Zapolyarnoye deposit is shown in
Table as. next page.

The Tazovakoye deposit

The Tazovskoye deposit is located northeast of the Zapolyarnoye deposit.
12 kiloaeters southeast of the settle-ant of Tazovskoye. The deposit
was discovered in 1962.

The Tazovskoye structure is an asymmetric done-like fold, slightly elon-
gated in a northwesterly direction. 28 kilometers long and 16 wide on
the roof of the productive horizon.

The productive beds are Geno-anion, composed of sandy-sleurolite rocks
and overlain by thick (830 meters) Upper Cretaceous beds of clay.

The massive. floating-type gas pool is located in the upper part of the
Geno-anian beds at a depth of l.120-l.165 neters. The layer pressure
is 112.9 kilogram-force per square centineter. The gas horizon is 55
meters thick.

In addition to 53,000 cubic netsrs of gas yield a day from wells, 15-16
cubic meters of petroleum a day has°baen extracted fro. the lower part
of the Geno-anion pool.

The gases of the Censuanien pool of the Tazovskoye deposit have the same
composition as gases identified in Cenomanisn beds at other sites of the
northern group of deposits in the western Siberian Lowland.

The Valsnginisn horizon of the Lower Cretaceous and the Jurassic beds
of the Tazovskoye deposit also contain gas.

The composition of gas from the Valanginian horizon differs from the gas
of the Geno-anion pool in its higher content of homologues of methane

and slightly higher levels of 002 and nitrogen.

Tests of gas fro. the Jurassic beds, which lie lowest, indicate that
the hydrocarbon composition of the gas is still heavier.

Data on the composition of gases from the productive layers of the
Tazovskoye deposit are given in Tables 25 and 26 below.

The Novoportovskoye Deposit

The Novoportovskoye gas condensate deposit is located in the northwestern
part of the Northern Group of Deposits, on the Yanal Peninsula 290 kilo-

seters northeast of the city of Salekharda. The deposit was discovered
in 1964.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
The Nuvoportovskoye uplift in a northveuterly striking brachyanti-
ciinel fold. its roof. coapoeed of Vaianginian beds. is 35 kilometers
long and 20 vide.

‘The productive horizons at this deposit vore found in Lover Cretaceous
and Jurassic beds.

Plovs of gas have been received from Albion beds in the Lover Creta-
cezus sediments. The yield of the veils is about 100.000 cubic esters
s sy.

Insignificant petroleua flows have been received lover in the cross-
eection. froa the roof of the Aptien beds.

The primary gee condensate pool at the deposit is confined to Valen-
ginien beds (Lover Cretaceous); it is as such as 150 meters thick in
the southern part of the uplift end 15-20 meters on the limbs in the
northern part. Three productive horizons are singled out vithin the
Velsngien stratum.

The upper productive horizon has an alternation of eendstones. eleuro-
lites. and clays. The horizon is up to 25 meters thick. It is an
arched. layered pool. The gas contains condensate.

The second Velanginian horizon is composed of sandstonoa. The cap is
a clay packet 10-70 meters thick. This is an arched. layered gas con-
densate pool vith s small petroleum fringe. The voter-gas contact is
at 1,920 meters.

The third productive horicon lies at the base of the Vslanginien beds.
This horizon is coaposed of a packet of alternating sandstones. eleuro-
lites. end srgillites. A clay layer 10-25 meters thick serves as the
cap.

The gas condensate pool has a smell petroleum iringo. The layer pres-
sure of the gas is 185-190 kilogram-force per square centimeter.

In the middle Jurassic beds the gas condensate pool is confined to the
lover part of the cross-section. vhich is composed of fine-grained
sandstones and aleurolite interleyers.

An insignificant amount of petroleum is extracted vlth the gas from
some veils.

The gases of the primary velanginien pool of the Novoportovskoye

deposit end the gas pool identified in Jurassic beds contain. in addition
to methane. significant amounts of ethane (up to 6.5 percent) and propane
(about tvo percent) as vell es more high aoleculer hydrocarbons. vhich
are a valuable component for obtaining market products. The coaposition
of the gases is virtually the same in the different pools end can be
described by the averaged values given for all pools in Table 31 (next

use) .

The Hessoyskhskoye Deposit

The Hessoyekhskoye deposit is located in Kresnoyerskiy Kray, 130 kilo-
eeteis west of the city of Noril'sk. lt wee discovered in 1967 end
brought into operation in 1969.

The deposit is confined to o large brechysnticlinal fold that is 35

kilometers long end 20 wide at the roof of its productive Canomenien
'tfﬂ “Is

One pretence is associated with terrigenous beds of the Cenonenien
Steps. which is composed of anndstones end sleurolites interbedded
with eleys. The pool is cep ed by e loo-meter stratum of tiny of the
Turonian Stage. The product we stretue is 30-60 neters thick.

The productive layers lie et depths of 750-090 esters. The initial
leyer pressure is 76.0-77.6 kilogram-force per square centimeter
(hydrostatic). end the temperature is 11-12 degrees c. In eddition to
the Cenomanien. exploretory drilling hes revealed the presence of gas
in the Jurassic beds of the hassoyakhskoye deposit.

The hydrocarbon conposition of the Cenonanian see is like the coepo-
sition of the Cenonanien gas at other trees of the Northern Group of
Deposits of the western Siberien Lowland. It is s nethene see with

a low level of heevy hydrocarbons (see Table 32, next pege).

The gas pools in the Jurassic beds have not been edequetely explored
end little study of their composition hes been done. however. ensly-
ses made of geses obteined froe well testing et depths of 1.936-2.096
meters show thet they differ from the gases of the Cenomenien pool by
hydrocerbon composition; they are methane asses. In this respect
the gases of the Juressic beds of the Messoyakhskoye deposit differ
fundamentally from the noses of the Jureesic beds at other sites of
the Northern Group of Deposits of the western Siberien Lowlsnd.

The everege conposition (in percentages) of seses from the Geno-enien

The industrially feasible gas presence at the deposit is associated with
the highly permeable sand-aleurolite layers of the lower part of the
Sukhdudinskaya Series of the Lower Cretaceous.

Five productive layers have been identified at the deposit.

Layer SD [for Sukhodudinskaya] is notable for the homogeneity of its
lithological conposition. The layer is 18-20 meters thick and has an
initial layer pressure of 225 kilogram-force per square centimeter.

Layer SD is separated from 803 by a packet of clay rocks 10-20 meters
thick. This layer is composed of sandstones vith interstratified clay
interlayers. The layer is 10-26 meters thick and has an intial layer
pressure of 231 kilogram-force per square centimeter.

Layer SDs was tested together with SD The layer has not been shovn to
be independently important. Its thicﬁness is 5-35 meters.

Layer 506 has the largest gas condensate pool in the cross-section of the
Palyatkinskoye deposit. It is 62.6-72.6 meters thick. The layer is com-
posed of alternating sand and clay sheets. The initial layer pressure

in the pool is 233.8 kilogram-force per square centimeter.
The lowest pool is associated with the trsps of layer SD . which is
separated {roe layer an by s clsy pscket 30-45 neters t ick. The total
thickness of the layer is 28-36 esters. and it has e layer pressure of

characterized by four average (type) compositions, shown in Table 61
below.

The first type characterizes the gases of the Cenomanian Stage of the
Upper Cretaceous. which are widespread in the northern part of the
western Siberian platform. in Jurassic beds this type composition is
cos-on at deposits of the northwestern group.

The second type is characteristic for genes from the Valsnginian
Stage of the Lower Cretaceous at the Urengoyskoye. Tasovskoye. and
Kossomol'shoye deposits.

The third type includes gases free the productive layers of the Upper
Jurassic beds of the Urengoyskoye, Tasovukoye. and Novoportovskeye
deposits and gases free the Valanginian Stage at the Novoportovskoye
and Hedvesh'ys deposits.

The fourth type is characteristic of gases from petroelum-gas pools of
the lower productive layers of the Jurassic beds at the Medvesh‘ye.
Urengoyshoye. and other deposits.

The composition of natural gases changes with the depth of occurence

of the productive layers at deposits. For example, the lowest level

of homologues of methane at the Urengoyskoye deposit is observed in the
upper packets of the Cenomanisn pool and its uprsised domed parts. The
bottom part contains slightly sore heavy hydrocarbons than the top
layers.

In the Valanginian pool. which is lower, the concentration of heavy
hydrocarbons increases to 3.5 percent, and in the Jurassic beds it goes
Eros eight percent in the top horizons to 13 percent in the lower ones.

In layers where the presence of petroleum coaplicates the picture, the
total proportion of heavy hydrocarbons reaches 28 percent.

Similar growth in the concentration of heavy hydrocarbons with depth

or productive layers is observed in gases free other mmltilsyered depos-
its of the Western Siberian Lowland. For example. the average level of
homologues of aethsne in gases from the Cenoasnian pool is 0.15 percent.
In the beds of the Valanginisn Stage their concentration in the gases
reaches 11 percent. and in Jurassic beds it is 28-30 percent.

Tables 42 and 63 below give the average market characteristics of the
gases of the productive layers of deposits in the Northern Region.

2. The Berezovo Group of Deposits

This group is located east of the Ural Range within the North Sos'vs
arch. The arch has a northeeatarly trend. a length of 500-600 kilo-
meters. and a width ranging fron 20 to 250 meters.

The following gas and gas condensate deposits have been discovered in
this region: berezovakoye. Severo-Alyasovskoye and Yuzhno-Alyasovskoye,
Deminskoye. Severe-Kasymskoye. Pokhrosskoye, Chuel'skoye. Nishnetugiyanskoye,

The 8ovoro-Alyasovskoya and Yurhno-Alyasovakoye Deposits

Tho Alyesovskiye deposits are located near the settlement of nererovo.
The southern (Yuehno-) is 23 kilo-stars from town and the northern
(Savoro-) is 28. The deposits were discovered in 1956. They are set in
the northern and northeastern parts of the Berssovo uplift zone and are
composed of disconnected enticlinel folds with e northeasterly strike.

The southern uplift is 6.: kilometers long and three kilometers wide;
the northern fold is six kilometers long and two wide.

Industrielly feasible see is present at the deposits in layer P. con-
fined to Upper Jurassic beds, and layer N. set in Gotoriv-Berremian
beds (Lower Cretaceous).

Productive layer P is compoaed of sandstones, aleurolites. and lime-
atonas; their thickness ranges from zero to 60 meters in the southern
uplift and 0-27 meters in the northern structure. The thickness of the
layer increases on the limbs of the structures. ‘

At the Yuthno-Alyasovohoyc deposit productive layer P lies at a depth of
l,195-1.3b9 meters; at the Severo-Alyaeovskoye deposit its depth is
l.265-l.3h5 meters.

The layer pressure at both deposits is 126-126 kilogram-force per square
centimeter.

At the Yuzhno-Alyasovskoye deposit the second productive horizon N has

been opened up at a depth of 1.096-1,166 meters. The layer is composed
of aleurolites with interleyers of dense limestones in the lower part.
Layer N has a total thickness of 27-33 meters. '

The pool is a layered type with layer pressure of 112 kilogram-force
per square centimeter. The water-gas contact occurs at 1,088 meters.

At the Severo-Alyasovskoye uplift layer N lies at a depth of 1,090-
l.120 meters and is composed of aleurolites interstratified with lime-
stones and argillites. Two productive pockets are singled out in this
layer; they are separated by a 10-meter pocket of ergillites. The
average layer pressure is 112-117 kilogram-force per square centimeter.
The water-sea contact occurs at 1.103 meters.

The gas pools in layer N are smaller than those of layer P.

thickness Eros tuo asters at the arch to 37 asters on the limbs. The
layer occurs at depths of l,l95-l.368 meters. The productive horizon
is capped by a stratum of i-perneable argillites 68-80 asters thick at
the arch and 167 asters on the lisbs. The water-see contact occurs at
an absolute depth of 1,275 meters. Layer pressure is 126 kilogram-force
per square centiseter.

The second productive layer N. which lies higher on the cross-section.
l,068-l.l32 asters. is coaposed of ssndy-aleurolite rocks and has a total
thickness of 29-3‘ asters. The water-gas contact lies at an absolute

The Pokhromskoye deposit is located 38 kilometers northeast of the
settlement of Darazovo. The deposit was discovered in 1960. The
Pohhromskoye uplift is a brachyanticlinal latitudinal—trending fold.

Productive layer P has been identified in beds of Upper Jurassic age at
a depth of 1.313-l.437 meters. It is composed of limestones and sand-
stones with thick aleurolite and clay interlayers. The thickness of the
layer ranges from four meters at the arch to 50 meters on the limbs.

The pool is 11.5 kilometers long and 4.5 wide with a gee-bearing layer
of 126 meters. Initial layer pressure is 162 kilogram-force per square
centimeter and the temperature is 68.8 degrees c.

The water-gas contact occurs at 1,626 meters. Gas from layer P of the
Pokhromskoye deposit varies little at different wells. Its composition
in given in Table 68 (next page).

The condensate content in gas from the Pokhromskoye deposit does not
exceed 10-15 cubic centimeters per cubic meter of gas. The uniformity

of composition of gas in the pool makes it possible to use the following

The Luginetshoys Deposit

The Luginetshoye gas condensate deposit is located in the southwestern
part of Toeskaya Oblast, 100 kilometers northwest of the settlement of
Pudino. The deposit is confined to a northeasterly-striking enticlinal
fold.

Industrially feasible gas condensate pools have been indentified in
beds of the Upper Jurassic. layer Yu-l-Ill. This layer encompasses the

sendy-aleurolits rocks of the Vasyugan Series (Tu-l) and the Tyumen‘
Series (Yu-ll-TII).

The roof of layer Yu-l-Ill was opened up at the depth interval 2.260-
2.352 esters. Layer pressure is 260-246 kilogram-force per square

centimeter. The pool has a high gas condensate factor (more than 160
cubic centimeters per cubic meter).

Petroleum has been found in the lower part of the layer. The cosposi-
tion of gas from the Luginetskoye deposit shows a relative small amount
of ethane (about 3.5 percent). a relatively high amount of propane (up
to three percent). about 1.5 percent butanes. up to one percent pentanes
and higher molecular hydrocarbons.

The gases contain a relatively small amount of 002 (o 5 percent) and
nitrogen (about 2 5 percent).

The composition of gases from the Luginetskoye deposit changes little
within the Pool; a slightly higher content of heavy hydrocarbons has
been found in the petroleum zones. The gases of this deposit may be
described by the following average figures. in percentages:

cu“ '"' 8509 C‘ulo ’- 1e7 N2 -" 2.5
‘32,“. - (0.0 C5312 -- 1.0 002 -- 0e8

The gas has a density of 0.700 relative to air and its lowest heat of
burning is 8. 600 gigacalories per cubic meter.

The Hyl'dzhinskoye Deposit

This is a gas condensate deposit located 40 kilometers south of the town
of Sredniy Vasyugan.

The Hyl‘dzhinskoye deposit is confined to the uplift of the same name.
It is a northeasterly-atriking enticlinal fold.

Industrially feasible gas is found in beds of the Cretaceous and Upper
Jurassic. The layers are identified in Cretaceous sediments: B-VIII
and s-x in the Kulomeinskaya Series of the Valanginian and B-XVI to XX
in the Achilovskaya Subscries of the Lower Velanginian

composed of fine and medium grained sandstones. This is a gas conden-

sate pool with layer pressure of 256 kilogram-force per square centimeter
and a temperature of 80 degrees c.

The gases of the Cretaceous and Jurassic beds of the Hyl'dshinskoye
deposit differ little in composition. A characteristic feature of them
is that the concentration of propane is slightly higher than that of
ethane. This is true of gases from most of the deposits of Tomskaye
Oblest. which distinguishes them from gases from gas condensate pools
in most regions of the country. A description of the horizons of the
Hyl'dzhinekoye deposit is given in Table 53 (next page).

The Severe-Vaeyuganskoye Deposit

This gas condensate deposit is located 520 kilometers northwest of the
city of Novosibirsk.

The deposit occurs in a dome-like uplift. Beds of the Upper Jurassic
(layer Yu-I) and the Middle Jurassic (layer Yu-II) contain industrially
feasible gas at this deposit.

Layer Yu-I lies at a depth of 2.270-2,JSO meters and is composed of
sandstones, eleurolites, and argillites. It is a gas condensate pool
with a high (up to 260 cubic centimeters per cubic meter) concentration
of condensate. The initial layer pressure in the pool is 2‘4 kilograeu
force per square centimeter.

Layer Yu-II is composed of alternating sandstones. aleurolites. and
argillites. It is a gas condensate pool also.

Pools Yu—I and Yu-II are being exploited together. Cases from the gas
condensate pool of the Severe-Vasyuganskoye deposit‘ have a high level
of methane homologues and are very valuable for receiving liquified

propane-butane gases for the extraction of ethane and gaseous bemzines

[Text] The Deposits of Central Asia

A large nuaber of gas, gas condensate, and pstroleun-gas deposits have
been discovered in Central Asia in the Turknan, Uzbek, and Tsdshik
republics and in Western Kazakhstan.

Many of the. are located in the Central Asian and Karakuny platforss.

lndustrially feasible gas presence in Central Asia has been established
for the strategic [sic] cosplex from Persian-Triassic to Neogenic beds.

The Iain gas deposits are associated with Mesozoic beds of the Central
Asian platters. Gas pools have been discovered in Neogenic, Cretaceous.
and Jurassic iorsations.

The Deposits of Turk-enistan

The deposits are grouped into the northeastern and central. gas regions
according to territorial, in particular geological, structure and the
nature of gas and petroleua presence.

The groups of petroleus and gas deposits discovered in the Nest Turk-en
interaontane trough are singled out as the western' region of Turk-eni-
stan (see figure 6, next page).

The large Achakskoye, Gugurtlinskoye. and Naip deposits have been dis-
covered and are being worked in this region of Turkmenistan.

Industrislly feasible gas in the northern region of Turkmenistan occurs
in Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic beds. The cross-section of these beds
contains a large number of gas and gas condensate pools.

The gas-bearing horizons are composed primarily of terrigenous traps.
Only the Upper Jurassic horizons are made up of limestones.

The Achakskoye Deposit

The Achskskoye gas condensate deposit is located 60 kilometers southeast
of the city of Urgench ‘

Middle and Upper Jurassic, Cretaceous. Paleogenic. and Neogenic beds
participate in the geological structure of the deposit. The structure
is a large anticline trending from southwest to northeast. The fold is
25 kilometers long and eight vide. The northwest limb of the structure
is made complex by tectonic dislocations. The Achekskoye deposit has
several layers. Industrially feasible pools of gas have been identified
in beds of the Lower Cretaceous and Upper and Middle Jurassic. The
Cretaceous and Jurassic beds are composed of sandstones with clay-
sleurolite interlayera .

The gas-bearing horizons lie in the depth interval l.b50-2.200 meters.
The total thickness of the individual horizons ranges from 15 to 75 meters.

The initial layer pressure varied with depth from 166 to 231 kilogram-
Eorce per square centimeter and tbapereture runs from 70 to 92 degrees C.

Gas fro- the productive layers of the Achakskoye deposit can be clas-
sified as hydrocarbon-nethene gas with low levels of CO and nitrogen
(see Table 61. next page). The content or these compongnts increases
with the depth of the productive layers.

Horizons 1x and x of the Upper Jurassic contain the most nitrogen (up
to 3-6 percent) end 002 (to 0.6 percent).

The content of eethane homologuea also increases with depth. There is
no hydrogen sulfide in the gases. -

The content of stable condensate in gases fro- the Achakskoye deposit
renges from lb to 30 cubic centimeters per cubic meter.

Two average compositions can be used to describe the natural gases of
this deposit:

1. one for the gases of horizons II, III, IV. and V of
the Lower Cretaceous beds;

2. one for horizons IX and X of the Jurassic beds.

The average compositions of gases from the Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic
bed are shown in Table 62 below.

The gas condensate pool with the largest volume is confined to horizons
XV-XVI at depths of 1.910-2.256 eaters. It is composed priaarily of
limestones.

The gases of the productive layers of the Cretaceous beds are uniform
in hydrocarbon composition, contain small amounts of 602 and nitrogen.
and have no hydrogen sulfide.

The coeposition of gases in the Jurassic beds differs from the gases of
the Cretaceous beds by having slightly more c0 (up to 1.5 percent).
containing hydrogen sulfide (to 0.2 percent), 3nd heterogeneity with
respect to methane hoeologues. whose concentration increases with depth.
The greatest amount, up to 12-12.S percent, is round in gases from

The gases of horizons VII and VIII contain more nitrogen also, up to
five percent. The condensate content increases with depth too; the
largest amount (up to 20 cubic centimeters per cubic meter) has been
found in gases from Lower Cretaceous horizon XVIII (see Table 64. next

page).
The Naip Deposit

This deposit is located 50 kilometers southeast of the Achakskoye
deposit. It occurs in an uplift which has the appearance of a north-
northeasterly-trending anticlinel fold.

Gas presence at this deposit has been established in beds of the Upper
Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous. Thirteen productive layers have been
singled out. horizons 11a, 11b, and III are confined to Aptian sand-
stones; horizons IVv, V, and Va to the Neocomian, and VI. VII, VIII. IX,
and X to the carbonate traps of the Upper Jurassic.

Industrielly feasible gas presence has been found in subsalt cer-
bonste beds of the Upper Jurassic The gas pool of horizon xv is an
arched, massive type confined to fractured Callovian-Oxfordian limo-
stones. The full thickness of the productive limestone mass is 395
esters. The productive horizon occurs at a depth of 2,300-2.500
esters. Layer pressure is 276 kilogram-force per square centimeter.
end the teaperature is 98 degrees c, Signs of petroleue are present

in horizon XV in both the gas and water-saturated parts of the pool.

The gas from the Seeantepe deposit is a methane gas. The concentration
of the other hydrocarbon coeponents in the gas drops sharply as their

molecular mass increases. Thus, propane does not exceed 0.5 percent,
butane 0.2 percent, and pentsne 0.1 percent.

A characteristic feature of gases from the Samantepe deposit is high
levels of hydrogen sulfide (3.2 p rcent)* and carbon dioxide (to six
percent). The concentration of nitrogen does not exceed one percent
and the most condensate is about 10 cubic centimeters per cubic meter.

The composition of gases from the Upper Jurassic beds (horizon XV) is
uniform through the entire thickness of the productive layer. The con-
centrations of components of the mixture change little within the

bounds of the pool. and they may be described by the following average
figures (see also Table 67, next page):

W‘ .- 88e3 “£40.10 ‘- 0.07 "2 -- 0.5
Czﬂa -- 2.3 1-05812 -- 0.05 C02 -- 5.0
can8 -- 0.38 n-csn12 -- 0.04 nzs -- 3.2
i-C‘ll10 -- 0.08 c6ﬂla + higher -- 0.1

The gas has a density of 0.669 relative to air. Its lowest heat of
burning is 7,760 gigacalories per cubic meter and the highest is 8.580.

These gases are classified as high—calorie typical hydrocarbon gases
according to their market features. The gas can only be used in gas
supply when the hydrogen sulfide is removed (for use as a source of
marketable sulfur) and it is dried in order that the gas can be trans-
ported reliably without using a 002 ballast mixture.

The Ielin Deposit

The Ielim deposit is located 5-7 kilometers from the pity of Kushka,

within an anticlinal northeasterly-trending fold. The southwest part
of the fold is in Afghanistan.

Cretaceous and Jurassic beds contain gas at the deposit. Gas has been
received from beds of the Cenomanian, Turonian, Neocomian-Aptien and
Jurassic.

The Cenomanian beds are composed of interstratified thick sheets of
calcareous clays and gray limestones. The gas received from these beds

has a high level of homologuea of methane (up to 20 percent). nitrogen
(to five percent), and 002 (to 2.5 percent). It contains no hydrogen
sulfide.

The Turonian beds, composed of dense linestones, have produced a gas
that is similar in composition to the gas of the massive, arched Ceno-
manian pool. The layer pressure is 268 kilogram-force per square cen-
timeter end the temperature is 100 degrees 0.

An arched, layered pool with layer pressure of 260 kilogram-force per
square centimeter and a temperature of 113 degrees C. has been identi-
fied in the beds of the Neocomisn-Aptian, which is represented by an
alternation of thick limestones, clays, and sandstones. The composi-
tion of gases from this pool is similar to that of the gases found in
the Cenomanian and Turonian beds. In the Jurassic beds, which are com-
posed of fine-grained sandstones, is an arched. 1.y.r.d p001 with layer
pressure of 271.2 kilogram-force per square centimeter, exceeding hydro-
static pressure. The layer temperature in the pool is 117 degrees c.
In addition to the gas it produces a significant amount of condensate
with a density of 0.783 which contains about 30 percent aromatic hydro-
carbons and up to two percent parsffins.

The gas has no hydrogen sulfide. In general, the gases of the lslim
deposit have a high level of methane homologues and are closer in com-
position to the gases of petroleum-gas deposits.

Table 68 (next page) shows the composition of gas from the deposit.
The Karachop Deposit

This deposit is located 35 kilometers east of the city of Kushka, con-

fined to a northeasterly-trending brachyanticlinal fold that is 13
kilometers long and six wide.

Industrially feasible gas is found at the deposit in carbonate beds of
the Upper Cretaceous. Gas has been received from the Danian and Haas-
trichtian stages. The gas-bearing horizon of Danian sandstones lies

at 640-720 meters. It is an arched, layered pool with layer pressure
of 59 kilogram-force per square centimeter and a temperature of 50
degrees C. Table 69 below shows the composition of gas from the Creta-
ceous Cenomanian beds of the Karachop deposit.

The Bayremli Deposit

The Bayramli gas deposit is one of the largeonas in Turkmenistan. It
is located to kilometers north of the city of Mary.

The geological structure of the deposit includes Jurassic. Cretaceous,
Paleogenic, Neogenic. and Quaternary beds. This deposit was the first
place in the Murbatskaya depression where the entire thickness of salt
beds of the Upper Jurassic was penetrated and the subsalt Oxfordian
limestones. which are promising for gas exploration in this region,
were opened up.

Beds of the Karabil'skaya Series of the Lower Cretaceous contain indus-
trially feasible gas at the deposit.

The gas pool is confined to the upper sandy mass of the series. The
pool lies at 2.780—2,825 meters. It has a layer pressure of 302
kilogram-force per square centimeter and a temperature of 105 degrees C.
The pool in the Karabil'skaya Series is an arched. floating pool.

This pool contains a methane gas (up to 98 percent) with only small
amounts of methane homologues (up to 1.5 percent).

The gases from the Bayramli deposit do not contain the heavy hydrocar-
bons Cs and higher or hydrogen sulfide. They have a small amount of
nitrogen and C02.

The absence of gas condensate fractions and aggressive impurities
makes the gas field technology much simpler.

The Hayskoye Deposit

This gas deposit is located 30 kilometers southeast of the city of Mary,

within a narrow brachyanticline set directly south of the Bayramli
deposit.

The structure is 15 kilometers long and 4.5 wide. Two domes, the
northern and southern, have been identified in the structure.

The productive horizon of the Karabil'skaya Series of Neocomian-Aptisn
beds is composed of sandstones with clay interlayers and lies at a depth
of 3.000-3;150 meters. The porosity of the traps is about 19 percent
and permeability is 105 mn.

The initial layer pressure in the pool is 324 kilogram-force per square
centimeter and the temperature is 124 degrees c. The pool is an arched
floating type.

The composition of the Gases from the deposit is similar to the compo-
sition of gas from the Karabil'sksya Series of the nearby Bayramli
deposit. They have a high concentration of methane, a small amount of

The Sharapli Deposit

The Sharapli gas deposit is located 80 kilometers north of the city of
Mary. Stratigraphically, the deposit is coeposed of Mesozoic-Cenozoic
beds which have been opened up to a thickness of 3,800 neters.

The cross-section that has been revealed is identical to the cross-
section at the Bayrauli deposit.

The deposit is confined to a brachyanticlinal fold eight kilometers long
and two wide. The sandstones of the Karabil'skaya Series of the
Neoconisn-Aptian, 120 heters thick. contain industrially feasible gas.
The gas pool has been opened at a depth of 2,288-2,307 meters. Layer

pressure is 251 kilogram-force per square centimeter and the tempera-
'ture is 85 degrees C.

The Keli Deposit

The Keli gas deposit is located 90 kilometers northwest of the city of
Mary. It is confined to a narrow brachyanticlinal fold. Industrially
feasible gas presence has been established in the Karabil'skaya Series
of Neocomian-Aptian beds at a depth of 2,468-2.b72 meters. The layer,
pressure is 266 kilogram-force per square centimeter. The pool is an

arched. floating type.

The gases from all the dposits of the central part of the Hurgabskaya
depression. located in the vicinity of the city of Mary, (Lower Creta-

ceous gas complex) are methane gases with respect to composition. The
nethane concentration in them is 95-96 percent.

[Articles ”The 0168!! Coal Industry in the First Half of 1978"]

[Text] The Ukraine's miners extracted 106.“. million tons of coal during
the first half of this year (table 1). The plan for coal mined for coking
was met by 100.3 percent. The plan for labor productivity per worker for
mining coal was met by 102.2 percent.

As of 1 July 1978 the republic's coal industry had 1.590 active breakage
faces: the average active line of the breakage faces was 21.1..56 Ian. and
the average monthly advance was 37.7 meters. The average daily extraction
of coal per active breakage face was 381. tons. The daily production of
one underground or strip mine (adninietrative unit) averaged 2.63? tons.

At underground mines. breakage faces that were mechanized in integrated
fashion and equipped with cuttexsloaders and single-bucket overhead exca-
vators numbered 1.62 where seams were at gradient angles of less than 35
degrees. From these faces h9.111.000 tons of coal were mined under a plan
for 1.8.990.000 tons. which was 57.1. percent of all that mined from oper-
ating breakage faces at seams with gradient angles of less than 35 degrees.

At seams with gradient angles of more than 35 degrees. there were 51 break-
age faces mechanized in integrated fashion. including 1.8 that were
equipped with AShch roof supports. Mined at steep seams were 1.512.000
tons under a plan for 1.510.000 tons. and the average daily workload per
face was 205 tons.

For URSSR Himgleprom [Ministry of Coal Industry] as a whole. the plan for
the conduct of all preparatory excavation was met by 100.1 percent. and
the plan for stripping and preparatory excavation by 98.9 percent

(table 2). Ehzcavation conducted with the mechanized loading of coal and
rock was 981.9 Ian. or 76.8 percent of the total length of excavation con-

ducted where loading was required.

Coal preparation workers of the republic's coal industry processed 66.53
million tons of coal and produced 1.0.31 million tons of clean coal at
