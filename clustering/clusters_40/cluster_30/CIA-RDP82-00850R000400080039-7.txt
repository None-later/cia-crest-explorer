tion and formation of theme! waters in-the territory of Georgia. On the basis of
precise temperature measurements in deep conditional boreholes. determination of
the thermophysical properties of rocks, and also generalization of industrial geo-
physical data it was possible to characterise the heat field in Georgia and the
eastern part of the Black Sea surface. Deep heat flows were computed and it was
possible to discriminate the most heated sectors of the earth's crust. A many-sided
investigation of hydrogeological and geothermal conditions makes it possible to
predict promising areas for obtaining highly thermal waters. considerable resources
of which are the basis for the effective use of the energy in the earth's deep lay-
ers in the economy of Georgia. The monograph is intended for mrkers at scientific.
planning and production organizations concerned with geological and geophysical
problems and the detection of new renewable energy sources.

Preface

The exploitation of the earth's deep heat for practical economic needs is one of
the cardinal energy problems of the present day. The Soviet government, taking
into account the great effectiveness of use of thermal waters and their role in
preserving the environment from contamination in every possible way is facilitat-
ing the development of scientific research and exploration-operational work, as

is reflected in the corresponding decrees of the USSR Council of Ministers and the
Council of Ministers Georgian SSR.

A scientific generalization of studies of ground water in Georgia has been made

by I. H. Buschidze in 1950 and in 1956 he was the first to define the thermal
horizons in Western Georgia. In 1961 I. H. Buschidze and 5. S. Chikhelidze com-
piled the first sumnary on the thermal waters of Georgia. Later intensive stud-
ies developed at both scientific research (Sector on Hydrogeology and Geological
Engineering, Georgian Academy of Sciences. and others) and in production enter-
prises (Georgian Geological Administration, "Gruzneft'" Trust. Georgian Production
Administration on Use of the Earth's Deep Heat. and others). The monograph "Gidro-
noolouiya 555R, t X, Gruzinsksys SSR (hydrogeology of the USSR. Vol X, Georgian
SSR) appeared in 19IO. This monograph presented summarized data on thermal vaters
and some geothermal elements. Thus, the thermal waters of Georgia are some of the
best studied in our country. This is indicated, in particular. by the circum-
stance that among the predicted resources of thermal waters in a volume greater
than 8000 liters/sec about 72 fall in the industrial categories approved by the
appropriate state committee.

A knowledge of the heat field patterns is of decisive importance for detecting

and exploring thermal waters. The scientific value of geothermal investigations
is expressed, in turn, in the fact that the principal parameter - the temperature

distribution in the earth's crust and upper mantle - is necessary for general
geological-geophysical constructions. for the needs of such disciplines as geo-
tectonics. geology of ore deposits, presence of petroleum and gas. etc. without
a knowledge of the forecasted temperatures it is impossible to carry out mining
work. to drill deep boreholes and exploit deposits. The intensive use of thermal
waters in the national economy requires detailed investigations of geothermal
conditions for the prediction of changes in their parameters. Finally. the de-
tection of heat field patterns will lake it possible to approach on a realistic

basis a solution of the problem of creating artificial circulation systems for
the removal of heat from "dry" rocks.

lAnnotution, introduction and table of contents from thebook.'BandbookforDrilling
nt Surface vines," edited by B. A. Simkin. professor and doctor of engineering sci—
ences, lzdatel'stvn "Nedra," 7,200 copies, 270 pages].

lTextl The book sets forth the physical and mechanical properties of rock and its
effect on the effectiveness of drilling blast holes at surface nines. The methods
of drilling and the design and technical characteristics of the drilling equip-
ment—-domestic and forcign--are described. The classification and area of applica-
Lion of drilling tools and methods for computing drilling parameters and regimes
are cited. Questions of automated control of the drilling process and of drill
quIpmcnt drives, the reliability of drilling equipment and tools. and methods and
means for dealing with dust during hole drilling are examined. The technical and
economic indicators and the standards for drilling work are cited. and recommenda-
Lions are made for the scientific organization of the work of drill-equipment
upcl‘ulul‘s.

The handbook is intended for engineers and technicians of mining enterprises and
scientific-research and design organizations. and it will also be useful to in-
structors and students of mining and construction vuzes.

Introduction

when excavating for useful minerals by the surface method, the drilling of blast
holes is n Lop-priority. complicated and labor-intensive process. During open-cast
exonVntinn for con]. iron ore, nonferrous metals and raw materials for chemicals.
the drilling of blast holes is extremely important. The annual amount of hole
drilling at open cuts comes close to 60 million meters.

Essential changes have occurred in the structure of drilling equipment at surface
mines in the past 10 years. Instead of cable-tool drilling machines. milling
drills are being used widely. the share of which in overall drilling is about 70
percent. In the past decade more than 3.000 drilling machines for surface mining
have been mnnufactured. About 50 percent of them are SBSh's-—milling type drills
(including the new usMSh-zuo. zSBSh-ZOON, SBSh-ZSOMN and SBSh-SZO drills and
others), while the remainder are SBR- and SVB-type rotary drills. At coal strip
mines milling-type drills make up about 40 percent of the whole drilling machinery
pool .

l.

The design and the quality of manufacture of milling-type bits has been improved.
The mining industry is now the largest customer for this type of rock-destroying
tools. Equipment for rotary cutting drilling, which predominates at coal strip
mines. has been improved. New type bits-DR-16OSh, DL-lGOSh, NPI-6/160 and
others--are being introduced.

Along with the rotary drilling of holes of small diameter (115 and 160 mm) with
auger removal of the drilling fines, the drilling of holes 214 and 243 mm

in diameter with pneumatic cleaning is being used increasingly widely, the DR-214V
and ORV-214 drill bits being used.

The bodies of the drill bits have begun to be manufactured by pressworking. Re-
placeable cutting tools are being used widely. Semiautomatic machines that use
high-frequency current have begun to be used to braze cutting tools.

Combined cutting-and-milling and cutting-and-percussion tools. hole reamers.
mine—race shock absorbers. and various (for example, electric vibrators) intensifi-
ers of the drilling pioccss have been tested. Submersible pneumatic strikers have
been improved. At some surface mines the drilling machines are tended by one oper-
ator. Cost indicators have been improved. and the productivity of the machines as
well as the durability of the drill bits have been increased.

Methods for computing optimal drilling regimes are of special significance. since
the crunnmic and technical indicators of milling and other methods for drilling
holes depend greatly upon the drilling regimes. Choice of optimal drilling re-
gimes and their correlation with the technical paramaters of automated drills is
acquiring great importance. Milling drills with manual control operate in a ra-
tional regime of 8-50 percent net drilling time. since manual control is diffi-
cult, because of continuous random variation in the properties of the rock being
drilled. Even when the operator uses rational drilling programs. with manual regu-
lation. deviations of the regime's parameters from the optimal values are 15-25
percent and,in this case. considerably degrade the technical and economic indi-
cators for drilling.

Furnishing drills with automated control systems (SAU's) will enable optimal drill-
ing regimes to be realized. A test model of a machine for milling-type drilling.
the 3Snsh—200N. with automated control of the drilling regime. has been created.

The integrated mechanization of the excavation of deposits of useful minerals in-
volves the creation of new equipment for drilling work. the scale of which is in-
creasing in intensity.

Muny deposits are marked by complicated hydrogeological conditions in the deposi-
tion and structure of the covering rock masses. and the frequent alternation of
strong and weak rock. where serially produced, narrowly specialized drills do not
provide the required technical and economic indicators. especially when drilling
slanted holes 320-400 millimeters in diameter up to 60 meters deep. Under specific
mine-geology conditions of the deposits. combined drills are preferred.

The trend toward the construction of high-capacity mines. an increase in the number
or excavators with bucket capacities of 12-100 cubic meters. and the use of trans-
port mcans of high load capacity predetermine an increase in the working parameters
of drills. their power-to-weight ratios and productivity, and also the diameter

and depth ol'the holes. hernuse of this, it is especially ilportant that the par-
ameters or the equipment correspond to the operating conditions and to an optimal
drilling regime.

The circumstances noted will cause at the next stage of developaent of drilling
equipment and technology the creation of drills for drilling holes 125-400 millimet-
ers and more in diameter which are characterized by optimal relationships of
the design and the operating parameters.

The choice of parameters lbr drilling equipment and its adaptation to changing con-
ditions can be optimal only on the basis of the method of engineering optimization
and the use or current experimental research and the generalization of years of
experience. Taking into account what has been set forth in the handbook. systema-
tized data are cited about the bases for the creation and operation of drilling
equipment and tools at surface mines.

(Annotation, preface and table of contents from monograph "Seismic-Resistant Con-
struction in Permafrost". by Vadim Andrevevich Kharitonov, Stroyizdat, Leningrad-
skuye otdeleniye, 2580 copies, 180 pages]

[Text] Annotation. The author describes the characteristics of construction under
conditions of a combination of permafrost and seismicity in different regions of
the northern climatic zone. It is noted that the manifestation of seismic pheno-
menu in frozen. thawed and thawing ground governs the specifics of planning of
buildings and structures capable of reliable performance and capable of withstand-
ing the effect of earthquakes which are 7~9 units on the seism.-.c scale. Materials
are presented which describe the performance of foundations and the principal sup-
porting elements of buildings and structures under different seismogeological con-
ditions and recommendations are given on economic-optimization tasks and the organ-
izntion of seismic-resistant construction work in regions where permafrost pre-
vnils. The monograph is intended for planners and engineering-technical workers
concerned with problems relating to the construction and performance of buildings
and structures in seismic regions of the northern zone of the country.

Preface. About 302 of the entire territory of the Soviet Union is occupied by
seismic regions (Fig. 1). Host of these are situated in zones with a severe cli-
mate [1, 2]. The breakdown of the area of the entire country by seismic zones
(Table l) in accordance with official data shows that Siberia and the Far East
(numbers 6-11), constituting more than 601 of the entire territory of the Soviet
Union. are regions with extremely strong earthquakes.

In addition. it must be taken into account that the lO-unit Oymyakonskoye earth-
quake, occurring in 1971 [3]. indicated that our concepts concerning the seis-
mlclty of the northern zone of the country are still incomplete and a number of
regions. earlier considered aseismic. in actually should be assigned to the cate-
gory of seismically active with a high earthquake intensity.

For a long time no serious attention was given to the problems involved in seismic-
tesistant construction in the northern construction-climatic zone. In part this is
attributable to the historically weak population of the territory and the absence
here of considerable volumes 0‘ major construction. In addition, traditionally

in these regions the construction material in canon use has been wood, making it
possible. without special strengthening measures, to build one- or two-story res-
ident ial and industrial buildings which have been adequately seismic-resistant.

in the Baykal seismic zone at construction sites with deep and prolonged (up to
nine months per year) seasonal freezing of the ground and with permafrost [8].

A major series of investigations, including those made under field conditions, in-
dicated that for industrial year-round construction of seismic-resistant buildings
it is necessary to carry out a complex of special measures which can guarantee

the reliability of the erected structures. Among the most vulnerable places and
specific problems. for the considered zone it is necessary to mention the followb
ing:

-- the thorough freezing of excavated basins and trenches, and as a result, the
heaving of the ground and its subsequent nonuniform settling during thawing;

-- the thorough freezing of masonry and nonuniform deformation during its thawing,
which usually begins on the southern side and ends on the northern shaded side;

-- absence of reliable adhesion of masonry to metal components and individual re-
inforcing rods strengthening the masonry;

-- the brittleness of metal construction parts and connecting elements of ordinary
steel in prefabricated reinforced concrete construction;

-- the short lifetime of ordinary construction materials and fabricated objects
caused by periodic freezings and thawings of pore moisture in the material itself
and especially in juncture points.

A considerable contribution to solution of these problems has been made by the

The northern construction-climatic zone, including the regions of the Far North
and Northeast of the country. differs sharply from the middle zone with respect
to a number of factors which exert a substantial influence on the choice of meth-

ods for construction and constructive solutions for buildings and structures [8,
9].

The climatic characteristics caused by the severity of climate vary in a broad
range in different regions of the northern zone. In the coastal regions, where the
influence of North Atlantic currents is operative. the climate is milder, whereas
in the central parts of the continent it has a sharply continental character.

The characteristics and diversity of the natural-climatic conditions in the zone
of permafrost occurrence made it necessary to subdivide it into three subzones
[IO]. for which there is formulation of special requirements on buildings and
structures, for which appropriate construction norms are prepared. etc.

Subzone I. Permafrost over the greater part of its territory. In individual regions
seismicity not greater than 7 units. In mountain regions there are sectors with a
danger of avalanches and mudflows. Some of the territory is subject to creep
processes and karat phenomena are noted. The winter is prolonged with a polar

night. low air temperatures and strong. prolonged winds. creating snowdrifts. The
summer is short. cold and moist.

Subzone II. Permafrost over the entire territory. In individual regions seismic-
ity up to 8 units. There are sectors in which karst occurs, where mudflows take
place and wh'ch are subject to creep processes with a danger of avalanches. The
winter is severe and prolonged with extremely low air temperatures. Considerable
solar radiation and short warm summer.

Subzone III. Insular permafrost. Seismicity of individual regions up to 10 units.
There are sectors with a danger of avalanches. where karat and mudflows are mani-
fested and which are subject to creep processes. Prolonged cold winter and warm
sMrtsmumn

In accordance with the zoning for each zone provision is made for corresponding
planning solutions for populated places and industrial complexes; technological
schemes for the layout of buildings and structures are prepared. corresponding for
each zone to the load and effect. For each zone specialists have developed and are
developing special rational procedures for production processes ensuring the re-
liable performance of the erected structure under the conditions prevailing in

the northern climate zone.

A special place in the engineering problems of construction in the northern cli-
mate zone is occupied by microseismic regionalization. taking into account the
geourvnlnny of the construction site and the peculiarities in development of per-
mafrost processes in the construction and operation of erected structures, as
well as the influence of completed and prolonged permafrost processes on the
seismic resistance of construction objects {9].

Experience has shown that underallowance for a number of physicomechanical char-
acteristics of the frozen ground of foundations which are in a stage of gradual
thawing can create serious additional deformations and damage to the supporting
elements of buildings and structures even prior to an earthquake. In order to vali-
date the choice of construction principle. in addition to ordinary engineering
characteristics, it is necessary to have data on prediction of the possibility of

a change in permafrost conditions determined on the basis of thermophysical comput-
ations with allowance for the properties of different types of ground and their
permafrost characteristics.

[Text] Annotation. The book analyzes the design features of buildings and other
structures in the northern regions of Western Siberia. The indices of the climatic
and permafrost conditions of the region necessary for this purpose are systematized.
Measures for increasing the supporting capacity of earthen foundations are examined.
A method for thermal computations made in the planning of structures of different
purpose and configuration is presented. The book is intended for design engineers,
engineering field workers and construction sen engaged in the economic exploitation
of the northern part of Western Siberia and regions adjacent to it.

Preface. The northern part of Western Siberia is one of the richest regions in the
world with respect to natural resources. The economic exploitation of this terri-
tory. especially the construction of industrial and residential structures. is made
difficult by the specific permafrost-ground conditions: the great water saturation
and peatiness of the territory. the presence of permafrost, having primarily an in-
sular distribution and present in a plastic-frozen state.

Under such conditions it is particularly important to make engineering surveys of
construction areas and to develop measures for implementation of this construction.
taking into account the specifics of permafrost conditions and the objective trends
in their change as a result of the building-up of an area.

As is well known. due to considerable compressibility and prolonged consolidation
under a load peaty ground can be put into the “weak" category. Sites made up of
peaty ground are used for construction only in individual cases, for the most part
after consolidation or replacement of peat by stronger mineral ground or after the
implementation of other measures precluding the direct use of pests of natural bedd-
ing as foundations for structures. This circumstance, evidently. can explain the
fact of a considerable lag in study of the construction properties (deformative,
strength, thermophysical) of peaty ground, especially frozen ground.

Measures precluding the direct use of peaty ground as foundations are extremely ex-

pensive. For example, in the Surgut region the replacement of l m3 of peat by sand
costs about 6 rubles. Accordingly. failure to use peaty ground as foundations in

the northern part of Western Siberia. where in individual zones peat bogs occupy
up to 802 of the area with a thickness up to 10 m. is virtually impossible. I: is
necessary to formulate detailed investigations of the construction properties of
peaty ground in thawed and frozen states for the purpose of determining the pos-
sibilities of using them as foundations for buildings and structures.

A determination of most of the mentioned construction properties by field and lab-
oratory methods is time consuming and involves great time expenditures. Therefore.
it is of practical importance to develop indirect methods making it possible to
establish the quantitative characteristics of these properties using correlations
with the simplest physical properties (such as humidity and mass volume). easily as-
certained under laboratory conditions.

The presence of insular permafrost. on the one hand. and the requirements of Chap-
ter SNiP [Construction Specifications and Regulations] II-18-76. not allowing the
application of construction principles I and II within the confines of a single
construction site. on the other. determine still another feature of construction in
the northern part of western Siberia. making necessary additional material expend-

itures: the need for reducing the ground to a thermophysically homogeneous state
-- thawed or frozen.

Permafrost in the greater part of Western Siberia falls in the category of plastic-
frozen ground. having increased deformational properties. Thawed ground. usually
peaty or water saturated. is also characterized by a high compressibility and
therefore there is a need for preliminary strengthening. This is a third feature
also leading to increased costs of construction in the northern part of Hestern
Siberia.

The enumerated features in the designing and construction work in the northern re-
gions of western Siberia determine the following three timely directions in re-
search:

-- study and systematizing of data on the construction properties of frozen and
thawed peaty ground;

-- improvement in existing or development of new methods for computing the temper-
ature fields of freezing or thawing ground during the economic exploitation of
sites;

-- development of methods for increasing the supporting capacity of the ground.
used in both frozen and thawed states.

In this book we set forth the results of investigations in these directions carr-
ied out by the authors at the Krasnoyarsk ?romstroyniiproyekt and give practical
recommendations obtained on their basis. The results of other investigations for
regions with similar climatic and permafrost conditions are also used.

ters 3 and A. f7.l were written by A. A. Konovalov. 12.1, Chapters 5 and 6. l7.2.
