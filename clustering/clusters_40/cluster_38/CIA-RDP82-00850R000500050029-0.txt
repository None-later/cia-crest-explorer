[Text] The results are given of a study of the two-metal crevice corrosion of
steel specimens in a loop with the following parameters of the medium: pressure
of 0.6 MP8, temperature of 428 K, traveling speed of medium (condensate) of 0.5
m/s. Oxygen content-~04 to 0.4 met/kg. The size of the gap in assemblies was
not greater than 0.1 m. Studies were made of specimens of grade 20 steel in com-
bination with steel of grades 0|(h18N10T, AS—9 and EP-53 for 1500 h. It is demon.-
strated that the rate of corrosion of grade 20 steel reaches maximum values of
0.037 g/mzh in combination with grade as-9 steel and minimal values of 0.025
g/mzh in contact with grade 0Khl8NlO‘l‘ steel. Pits up to 70 microns deep were
present in grade 20 steel after testing, and there were no pits in the other ma-

[Text] A procedure is presented which is constructed on the basis of the experi-
mental data described in the paper. An analysis is made of the structure of the
flow and of the measured static pressure field, liquid phase velocity and acoustic
characteristics of the stream. The conclusion is drawn that a structural transi-
tion exists from a steam drop flow to a foam bubble one. A system of 18 differen—
tial equations of conservation with corresponding closing relations is suggested
for the laminar flow section. The systems of equations presented make it possible
to calculate flow parameters in the injector's mixing chamber from assigned initial
parameters and a known geometry.

[Annotation and abstracts from collection of articles "Research and Development
of Materials for Nuclear Fusion Reactors", edited by Academician N.V. Ageyev,
Izdatel'stvo "Nauka", 183 pages]

[Text] At the present time one of the most important tasks facing our country's
scientists and engineers is the creation of a new energy base based on the
utilization of thermonuclear power engineering.

The creation in the very near future of demonstration and industrial nuclear
fusion reactors with mgnetic and inertial plasma confinement has already now
become a reality. However, in order to solve these problems it is necessary to
create and study many classes of construction materials able to function under
the very severe conditions of thermonuclear reactors.

The present collection is made up of original articles on fundamental problems
of solid-state radiation physics as applied to problems of creating mterials
for nuclear fusion reactors. developing construction materials, etc. Individual
sections of the collection are devoted to studying the bulk and surface radiation
properties of various metallic and other materials; also included are original
articles on materials-science problems relating to pulsed thermonuclear reactors.

This edition is intended for a wide range of researchers and practical workers
working on scientific and engineering problems of controlled nuclear fusion.

vacuum-melted molybdenum and alloys TsﬂlOVD, TsM6 and Mo — 0.6 to 2.6 percent by
weight V - 0.03 percent by weight C when exposed to helium ions. Sputtering was
carried out in a low-pressure helium glow discharge and blistering was studied
under exposure to a monoenergetic ion beam with energy of 20 keV at a temperature

of 330 K with a,dose of 5-1017 ions/cmz. It is demonstrated that alloying
molybdenum with slight additions of vanadium, boron, aluminum and carbon does not
result in considerable changes in the erosion coefficients of alloys and in
blister-formation parameters as compared with pure molybdenum. Increasing the
content of vanadium in the Ho-V-C system results in some reduction of the alloy's

sputtering coefficient.

[Text] Data are given on radiation alteration of the physical properties (dimen-
sional stability, heat conduction, strength, creep, etc.) of construction graphite
for a wide temperature and neutron fluence range. The influence of several
technological factors in the production of graphite on radiation resistance is

discussed.

It is suggested that the data presented can be used for a preliminary estimate

of the working capacity of graphite under conditions of a fusion reactor. It is
furthermore noted that selection of the optimum working temperature in addition
to selection of the grade of graphite will make it possible to reduce radiation
disturbance of its properties and at the same time to extend the period for the

functioning of graphite in a fusion reactor.

I'UK UI‘I'IL'IAI. Ubl‘. ONLY

[Textl A review of the published data has established definite progress both

in determination of the probable working parameters of the first wall in fusion
reactors of various designs and in understanding of the features of radiation
effects which will take place in fusion reactors. The most complicated problems
invoIve volumetric radiation damage. They are similar to a great extent to those
discovered and studied in sufficient detail in materials used in fission reactors.

A whole series of experimental studies indicate the possibility of a more drastic
manifestation of some already known problems, such as, for example, high-tempera-
ture radiation embrittlement and swelling of nickel-containing steel and alloys
under conditions of the use of the first wall of a fusion reactor. These radia-
tion effects are intensified on account of the high concentrations of helium
formed in the majority of elements on account of nuclear reactions caused by
neutrons with energy of 14 HeV. The possibility is indicated of realistic tech-
nological and design solutions to a whole series of difficulties in the selection
and recommendation of materials for the first generation of fusion reactors.

The complexity of materials science problems associated with volumetric radiation
effects and the diversity of ways of solving them necessitate a comprehensive
approach for the purpose of finding the most economical and safe variants of
designs for the blanket of a fusion reactor.

STUDY OF PROCESSES 0P SUBLIHATION OF SOME CONSTRDCTION MATERIALS
[Abstract of article by Fedichkin, G.M., Bondarenko, 6.6. and Shmykov, A.A.]

[Text] By the method of microveighing under high vacuum, measurements are made
of the rates of sublimation of grade EP838 and 316 steel, the "Nimonik" alloy

(50 percent gamma phase) and a beta-titanium alloy over a wide temperature range.
Kinetic mechanisms are obtained for processes of the sublimation of volatile com-
ponents from the alloys studied. It is established that processes of the subli-
mation of volatile components of these alloys are limited by diffusion of these'
components toward the sublimation surface. Individual activation energies are
calculated. It is demonstrated that the manganese in EP-838 steel (2 - 45.7
heal/mole) is sublimated at the highest rate at working temperatures,aresu1ting
in the appearance of impermissible ferromagnetic regions on the surface of the
material. Based on the results obtained, an estimate is made of the contribution
of sublimation processes to the total erosion of construction materials.

Blements with an atomic number of less than 14 and their compounds are discussed
as shielding materials, and alloys based on vanadium. molybdenum and niobium and
stainless steels as materials for the first wall. It is demonstrated that alloy-
ing high-melting metals with T1 and Si (for niobiumo suppresses the mass transfer
of atoms of alloys to the covering over the 800-1200 °c temperature rnage. From
the viewpoint of mass transfer, of the shielding materials considered preference

is to be given to compounds based on aluminum.

[Abstract of article by Kalin, B.A., Kirilin, N.H., Skorov, D.N. and Chernov, I.I.]

[Text] A study is made of the radiation erosion of 0Khl6Nl$MZB stainless steel
in the austenitized and 20-percent cold-strained states when irradiated with

helium ions with energy of 20 keV at 200 °c over the dose range of (10 to 500)'
-10“ ions/m2. It 13 demonstrated that in the dose range studied the maximum

erosion coefficient was on the order of 0.5 at/ion when irradiating with a dose
of 1'1022 ion/m2 and was reduced'with an increase in the ion dose. with irradia-

tion doses higher than 2-102, ions/m2 the total erosion coefficient practically
equals the ateel's sputtering ratio. The influence of pretreatment on erosion of
the material is reduced with an increase in dose and is practically lacking with
high irradiation doses of (4 to 6)'1022 ions/m2.

[Text] By the methods of electron and field-ion microscopy studies were made of
changes in the structure and microrelief of the surface of tungsten under the
effect of irradiation with helium ions. A study was made by means of an electron
microscope of the influence on blistering of the original structure of the mater-
ial formed as the result of rolling and recrystallization annealing.

Comparison of structures formed on the surface of tungsten as the result of
irradiation at room temperature and as the result of irradiation with subsequent
annealing demonstrated that no substantial difference was observed in the nature
of scouring. Measurements were made of the thickness of the scoured layer as a
function of the ion energy and a comparison was made of the thickness of covers
with calculated values of the mean free paths of helium ions in tungsten.

By means of a field-ion microscope a study was made of the atomic topography
of single crystals of tungsten irradiated with helium ions with energy of 0.1
to 3.0 keV over the dose range of 10H to 1017 cm-z. It was established that
with an irradiation dose of 10u to 10‘2 cm-2 the change in microtopography as
the result of the radiation effect is two orders of magnitude greater than the
form-alteration effect caused by erosion. Early stages of blister formation
were observed with doses of 101 cm 2 and higher; the blisters measured 102 to
103 A. A study was made of the microstructure of irradiated tungsten by means
of the method of field-controlled layer-by-layer sublimation.

INTERACTION OF CARBON (GRAPHITE AND DIAMOND) COATINGS RITE THE HYDROGEN PLASMA

[Abstract of attitle by Fedoseyev, D.V., Deryagin, B.V., Tolmachev, {u.N.,
Bukhovets, V.L., Varnin, V.P. and Teremetskaya, 1.6.]

[Text] It has been proven that the application of a coating of an acetylene-
hydrogen plasma to char substantially reduces the rate of gasiticetion of the
char in a hydrogen plasma. The dependence of the rate of gasification of a
carbon coating in a hydrogen plasma on the temperature has a 550-900 °C section
in which the reaction rate is reduced with an increase in temperature. The
depth of penetration of the reaction into a layer of diamond powder coated with
graphite does not exceed 1 an with a particle size of 100 to 125 microns, which
is associated with the rapid recombination of hydrogen atoms in the powder layer.
In the interaction of polycrystalline graphite with a hydrogen plasma the amor-
phous component is gasified first, whereas graphite crystals are gasitied at a
considerably slower rate.

[Text] An electron microscope study is made of erosion of the surface of poly~
crystalline aluminum.and stainless steel of austenitic class EP-838 under the
effect of helium ions with energy of 10. 20 and 175 keV. The materials were
irradiated in the “Vezuviy” [Vesuvius] heavy ion accelerator, as well as directly
in the column of an EFZ-ZG field-emission microscope by means of a special

A study is made of the influence of postradiation annealing on the nature of
form modification and scouring of the surface of EP-838 steel. It has been
proven that increasing the temperature of the irradiated sample to 1200 'C re-
sults in an approximately sevenfold increase in the surface erosion coefficient.

A study is made of the influence of particle energy and the irradiation dose

on the nature of radiation damage to the surface in polycrystalline aluminum.

It is demonstrated that with low energies of helium ions (5 to 10 keV) the domi-
nant process is physical erosion of the irradiated surface, and with increased
energies (20 to 30 keV) the blistering effect. In the 5'10l7 to 1.7'10‘° ions/

In the case of neutron generators with a solid-state target (ions of deuterium
irradiate a metal target saturated with tritium), design solutions for neutron
generators are discussed, as well as the physics of processes taking place on the
irradiated surface (including questions relating to confining the tritium in the

tritium). processes of heat transfer from the reaction zone, the problem of

the entry of a powerful ion beam into a dense gas target and possible design so-
lutions for neutron generators are discussed.

[Abstract of article by Zakharov, A.P.]

[Text] By means of electron microscope methods, structural changes are. traced

in surface layers of molybdenum irradiated with low-energy hydrogen ions. In
studying processes of the penetration of hydrogen through a metal under conditions
of the plasma of a glow discharge, the effect of the radiation-accelerated diffu-
sion of hydrogen has been discovered, caused by the formation of an internal
interstitial atom - hydrogen atom dynamic complex with a dissociation energy of
approximately 2 eV. New possibilities for studying the distribution of light
implanted ions are offered by the method of layer-by-layer analysis by means of
erosion with argon ions. Because of its application it has been possible to

fix the position of ions in the lattice of a metal with various irradiation tem-
peratures and to reveal the phenomenon of the redistribution of helium found in
vacancies as the result of reaction with SAM-N complexes.

[Text] By means of a modified Formen-Meykin model the particular case of the
distribution of radiation defects in front of a moving dislocation is discussed,
namely, their ordered arrangement (the so-called superlattice of defects).

Since defects in exPerimentally observed superlattices are nonuniform in size,
it is to be expected that in interaction with a moving dislocation they will
behave differently. Within the framework of the model used an attempt is made
to take this effect into account, by introducing two sizes of point obstacles
and distributing them randomly over points of the superlattice.

another their metallographic and crystallographic textures vary substantially,
which makes it possible to isolate their contributions to the anisotropy of

on the anisotropy of brittle failure. the form and size of structural elements,

The principal nature of the anisotropy of brittle failure is determined by the

The nature of the anisotropy of brittle failure of welded joints is similar to

INFLUENCE OF THE SHAPE OF THE TRAILING EDGE OF A SECTION ON THE HAGNITUDE 0P
LIP LOSSES

[Abstract of article by Deych, M.Ye., Lazarev, L.Ya. and Zhegalin, A.S.]

[Text] Experimental data are presented on traversing of the outlet field of the
stream of a plane vane cascade placed in a wind tunnel of the open type.

It is demonstrated that by adding cutouts to the trailing edge of the section of
a turbine blade the plane flow in the wake of the lip is transformed into 3-di-

mensional flow consisting of individual three-dimensional wakes interacting with
one another.

INFLUENCE OF SMALL AMOUNTS 0F POLYMER ADDITIVBS INTRODUCED INTO STREAM 0N HYDRO-
DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF FLAT AIRFOILS

Moscow [ZVESTIYA AKADBMII NAUK SSSR: HBKHANIKA ZHIDKOSTI I GAZA in Russian N0 6,
Nov-Dec 81 (manuscript received 30 Apr 80) pp 35-41

[Article by V.V. Droblenkov and 6.1. Kanevskiyl

[Text] This article considers the undetached flow of weak homo-
geneous polymer solutions past flat airfoils. To solve the prob-
lem, the stream is divided into two regions by the interface be-
tween the boundary layer and wake: the acne of potential flow and
that of viscous liquid flow (i.e., the boundary layer and wake,
whose characteristics are continuously contiguous at the inter-
face).

After the stream is divided into two components, the problem is
solved by successive approximation, taking into account the inter-
action of the two regions. The influence of the zone of potential
flow on that of viscous flow is incorporated through the pressure
distribution at the interface of the boundary layer and wake.

That of the viscous flow cemponent is taken into account by in-
troducing an additional eddy whose strength equals the vorticity
integral over the entire viscous regiOn and additional velocities
at the wake-boundary layer interface that deform the streamlines
in the potential flow region and bring them into conformity with
the flow pattern in a real liquid.

The results yielded by calculatioa of hydrodynamic characteristics
for a Zhukovskiy-type airfoil are coapared with experimental
data. The influence of introduction of small amounts of polymer
additives into the stream on the distributed and integrated flow
characteristics for a number of Reynolds numbers is analysed for
a modified NACA66 profile.

. The boundary-layer parameters for the upper and lower surfaces of an airfoil are
alculated separately, using the integral-relationship method [I], which takes into
account the laminar. transitional, and turbulent flow zones in the layer. The pre-
sence of small amounts of polymer additives in the stream is taken into considera-
tion by using the Meyer correlatioa for the longitudinal velocity component u in the

the Cowles parameter, 6 is the thickness of the boundary layer, B is a parameter

that takes into account the properties of the dissolved polymer and its concentration
in the solution, and v0* is the dynamic velocity corresponding to the point at which

the Thoms effect develops.

The characteristics of the turbulent wake beyond the airfoil are determined sepa-

rately for its upper and lower portions, using the integral method [3]. The axis

of the wake is assumed to be the zero-deflection streamline in an ideal liquid for
a predetermined velocity circulation around the airfoil. The distributions of the
longitudinal flow-speed component u and the tangential stresses 1 in the wake are

approximated by the relationships

 

—=I-(I-—:){«—vexp(-£‘;—’> ;3(«+«» 1—“)1

Here ”6 is-the longitudinal flow-speed component at the outer boundary of the wake,
Um is the flow speed at the wake axis, k and y are wake parameters that vary along
the length of the wake, p is the density of the liquid, and Kl is the turbulent

viscosity coefficient, which also varies along the length of the wake.

Assuming the influence of small amounts of polymer additives to consist solely in
reorganisation of turbulent exchange in the immediate vicinity of the surface around
which the stream flows and to have no direct action on the free turbulence, we pro-
ceed on the premise that the entire influence of the additives on flow characteris-
tics in the wake is taken into account in the changes in the initial data employed
for its calculation. The initial parameter values for the upper and lover portions
of the wake are determined from the continuity condition for the thickness 6, the
displacement distance 6*, the momentum-loss distance 6**, and the maximum tangential
stresses for the transition from the boundary layer to the wake.

In order to determine the position of the interface between the viscous and non-
viscous flow zones, the thickness of the boundary layer (wake) is laid off along
perpendiculars to the airfoil surface or wake axis. The resultant boundary is
smoothed by fitting to cubic parabolas in the immediate vicinity of the trailing
edge of the airfoil.

The characteristics of the potential flow component are calculated by using the
~heory of conformal mapping. A profile of the desired shape is laid out on the
physical plane a and a circle of radius a is laid out on the auxiliary plane c.
The mapping function relating the two complex planes has the form of the Laurent
series

(1.4) “UV-+2. m-r'

Its coefficients are calculated by the method described by Zavadovskiy and Rusets-
kiy la].

The complex flow potential is divided into two terms, the first of which is associ-
ated with the circulation of an ideal liquid around the airfoil and the second with
the additional velocities that provide the displacement of the streamlines necessary
in order for the influence of viscosity to be taken into consideration:

lV-=PV(+IV. P
(1.5) W.—l; oxp(—iu)+a'§" exp(ia)+2—1-‘_—ln§

here a is the angle of attack and F is the circulation of the additional eddy.

The condition for determination of the calculated circulation in the viscous liquid
is the requirement that the vortical flows converging [ram the upper and lower sur-
faces of the airfoil in the wake be equal, which was first proposed by Taylor in

I924 Isl. In the wake, the condition that the vortical flows calculated for its
upper and lower portions be equal is equivalent to the requirement that the pressures
at the wake axis be continuous:

I. O.
(1.6) 1.“: jm.udy.=I--2je.udy.: pu-m-

where I is the vortical flow through the wake cross-section, wz is the vorticity at
.he point in questioa. and p0 is the pressure at the wake axis; the plus and minus

:ubscripts pertain to the upper and lover portions of the wake respectively.

Jeglecting the change in pressure across the wake, we obtain V5+ - V6_ for the
)dulus of the velocity vector V6 at the outer boundary of the wake. when applied

”0 points at the outer limit of the boundary layer corresponding to the trailing
:dge of the airfoil (the initial cross-section of the wake). this relationship can
:lso be employed to determine the calculated circulation.

n order to provide the requisite displacement of the streamlines in the potential
wrtion of the stream, bringing them into conformity with the flow pattern in a real
iquid, a system of inflows and drains is laid out at the surface of the airfoil

yd the wake axis; their flow rates are determined in the linear-theory approxima-
;on, from the condition sz - Avn, where Avn are the additional normal velocities

Here x it the longitudinal coordinate. The subscripts I and 2 are for the parameters
determined in viscous and ideal liquids respectively.

Equation (1.7) contains the unknown V6, and the quantities 5 and 6* dependent on it,

so that the problem of determining the additional velocities produced by the recipro-
cal influence of the viscous flow zene on the potential flow is solved by the suc-
cessive-approximatiOn method.

In order to detennine the circulation integral for the additional eddy in the via-
cous liquid, the flow parameters are calculated for a series of values of F and the
circulation integral for which the condition “5+ - VG- is satisfied is then faund.

The resultant circulation figure is employed for recalculation of the distributed
hydrodynamic characteristics of the airfoil by which the viscous liquid flows. For
each circulation value, the flow parameters are determined in a sequence of itera-
tions that includes calculation of the characteristics of the ideal liquid, boundary
layer, and wake and their interaction. A relaxation constant of 0.5 is introduced

to ensure convergence of the successive-approximation process in calculating the
velocities at the interface bevteen the two flow zones. The successive-approximation
procedure is terminated on satisfaction of the condition

In Eq. (1.8), the velocities V6 are determined for points corresponding to the
trailing edge of the airfoil, while the superscript k represents the iteration number.
After determination of the calculated circulation integral and the characteristics

of the boundary layer and wake, the lift coefficients Cy, the profile drag cx, and

The [actor 10" is omitted for all the drag coefficients in Table I and henceforth.
In accordance with the experimental conditions employed by Preston and Sweating [7].
the calculations were made for a de tee of free turbulence e - 1.75 percent and a
Reynolds number Re - UQL/v - 6.2'l0 . For purposes of comparison, Table I also
givos the lift coefficients calculated for flow of an ideal liquid past the airfoil
(Cuz). Figure 1 compares the distributions calculated for the pressure coefficient

q at rte outer limit of the boundary layer with the results of pressure measurements
made at he airfoil surface with the aid of drainage tubes. Curves I-3 and experi-
mental points 4-6 are for angles of attack a of 0, 3, and 6° respectively. This
figure also compares the calculated (curves 7-9) and experimentally determined
(points IO-IZ [7]) dimensionless values of the momentum-loss thickness 6**/L. Curve
7 and point ID are for an angle of attack a - 0, curve 8 and point II are for a - 6°
and the upper surface of the airfoil, and curve 9 and point 12 are for a - 6° and
the lower surface of the airfoil.

The results given indicate satisfactory agreement between the calculated and experi-
mental data [or both the force parameters and the distributed hydrodynamic charac-
teristics.

in order to analyze the influence of introduction of small amounts of polymer addi-
tives into the stream on the hydrodynamic characteristics of flat airfoils, we made
systematic calculations for a laminarized NACA66 airfoil with a relative thickness

of 5 percent and a curvature of 1 percent.

The calculations were carried out for Reynolds numbers of 6'IO‘ and 3'l07 with angles
of attack of -3, 0, 1.5, and 3°. We assumed L - I m and "O - 9 m/sec with Re - 6'l0‘

and L = 1.6 m and U0 - 30 m/sec with Re - 3'107. The value of v0* was assumed to

be 0.023 m/sec and the parameter 8 was assigned values of 0, 2.5, 4.34, and 7.5,
which roughly corresponded to flow of homogeneous aqueous solutions of HSR-30l poly-
ethylene oxide with concentrations of 0.5, IO, and 25 ppm past the airfoil. The
degree of free turbulence was presumed to equal 2% in all the calculations.

Figures 2 and 3 show the distributiOn of the pressure coefficient over the airfoil

in a nbnviscous liquid (curves 1) and over the u;:er limit of the boundary layer

in a Viacous liquid at Re a 6'I0‘ and B = 0 (curves 2) and at Re - 6'106 and 8 - 6.36
(curves 3). All the results are for flow past the profile with a - 3°.

Equidistant displacement of the q curves corresponding to flow of a viscous liquid
past the airfoil in relation to the curves calculated for a nonviseous liquid was
observed over virtually the entire length of the airfoil. except for the extreme
tip and rail regions. Introduction of polymer additives into the stream caused the
calculated pressure coefficients q to approximate to the values corresponding to
flow of a nonviscous liquid past the airfoil. A quite substantial pressure redis-
tribution resulting from the appearance of viscosity forces was observed in the vici-
nity of the leading—edge critical point. It must be noted that, according to our
calculations, introduction of small amounts of polymer additives into the stream
should not lead to any perceptible change in the decompression peak near the tip

of the airfoil- In the immediate vicinity of the trailing edge, q underwent a
change from I in a nonviscous liquid to 0.12-0.lb in a viscous liquid.

Figure 4 represents the distribution of the momentum-loss thickness in the boundary
layer and wake beyond the NACA66 airfoil. The results were obtained for Re - 6 10
and a I 3°. Curves l and 2 correspond to the values of 6**/L obtained for the upper
and lover surfaces of the airfoil with B - 0 and curves 3 and 4 correspond to those
obtained for these surfaces with B - 4o 34. The influence of polymer additives re-
sulted in a substantial reductiOn in the momentum-loss thickness 6** in the regions
occupied by the turbulent boundary layer and wake.

The results yielded by calculation of Cx, Cy. and C“I for the NACA66 airfoil are given

in Table 2. The values found for the lift coefficient and mementum coefficient in
a nonviscous liquid with a - -3, o, n.5, and 3° were cyz - -0.21I6, 0.1312. 0.3026,

and 0.4737 and Cm2 - -0.0246. 0.0645. 0.1099. and 0.1533 respectively. These data
show that the dependence of Cy on the angle of attack in a viscous liquid remained

linear. An increase in the Reynolds number or introduction of small amunts of poly-
mer additives into the stream caused Cy and CuI to change in such fashion that they

approximated to the corresponding figures found in a nonviscous liquid. The drag
coefficient cx decreased as the Reynolds number ruse and fell sharply when polymer

additives were introduced into the stream. An increase in the polymer cancentration
in the solution produced a larger change in all the integral hydrodynamic character-
istics of the airfoil. It must he noted that the polymer additives had their strong-
est effect on the profile drag. causing only minor changes in the lift and hydrody-
namic momentum of the airfoil.

[Text] This collection includes papers from two departments of the Energy Physics
l-‘aculty--Cryogenic Engineering and Engineering Thermal Physics--as well as fron
the Heat-and-Hass Transfer Processes and Apparatus Department of the Industrial
Heat and Power Faculty.

The first group of papers contained in this collection directly concerns problems
arising in the calculation and design of cryogenic apparatus and machines. Papers
of this group include an analysis of influx of heat in microcryogenic throttling
systems; calculation of solid phase - liquid equilibrium for mixtures of nitrogen
with saturated hydrocarbons at low temperatures; analysis of the influence of

the ratio of the overall dimensions of the low-temperature unit on the magiitude
of losses from the influx of heat through the insulation; an analysis of factors
determining the energy efficiency of a thermomechanical pump for low-tenperature
products; and an evaluation of the feasibility of using jet pumps for transferring
liquefied natural gases.

The second group is made up of experimental works relating to the study of heat
transfer in thermosiphons of the slotted type and in a closed evaporation-condensa-
tion system with separate channels for the liquid and steam.

Papers included in the third group concern general questions of heat transfer.
Hethods are discussed for a numerical solution to problems of heat transfer with
free laminar convection around a vertical plate for helium in the supercritical

region of parameters and with the flow of an incompressible fluid around a moving
surface.

Questions relating to heat transfer in He-II are represented in papers in which

ANALYSIS OF INFLUX OF HEAT IN HICROCRYOGBNIC THRO’I‘TLING SYSTEMS

[Abstract of article by Boyarskiy, H.Yu., Lunln, A.I., Gusakov. A.G. and
Aloyan, 0.8.]

[Text] It is demonstrated that in calculating the influx of heat in microcryo-
genic throttling systems it is necessary to take into account heat transfer between
the reverse flow and resistance thermometer bridges. The procedure is based on
solving differential equations describing the change in temperatures of the forward
and reverse flows and of the resistance thermometer bridge along the length of

the low-temperature unit, taking into account the influx of heat through the in-
aulation. The system of equations was solved by the approximtion-iterstion
method on an MIR-2 computer. Comparison of the calculation results with experi-
mental data for a refrigerator operating on nitrogen has confirmed the appropriate-
ness of the calculation method suggested.

[Text] The results are given of a calculation of heat transfer with self-similar
flow in the laminar boundary layer of an incompressible fluid with a longitudinal
pressure gradient when the longitudinal component at the well does not equal zero.
The influence of the speed of the surface, its direction and pressure gradient

on the local heat flux density and the heat transfer parameter is demonstrated.
For the limiting case of equality of velocities in the nonturbulent flow and at
the wall the analytical relationships for heat transfer in the field of nomviscous
flow agree well with the numerical calculation.
