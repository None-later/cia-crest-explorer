[Text] Results of an experimental study are presented pertaining to
transient heat transfer during flow of a water stream through a cutout in
a plate. The test data have been processed on the basis of a nuaericel
solution to the reverse heat-conduction problem (correctly formulated)

and by implementation of an implicit finite-difference algorithm on a digital
computer. For better eccuracy of this data processing. the input data
were smoothed by means of a spline approximation of the teepereture
readings with smooth functions. Experiments have demonstrated that numeri-
cal processing of test data can produce successful results in a study

of transient heat transfer at the turbine blades of gas turbine engines.

[Text] Analytical relations are derived for the additional losses due to
inefficient streamlining of turbine blades. as a consequence of a circum-
ferentially nonuniform temperature field. These relations for the additional

losses are useful for more precisely designing a turbine and profiling the
blade arrays. Figures 3; references 6.

affect the process of liquid evaporation in a gas strean. This nethod is
based on the one-dimensional theory of two-phase flow. An steeple is shown
to illustrate the calculation of the process parameters in the exit channel
of a gas turbine plant with injection of a liquid for cooling purposes.

[Text] An examination is made of the problem of incompressible viscous
fluid flov around a permeable sphere at low Reynoles numbers. The velocity
distribution of the injected fluid is given in such a way that the maximum
value of injection velocity is reached on the upstream side of the sphere.
It is assumed that the maxi-.5. blow-in velocity is of the same order as the
velocity of the oncoming flow, and that the physical properties of the
injected fluid and the oncoming flov are the same. The problem was solved
by the method of splicing asymptotic solutions. The distribution of veloci-
ties and pressure is-found in the vicinity of the sphere in the second
approximation. It is shown that nonuniformity of radial blow-in increases
the drag of the sphere. Iigures S.

[Text] The paper gives the results of an experinentel study of the
turbulence characteristics of a jet at different angles of attack against a
flat surfece. It is shown that with an increase in the angle of attack there
is an increase in the turbulence level along the axis of the jet. while the
naxinun level of turbulence along the axis shifts toward the nozzle tip.

In transverse cross sections of a jet in the horizontal plane, the level of
turbulence with respect to width of the jet approxinately triples. and in

the vertical plane it doubles as compared with the value along the axis.

end global properties of the processes that take plece in the lunatic systu

established between the duration of correction and the parameters of the
eystes; channel coupling coefficients are introduced that enable a quanti-

It is proved that the solution of these problem with a controlling function

[Text] An examination is made of an algorithm for flightcraft notion
control realized by an airborne digital computer by changing the angle of
attack for tracking longitudinal range and changing the angle of banking
for tracking lateral range. It is assumed that thrust is equal to zero.
flight takes place in the stsosphere of a spherical non-rotating planet.
and control cos-ands are sent at discrete nonents of time. For situations
in which it is impossible to cospensate for mismatch with respect to
lateral range without introducing perturbations in the longitudinal

range channel it is proposed that one of three fixed controlling actions
with respect to banking be selected (zero, positive. negative) such that a
ninimun specially constructed utility function is realized that accounts
for deviations from the noninal trajectory with respect to longitudinal
and lateral ranges and other parameters. The weighting coefficients for
individual parameters are selected on the basis of expert estinates.

ion been by transverse displacenent of an accelerating electrode for
different degrees of deceleration end positions of the plsne of neutraliza-
tion. It is shown that when the plane of neutralization in very far free
the accelerating electrode and the degree of deceleration is low the
observed deflection of the ion been agrees well with the results of calcu-
lation. At short distances to the plane of neutralization and for high
degrees of deceleration appreciable been deflection takes place beyond the
accelerating electrode and in thin cese the experinentel dste agree with
the results of modeling. Hssinun deflection of the ion been reached 35’.

problea is solved for a fluctuation field in such a systea. and correlation
functions are then constructed for fluctuation deviations of the density of
electron and ion charges from the statistically average values. An in-

[Text] The influence that the surface density of a converter target and the
primary radiation energy have on the signal/noise ratio is studied for the
process of X-rsy radioaetric fluorescent analysis with radio isotope ex-
citation. Results are presented from an experinental check of the theoreti-
cal assumptions used in separation of the lines of Ni K48 (against

the bac round of Fe M8) and Pb 143 (against the background of Zn MB)
using 10 Cd as a source and a type 81-611 proportional counter. It is shown
that the effectiveness of recording of. secondary radiation varies with
elenents with different values of 2 when excited by 109Cd for iron and sine
converter targets. Figures 5. References 9.
