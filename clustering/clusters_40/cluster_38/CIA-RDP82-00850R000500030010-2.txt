EQUIPMENT AND TOOLING FOR REPAIR OF CHANNEL TYPE AIOMIC REACTORS
Moscow ATOHNYYB ELEKTRICHBSKIYE STANTSII in Russian No 2. I979 pp 136-138
[Article by A. Ya. Shvets and A. G. Kuznetsov)

[Text] Operating experience with channel reactors has shown that working relia-
bility depends in great measure on the availability of a well conceived and developed
repair technique and reliably operating repair equipment and facilities.

The repair facilities for channel reactors differ from those for vessel reactors

in lower mass. but are much more complicated in their kinematic chains. Fittings
and attachments are worked out for a specific technological process. Some standar-
dization in equipment is achieved by using identical drives. grapplers and configu-
rations. Reactors at the Beloyarsk and Bilibino nuclear electric plants are struc-
turally quite different. and each plant has its own technological processes and
repair facilities. The Bnergiya Scientific Production Association in cooperation
with the Beloyarsk and Kursk nuclear power plants is doing research on developing
new technology for repairing reactors and individual components. In conformity
with the new technology. a great number of repair facilities and devices are now
being developed and made.

In extraction of the process channels at the BAES [expansion not given] nuclear
electric plant. there was a possibility of wedging. A device was made for cutting
off a partly extracted and wedged channel. Before the channel is extracted. the
device is installed on its head and connected to a remote control system. As the
channel is being extracted. the device is raised to a certain height and follows
along with the channel as it moves. In case of necessity. the operator can use
remotely controlled clamps to fasten the attachment to the channel and sever it
with a cutting tool. In case the cutting tool breaks. a spare cutting head is
provided on the attachment.

when extracting process channels that are situated alongside the channels of the
reactor control system. the available cutting tools cannot be used to cut off the
head because the clearances are very small. To do this operation. devices have
been made for cutting off the head right down to where the steam chamber is opened.
The cutting is done by a core drill with automatic feed. Working tine of the at-
tachment is 30 minutes.

Extraction of shut-down channels required containers for transportation. These
containers are made with double walls between which iron shot is poured.

Since extraction 0! emergency luel elements involves crumbling oi the fuel. devices
luvc been developed for cleaning the cells with the use of both mechanical devices
and hydraulic heads. In mechanical cleaning of the cell the devices had reliable
packing preventing emission of contaminated particles into the central building.
Brushes were moved by a machine tool.

To free the tubes of the fuel elements from the steam chamber of the process channel
heads. a drilling head was developed enabling simultaneously drilling out three
tubes. A distinguishing feature of this head is the close spacing of holes. The
drill is rotated by a central distribution gear. The gear is driven by a series-
produced pneumatic machine.

The consideratle experience accumulated by Leningrad Nuclear Electric Plant in
repairs of RBHK-Z reactors enables determination of the most feasible solutions
in designing repair equipment and facilities.

At Energiya Scientific Production Association. research has been done on developing
a set of attachemnts for repair of process channels. The following devices have
been developed: for cutting off a whisker joint. for replacing an extracted part
of a valve. for extracting a process channel. and for cutting off the head of the
reactor control system.

In the process of reactor operation. it has been found that the installed weld

of the stack may be broken. For this case. technology has been developed for block-
ing the process channel and replacing the stack. To perform these operations.

the following devices have been developed:

1) for electric-contact cutting of the steam-water lines;

2) for cutting the stack;

3) for dressing the seam of the stack;

4) for turning down 0 121;

5) grabs for transporting the stack;

6) separate centering devices and gages.

For welding in the new stack. a specialized organization has developed a welding
dcvire in cooperation with the Energiya Scientific Production Association that

welds in the new stack and provides the necessary reinforcement.

Nuclear power plants Shauld give serious consideration to preparation of attachments
and devices for performing operations. To solve these problems at the Kursk Nuclear
Electric Plant. two stands have been developed: a stand that simulates the stark
zone. and a full-scale trainer stand for adjustments of all kinds of tools and
instruments. Considerable headroom is needed for the latter stand.

This stand is accommodated in the central building. The stand has four channels.

which brings the facility very close to reality. Since the stand is quite high
(more than 16 m), the metal structural components are made in sections. Erection

of the structural components is started on the floor level of the central building.
and the metal structure is lowered as production proceeds. The channel simulators
are installed last. These are of tubular design with interchangeable elements.
Replacement of elements is simple. and as a rule is done without disassembling

the channels. This solution is due to the fact that mechanical treatment of the
elements is done when adjusting tools. Some zones of the channel are cut out so
that the operation of the cutting heads can be observed. Graphite brickwork is
simulated in the stand. Special mechanisms are provided to create the effects

of destruction of the brickwork. These mechanisms can create effects of breaking
the rods of the brickwork. canting of individual elements and so on. The stand

is equipped with a large number of observation areas. Vertical ladders are provided
for access to these areas. All these areas have local lighting. compressed air
tubes and intake ventilation to provide the necessary exchange of air. 0n the

lower area of the stand is a rolling platform with a lifting table used to raise
tools for doing operations on the lower level of the reactor. Along the stand

is a shaft through which attachments are passed. The crane of the central building
is used to raise and lower tools and attachments.

The following technological processes can be done on the trainer stand: replacement
of a process channel. replacement of a casing. straightening graphite brickwork.
cleaning brickwork. The following devices are aligned on the stand: for measuring
the end displacement of a whisker weld. for cutting off the tubes of the steam-
water lint. for extracting a process channel. for extracting reactor control rods
when the cable breaks, for extracting a thermoc0up1e. for Cutting off the upper

REPAIR EQUIPMENT AND TOOLING FOR VESSEL TYPE AIOHIC REACTORS

Moscow ATOHNYYE ELEKTRICHESKIYE STANTSII in Russian No 2. 1979 pp 132-136

[Article by A. Ya. Shvets and A. G. Kuznetsov]

[Texti Years of operating experience with vessel type nuclear reactors have shown
that successful use necessitates development of a complex of devices enabling in-
spection and repair of the reactor vessels and equipment inside the vessel. The
All-Union Heat Engineering Institute imeni P. E. Dzerzhinskiy has developed a thick-
walled container for vessel inspection. An operator inside the container inspects
the inner walls of the vessel through inspection ports along a helical line around
the walls of the container. But experience has shown that it is difficult to lake
repairs on vessels as the container has no vertical drive. Lack of a drive makes
it necessary to move tools and attachments through passageways located at different
heights. which is difficult to do in a restricted space. For the Kola Nuclear
Electric Plant. engineering plans were developed for an autonomous container. and
from these plans the Energiya Scientific Production Association made two versions
of devices for inspection and repair of reactor vessels-~the URK-l and URK-Z. The
first one is now in use at the Kola Nuclear Electric Plant. The URK-l facility

for inspection and repair of a reactor vessel is a cab that carries two operators.
who are protected from radiation exposure by double steel walls between which lead
shot is poured. Shielded inspection ports made of special glass are provided in
the walls and floor of the cab. The cab is equipped with the Krug-Z device that
enables mechanical treatment of the inside walls'of the reactor. In addition.
there are passageways in the walls of the cab through which hose manipulators can
be operated when necessary. In the bottom of the cab is a hatch that can be opens
for access Lo the reactor floor. There is a block and tackle with lifting capacl.y
of 0.5 metric ion for raising the hatch and for lowering heavy items from the corn
tainer to the floor.

Inspection and repair in the vicinity of the upper branch pipes are done through
an extension tube with sliding door. There is an inspection port in the door.

The cab is equipped with intake ventilation for adequate air exchange and slight
pressurization. Since the operators in the cab must work in pressuirzed suits.
the cab has an air supply for breathing. The zone of inspection is illuminated

by spotlights controlled from inside the cab. The cab contains a local control
panel and telephone equipment, and there is a recess for installing nondestructive
inspection devices. The radiation environment is monitored inside the cab and

on its outside walls by dosimeters that send readings to a central control panel.

18

The operators enter the cab through a vertical hatch. descending by a ladder. The
hatch is composite. made up of two sections; conduits and ducts pass inside the
hatch (airways. electrical. monitoring and measurement instrumentation conduits).
Commutation of electrical equipment is done by plugs. The hatch is square in shape
and has double walls. Lead sheets are packed between the walls. The hatch is
attached to the cab by pins. and the whole unit can be located in the vertical
plane in any of eight positions 1200 mm apart. The outerwwlls of the hatch are
provided with lugs for fixing in these positions. Falling into these lugs are
longitudinal shafts mounted in levers that pivot on pins set in two rockers. Sus—
pended from these same rockers are four pneumatic cylinders with rods secured to
stationary brackets. Hhen compressed air is fed to the cylinders. the rods move
out and rotate the levers. freeing the lugs of the hatch. but this can occur only
if the logs are somewhat elevated above the axles of the rocker arms. Disengagement
is impossible unless this elevation has taken place. This prevents accidental
freeing of the hatch and cab from the restraining device.

lo case of necessity. the cab can be raised to the extreme upper position and fixed
there even in the absence of compressed air. For this purpose. beneath the lugs

on the walls are bevels over which the shafts will be brought out of engagement

as the cab and hatch are raised. The cab restraint system is installed on a rotat-
ing frame that bears on a base thrOugh a support bearing. The frame is rotated

by a gear train driven by an electric motor. The rotating frame and base have
radiation shielding. For installation of the facility. ears are provided in the
upper section of the hatch into which pins fit that engage with a crossbeam carried
by a hook on the crane of the central reactor building.

For doing inspections and repairs on the vessel. the URK-l is first assembled with
the hatch and rocating platform on a special stand; by means of the crossbeam.

the assembled container is grapsed by the crane of the central building. and placed
in the reactor. In doing this. the cab may be placed in any of the eight positions.
The positions are selected so that neighboring inspection zones overlap. During
inspection and repair in a single position. the hook of the crane is disengaged
from the crossbeam. in case of necessity. an operator can rotate the cab through
360°. and stop it at the point required for inspection and repair.

Changing from one position to another is handled by the crane of the central build-
ing. The operators working in the cab must leave it during this change. The walls
and floor of the cab and hatch have a covering that can be decontaminated. The
total mass of the facility is 137 metric tons. The overall dimensions of the cab.
hatch and platform permit railroad transportation. The lead shot is removed during
transportation. The mass of the heaviest component in this case is 15 metric tons.

Utilization of the URK-l has enabled precise determination of the radiation environ-
ment inside the cab. as well as evaluation of convenience of servicing and technical
capabilities. These results have been the basis for a second model of the container
--the URK—2--with design and development incorporating the following changes:

the cab is raised and lowered by an autonomous hoisting mechanism with all its
actuating elements in the "clean" zone so that they can be serviced by repair person-
nel when the container has been lowered into the reactor; mounted in the cab is

the Krug-l device that enables mechanical treatment of the walls and floor of the
reactor with control from the cab; shielding thickness has been increased; provisions
have been made for doing inspection operations on the vessel with nondestructive
monitoring equipment.

Passageways for installation of additi~nal repair attachments are provided in the
walls of the cab. Construction of the URK-Z is comparatively simple. and it is
designed for repair under nuclear electric plant conditions.

For doing jobs on inspection and repair of reactor vessels, the URK-Z is assembled

on a scaffolding. The hook of the crane of the central building that is used to

lift the crossbeam has a hoisting capacity of 250 metric tons. The hook raises

the facility above the scaffold and transports it to the reactor. After the facility
has been lined up over the reactor. it is lowered until it is stopped by the joining
with the reactor. After the URK-Z container has been installed on the main joining.
the crossbeam is disengaged from the hatch. and set aside in the central building.
The container is connected to the life support systems. power supply. compressed

air. to the central control panel and systems for communication. television. moni-
toring and measurement instrumentation and radiation monitoring systems.

From this instant the facility is considered ready for operation. Elevation and
rotation of the cab can be controlled from the central or local panel. Since the
hoisting mechanism is a step-by-step type. raising and lowering are done in stages.
all operations of staged raising and lowering being done automatically. In case

of necessity. the cab can be raised by the crane of the central building. The
hoisting mechanism is backed up by a second interlocking system that enables smmoth
deseent of the cab to a lower position. The operator controls the mechanisms from
the local control panel. and can set the cab in any place to be inspected and re-
paired.

To inspect and repair the bottom of the shaft. a container has been developed that
is a square chamber with rollers installed on the bottom. A vertical tilter is
placed on the rollers that is rotated from two chains wound on a drum that is turned
by a worm drive. The worm is turned manually. welded inside the tilter are two
horizontal strips: one for installing bottom plates of the V-210 reactor. and

the other for VVER—440 reactors. For shielding servicing personnel. the chamber

is filled with water. and the top of the reactor is covered with additional shield-
ing plates. Inspection and repair of bottom plates is done from above. In doing
this. one plate is removed that is situated opposite the row of shielding tubes

to be repaired. in case of necessity. the tilter is turned through the required
angle (up to 180°). enabling inspection and repair of the top and bottom of the
cover.

To replace shielding tubes in the V—ZlO reactor. a device has been developed for
cutting the weld of the shielding tube and breaking it. The weld is cut by cutters
Installed in a cutting head. The cutting head is turned by a pneumatic motor through
a gear train.

Fur extracting the reactor shaft. 3 special device has been developed that is a
platform with vertical walls. The bottom and walls of the platform are thickened

to reduce the radiation background. The platform carries four brackets in whirh
there are two extensible shafts apiece. The brackets can change position within

a range of 2-3'. Gates are made in the walls. through which the straps that hold
the shaft against the vessel can be clamped and released. The platform is suspended
on four bars fastened to a cruciform crossbeam. The ends of the crossbeam terminate
in hydraulic jacks. 0n the crossbeam is an eyebolt to engage the hook of the crane

of the central building. Between the crossbeam and platform is a ladder by which
servicing personnel can descend to the platform.

To remove the shaft, the device is lowered by the crane of the central building
into the reactor until it is stopped by contact of the hydraulic jacks with the
main joining. Then the shafts are extended. In case they do not line up with

the holes in the shaft, screw jacks are used to shift the brackets until the shafts
line up with the holes. After all shafts have been fixed in position. the gates
are opened and the straps are unfastened. The straps are stacked on the platform.
and the repair personnel leave. The hydraulic jacks are then used to break the
shaft loose. which may require a force of up to 50 metric tons. The crane of the
central building is used to hoist and remove the shaft.

At nuclear electric plants it is important to reduce the anume of soft radioactive
waste that must be disposed of by burial. It is difficult to use existing presses

for this purpose as they are cunbsersome and are not ndaptible to decontamination.
Because of this. the "Briket-l" press has been deveiuped for cumpuctiug radioactive
waste. This press reduces the volume of soft wastes hy eightfold. The ram develops
a force of 32 metric tons. All components of the prvss that rume into contact

with radioactive waste are made of stainless steel. lhe p:cns is remotely controlled.
The compacted waste is manually banded. and ejetled by u hnlizunlul hydraulic cylin-
der. The press masses three metric tons and takes up I2 sq m of space.

HALF-SCALE MODELING DEVICE FOR EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF A MANIPULATION ROBOT

[Abstract of article by Dorotov. V. V.. Hoiseyenkov. V. A.. Rakhmanov. Ye. V. and
Shvedov. V. ".1

[Text] This work deals with the application of a method of physical modeling in the

process of designing manipulation systems. The use of physical models makes it pos-
sible to check not only the basic characteristics of the system under study. but to

test its components and assemblies as well. As an example the work looks at variants

ITuAlI This monograph presents the results of theoretical and experimental studies of
the electrophysical and thermophysical processes occurring in arcs burning in plasmo-
trons with MEV [interelectrode inserts]. Pulsation characteristics f a turbulent flow

with an arc burning in it are measured; data are presented on the electrical field in-
lvnslty of an arc in a turbulent gas flow. Set forth as well are the theoretical'basis

and results of experimental studies of heat exchange between the arc and the gas flow
and of the use of slot injection and the injection of gas through the porous wall of
the MEV to increase plasmotron thermal efficiency and output. The work discusses the
effect of the application of an external magnetic field on electric arc characteristics

and a number of special types of plasmotrons with MEV (plasmotrons with gas-vortex HEV.
canposite HEV etc.). Material presented here may provide a basis for the development of
efficient high-enthalpy generators of low-temperature plasma.

The hunk is intended lnr scientists. engineers and students in institutions of higher
education specializing in the field of the study and use of low-temperature plasma.
