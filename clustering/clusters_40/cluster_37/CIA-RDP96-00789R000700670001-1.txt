SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

The target is a person. This person is a male in his
late thirties maybe early forties. He is presently
traveling alone in the vicinity of New Mexico and Arizona.
He is headed west in a small sports car (appears to be a
Porche or a Corvette). HE is in desert surroundings,
driving on a two lane road with mountains to his right. He
is alone and looks clean shaven. His hair is longer than
usual and he insists on wearing dark glasses almost
constantly in public. He is greatly concerned -- there are
others besides the law that are looking for him.

His hope is that someone he knows on the west coast

will help him.
