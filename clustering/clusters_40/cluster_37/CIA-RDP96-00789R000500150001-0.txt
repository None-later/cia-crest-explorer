if you are brave you may drive down 92 untill you are parallel to the greenhouses and park just off the
road. Walk over to the greenhouses.

Target: The target is this group of greenhouses. The greenhouses are located in a long valley. There are
rolling green hills on each side of the valley (running roughly from East to West). The greenhouses have
geometrical shapes. They are constructed of square panes of glass fit into either wood or metal frames.
Many of the side walls of the greenhouses are connected. and the roofs are kind of triangular shaped.
The greenhouses are surrounded by fields with green plants growing in them. Through the glass panes
plants can be seen growing inside the greenhouses. There are white doors with nine panes of glass set in
the top half of them at the ends of the greenhouses.
