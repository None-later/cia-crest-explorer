Paris JEUNE “arms in French no 1085, 21 Oct 81 pp 18-21
[Article by Sennen Andriamirado: "Senegal: 1. Bade cuncyz")

[Text] A police investigation has revealed that the PBS
[Senegalese Danncratic Party] had a "Military Council" in
liaison with Libya. mat is the truth in this?

”We brought weapons into Senegal from Mauritania end the Mauritanian Government
knew it. we crossed the river at Rosso (northeast) and handed over 60,000 CPA
francs to the boatnan. Once on the Senegalese shore at Saint Louis, we paid
150,000 CPA francs to the customs officer. 011 5 August, we hid the weapons at
Keur Nasser (about 25 kilo-stars from Dakar) in the orchard of Wade (lawyer).
We went back to get them on 7 August so we could distribute them throughout the
regions."

This, in essence, is the reported admission of Amedou Fall, a former Senegalese
Army officer who was originally arrested (on 28 August) for fraud and who called
himself a nether of a Military Council" (secret) of the PBS and bodyguard of
Abdoulaye Wade, national secretary general of the P08. Pall subsequently
recanted, stating that these "admissions" were reportedly forced out of him under
torture. however, given the seriousness of the revelations, the legal machinery
was already in motion. For the first time in 20 years in Senegal, a government
appears to apply the law to the letter to fight an opposition party. Questioning
of PBS members has been conducted on a large scale and, according to the Minister
of Justice, a preliminary investigation "concerning an attack on the security of
the state" was opened on 20 Septedaer.

On 12 September, i.e. less than a week after the alleged importation of the
weapons, police appeared at Wade's secondary residence in Keu lbssar. The villa
was thoroughly searched by the team headed by Lieutenant Diop. Abdoulaye Hade's
chauffeur and the property guard were arrested. Three workers who were picked up
on the premises were released the day after following an interrogation. Late in
the morning of Nonday, 14 September, police appeared at the PDS headquarters on
7 Tiong Street which also housee Hade's office. The latter was at that time out
of Dakar. Ousmane Ngon, deputy national secretary for foreign relations, Talla
Fall and Shaikh Tidiane Sene,’ the latter two mere employees in the office of the
politician-lawyer, reportedly attempted to prevent the search. They were isnedi-
ately taken away and were subsequently charged with resisting police authorities.

On Tuesday, 15 September, the police thought they had put their finger on the
"boss" of the famous PBS "Military Council," Allassane Siseoko, director of the
ISEFI [Senegalese Institute for Training and Information] who reportedly, together
with a certain Ndiak Dieng, channelled weapons from Mauritania with Andoa Fall.
Alassane Sissoko's home as well as the ISEFI offices were searched during the
entire day of Thursday, 17 September.

Also on Thursday, PDS regional officers were also questioned; Papa houses Paye
and Houses Ba of the Saint Louis counmal section; Boubacar Sall, chairman of

the Thies section; and especially Doudou Gears, deputy from Kolda and member of
the national secretariat whose parliamentary imnity was lifted on 1 October
prior to his arrest. Doudou Gamra also reportedly confessed. The list is not
complete and certain individuals who were released were once again questioned.
At the end of the first week of October, eight militants were charged, including
two former officers, Amadou Fall and Gena lbengue, and the deputy, Camra. The
PDS leaders showed calmess. Abdoulaye wade told us in Paris, "We have requested
our militants to be ready for the investigation and not to object to questioning."
He added, “The officers in charge of the investigation have not found any weapons
and they will not find any."

Presumptions were nevertheless strong if one were to believe certain high-ranking
PS [Socialist Party} officers in power. On 26 Septeaber, the political office
of President Abdou Diouf's party brought up the subject. However, to show the
split between government and party, no reference was made in the communique
published at the end of the meeting. Nevertheless, according to some indiscreet
remarks made, the PS leadership is convinced "that the affair is very serious ,"
and it is affirmed that from the admissions made "it is apparent that several
PDS militants reportedly had undergone training in the handling of explosives in
Libya." Confirmation of this was officially made on 1 October by the Hinister
of Justice. The word Libya has been let out and the specter cf Qadhdhafi floats
over Dakar. This doubtlessly explains the Senegalese goveruaent's vigorous
reaction.

The uneasiness of the Abdou Diouf team is real. This is not the first tine that
a Libyan network has been indicted in the region. In Senegal itself an "ayatollah"
showed up 2 years ago in Kaolack and proclaimed total war against the Leopold
Sedar Senghor regime....to begin in the first part of 1980. Nothing happened.

0n the other hand, neighboring Mauritania experienced grave difficulties that year
when Libyan liaison with certain high-ranking officials was discovered. Above
all, Senegal is not ready to forget the coup attempt in Cabin in With Dakar

has always seen Qadhdhafi's hand. The Senegalese have therefore remined on the
alert and it has sufficed that the revelations of a more or less shady character
would bring into play the self-defense reflea. The i—ediate objective: estab-
lish proof of a connection (military and financial) between the PBS and Tripoli.

To believe the PDS leaders, the investigation will not establish this proof.

The number two man in the party, Fara N'Diaye, told us, "The police searched my
office. I had a Libya file which they took away. However, the file contained
only ordinary documents. I was also in Libya 2 years ago on a very official
basis and I brought back, for exasple, Qadhdhafi's Green Book. How could this be

proof of compromise?" lbreover, the PBS does not hide the fact that it has
"noml" relations with Tripoli. Two years ago, a delegation of 14 party leaders
went to Libya. Included amng these leaders was, besides Abdoulaye Wade and Para
N'Diaye, Deputy Doudou Cal-rs, who is today presented as the link pin between
the PBS and Qadhdhafi.

Nevertheless, nothing-at least on the surfaceuhas as yet been able to be really
established. In the beginning of October, the investigation appears justified
only through the admissions nude. however, what belief can there be in the
latter?

The man who started the affair, Aldon Fall, the "conveyer of weapons," has
recanted. However, he had already gone too far when he introduced hiuelf as a
member of a Pns "Military Council." Mr Hade's party answers, ”We do not have a
Military Council. On the other hand, it is true that Amdou Pall was responsible
for the close protection of the secretary general." wade hinself nevertheless
recognizes that he acted with some "thoughtlessness" when he confided his security
to such a questionable character whom he now suspects as being an agitator infil-
traced into his ranks by his adversaries.

Amadou Fall was actually a lieutemnt in the Senegalese army. Para N'Diaye told
us that Pall had offered his services to the PBS by stating that "he had been
transferred to reserve duty in the army. he was discharged in Deceaber 1980."
However, according to military sources, Lieutenant Fall's name was stricken from
the army cadres list because he reportedly had been surprised in the act of photo-
copying documents of interest to national defense. Since that time, however,
according to Abdoulaye Wade, "tie has been drawing his salary from budget of the
army general staff." The army admits that 'he is actually receiving a pension

as a former officer."

In any case, Pall was at the side of the was secretary general in July. Not
without reason, the latter states that he needed security. However, the bodyguard
was led astray in a cannon case of fraud: an unpaid debt to a Dakar company to
which he had shown his officer card so as not to pay anything. hence, his arrest
"for fraud and unauthorized use of title" (he had to hand over his officer card
when he left the army).

According to some sources, it was while looking for this card that the officers
in charge of the investigation reportedly discovered the documents which led to
the suspicion of the PDS relations with Tripoli: military instruction handbooks
in Arabic “relating to sabotage techniques," and a "diary describing the life of
PBS militants in a training can) in Libya." Amadou Fall not only admits that he
brought weapons into Senegal but also that he reportedly underwent training in
Libya together with six PDS militants to be instructed in urban guerrilla warfare.
The [’08 affirms that it has acted in good faith: it is not a crime to go to
Libya. Nevertheless, Wade questions 'how Fall could have taken along with him
PDS militants to Libya." The PDS boss, in fact, now recognizes the fact that
some of his comrades could have gone to Qadhdhafi's country without his knowledge.
However, for him "the Amdaou Pall" affair is a provocation of certain elements of
the Socialist Party to discredit his own party. '11: agitator has been infiltrated

into our ranks. An attenpt is being made to establish that we are in the pay of
Libya." In fact, if proof could be established that the PDS has received
subsidies from a foreign power, that mold seen his death sentence. Para N'Diaye
told us, "All hypotheses are possible. Attelpts are perhaps being rude to divide
us by proving to us that our secretary general acted alone (with Libya implied)
without informing us of anything whatsoever.” Fara N'Diaye knows that he is
looked upon in Kakar not only as the ideal successor of “ads to head the PM but
also as more respected interlocutor in the eyes of President Abdou Diouf.

For the moment, however, the two PDS leaders are in basic agrealent: "Certain
bigwigs of the government or the Socialist Party want to liquidate us." For
Abdoulaye Wade, the maneuver is clear: "Everything is being done to discredit
us because they are afraid of us. Between new and the 1983 elections (presiden-
tial and legislative), certain parallel institutions want us to disappear. ‘l‘he
Socialist Party does not wand the PBS opposite it. It wants only small parties
as interlocutors." Hade considers the latter as "the remainder, that is the
theory," whereas the big parties are only the PS, the P08 and "the cell of
Marxists."

Either through machinations of the government or thoughtlessness of the opposi-
tion, the affair can now no longer be covered up. A dismissal of the case
pronounced by the ecurt would risk discrediting the goverment somewhat and
restoring the fortune of Wade who would not complain about that. If , on the
other hand, the thesis of Libyan collusion were to be proved, Senegalese demo-
cracy would suffer from it: some could profit from it by saying that the Africans
do not know how to practice damcracy. It would be all the more detrimental since
it all started not with the capture of a freedom fighter but with the arrest of

a swindler.

[Article by Mark August:

[Text]

SOUTH AFRICA‘S latest invasion of
Angola. and the developments following
that action. have effectively turned
Southern Africa into an even more vol-
stile and highly militarised sub-
continent - preparing the ground. as it
were. for more widespread. intensive and
bloodier battles to come.

It has done something else. it has
revealed to the world an alliancebetween
South Africa and the Reagan Administ-
ration of the United States which. despite
its predictability. is quite breathtaking
in its concept and so potentially danger-
ous it has been dubbed ”unholy” by some
Western nations as well as by most Afri-
can leaders.

The misadventure

The invasion has thrown light on the
direction of the hitherto vague Africa
policy of the United States. There is
growing evidence that the South African
action was undertaken. in part anyway.
as a result of current ultra-conservative
attitudes dominating 'Jie White House.
The Reagan Administration is consi-
dered by the South Africans to be amen-
able to the general thrust of its own
designs in Southern Africa.

South Africa's misadventure in Angola
has several aims. The Pretoria Govern-
ment. contrary to its tired claims that it
had mounted the operation in pursuit of
SWAPO guerrillas. is known to be set on
de-stabilising the Angolan Government
- and. indeed. some of the other indepen~
dent African governments in the region.

There are many who believe that Pro.
torts. which acts as if it hascortr bloriclte

"the Unholy Alliance in Action in Africa”

in the region. sees itself enacting the
same role as the lsraclis in the Middle
Beat. it has been noted in diplomatic
circles and by military analysts that
there are several striking similarities"
between recent aggressive actions of the
Soudi Africans and those of the lsraelis.
interestingly. the reaction by the US
Administration has also tended to be
similar in both situations.

Like the lsraelis. who have installed a

surrogate Christian Lebanese presence
in South Lebanon led by Major Sa'ad
Haddad. Pretoria appears to have plan-
nedthat the pliant Jonu Savimbi. leader
of the rebel UNlTA faction. should be in a
position of control in southern Angola. In
doing this. the South Africans probably
intend to weaken Angolan Government
control - a position from which Pretoria
hopes to force Luanda to compromise on
its strong support for SWAPO. The other
purpose of the invasion was ostensibly to
maul SWAPO so much that it would be
incapable of playing an active role in
support of the Namibiane inside that
much-disputed territory.

According to South African and other
sources. Pretoria opted for a military
solution in Namibia alter intelligence
reports indicated that SWAPO would win
more than 50 per cent of the poll if an
intemationally-superVised election was
held in Nambia.

The report. coming in the aftermath of
the humiliation of South African-
aupported Bishop Abel Mumrewa at the
polls in Zimbabwe and in which Robert
Mugabe's ZANU won a landslide victory.
sent cold shivers down Pretoria's spine.

But in warning of the increase in milit’
ary activity. he said that this "is going to
involve combat situations in which. lam

Tambo was speaking at the state fun-
eral in Salisbury of ANC representative

Zimbabwe Government. The killing of
unebi was no doubt a warning to Zim-
babwe not to harbour any ANC 'temr-

The effect appears to have been the
reverse: a few days later the ANC mis-
sion in Salisbury issued its first ofﬁcial
communique from Zimbabwe. This con-
cerned an ANC rocket attack on South
Africa's vast military complex at Voor-

of none other than South Africa's Defence

The attack on the military base is only
one of many this year. The military
authorities in Pretoria admit to 31 ANC
acts against key targets in South Africa

large areas into darkness. including the
