EQUATIONS DESCRIBING THE HULTIHODB OPERATION OF AN ANNULAR LASER
[Article by s. L. Galkin. B. V. L'vov. V. H. Nikolayev]

[Text] Annular lasers are at the present time attracting the attention

of a broad clase of researchers. The overwhelming majority of published
papere on thia topic have been devoted to their single-node operation.

The calculation wae wade within the framework of the semiclaseicel method
proposed by Lamb [1]. Terms have been introduced into the equations which
take into account the backacattering similarly to how this was done in
referencea [2, 3] for the single-mode operation. The eynchronizetion of the
longitudinal nodes was calculated by the method proposed in [A] for a
laser with a Pabry-Perot resonator. The equations obtained in our paper
are not limited to the caae of purely doppler broadening ofthe line. which
extende the range of their application by comparison with the equations
for the aulti-ode annular leeera obtained in [5].

In semiclassical laser theory. the electromagnetic field is considered
cleosical, subject to the Maxwell equations, which in the open resonator
are reduced to the approximate one-dimenaional weighed equation [1. 6]

As is obvious from expressions (ll)-(llo) in the first procedure of
perturbation theory the equations for amplitudes and phases of the
oscillations in each of the two opposite waves do not depend on each other.
The interaction between the waves in this approximation is absent (with
the exception of the case of reflection of waves from nonunifornity in the

EFFECT OF AN AXIAL MAGNETIC FIELD 0N TNE TNTEIACTION OF THE COUNTER HAVES
OF AN ANNULAR NE-NE LASER HTTN SYNCNRONIZATION OF THE LONCITUDINAL MODES

[Article by 8. L. Gslkin. b. V. L'vov. V. M. Nikolayev. V. Yu. Petrun‘kin]

[Text] One of the important factors determining the practical application
of annular lasers is the stability of the beat frequency of the counter
waves. The interaction of the counter waves in the active medium leads .
to the fact that the magnitude of the beat frequency between them differs
from the frequency caused by rotation of the system or the phase-shifter.
Under the conditions of synchronization of longitudinal modes. the
competition between the counter anes leads to the fact that the beat
frequency depends essentially on the modulating frequency difference with
respect to the intermodal. the modulation depths. the displacement of the
modulator from the point of encounter of the pulses [1—3]. The enumerated
factors have a sharp effect on the stability of the frequency of the
counter waves. for they can change in the operating process. Consequently.
the attenuation of the competition of the counter waves in the active
medium increases the stability of the beat frequency.

The experimental study of the annular ﬂe-Ne laser with synchronisation of

the longitudinal modes performed by us [3] demonstrated that the axial magnetic
field applied to the active Ne-Ne medium with a natural mixture of neon
isotopes significantly decreases the effect of the position of the modulator
and the variation of the parameters of the modulating signal on the magni-

tude of the beat frequency on the counter waves. It was proposed that
this stabilizing effect of the magnetic field is connected with a decrease

in the competition of the counter waves in the active medium. that is.
that the Zeemsm splitting of the amplification circuit attenuates the
interaction of the counter waves to some degree analogously to how this
occurs in the active medium with equal content of neon isotopes.

This paper contains the results of the theoretical investigation which
confirmed the above-discussed proposition. In addition. the analysis has
demonstrated that in some range of intensities of the magnetic field the
interaction between the counter waves can even be greater than in the
absence of the field. and it depends sharply on its magnitude. The
performed experiment confirmed these results.

consider that as a result of the presence of Brewster windows in the

It must be noted that the expression for the coefficient 0 was obtained in
the purely doppler approximation 7.. y b' v ab“k"‘

The analysis of expression (1) demonstrated that in the nultimode regiae
the coefficients of the relation between the nodes of the counter waves
essentially depend on the intensity of the axial magnetic field applied to
the active sediua. It is obvious that the absolute values of a. and.
consequently. the interaction between the nodes of the oppositely directed
waves have sexina with halfwidth Yab on satisfaction of one of the
conditions

..—A.-—‘:%.+_21: ' .. (2)

for any combination of indexes u. o. o of the generated nodes.
It is obvious that the equality (2) is satisfied in two cases:

1) The magnitude of the splitting bw'ugsﬂ is such that the central
frequency of the transitions with righthand circular polarisation coincides
with the frequency of one of the nodes of the generation spectrua;

2) The nagnltude of the splitting Am is such that the central frequency
of the transitions with right circular polarisation is in the niddle of
one of the intersodal intervals.

The equality (3) has analogous leaning except that uo+ou is the central
frequency of the transitions with left circular polarisation. however,
equalities (2) and (3) cannot be satisfied if

'o-“<*M..<-o-s°~.. (4)

that is. in the case where the magnitude of the Zeeaan splitting Zen-Zungh
is greater than the spectral width of the generated nodes. 0n satisfaction
of condition (a) the modulus euoon is a monotonically decreasing function

of the asgnetic field intensity.

Thus. the results of the calculation indicate that the axial magnetic

field decreases the interaction between the counter waves of the nultinode
annular laser only in the case where the Zeenan splitting of the contour
of theapﬂication line is greater than the spectral width of the generated
node. Otherwise the interaction between the counter waves will essentially
depend on the sagnitude of the magnetic field and the spectral tuning of
the nodes, which leads to additional instability of the beat frequency of
the counter waves.

As a supplement to referencel3l. an experiment was performed permitting
estimation of the effect of the axial magnetic field on the interaction
of the counter waves of an annular He-Ne laser and to compare the experi-
mental data with the calculation results. The experimental setup was
exactly the same as in [3]. The annular He-Ne laser operated on a wave
length of 0.63 microns in the longitudinal mode synchronisation regime.
The generation occurred on 6 longitudinal modes. which corresponded to

a spectral width of Av-800 Hhertz. The modulator was placed at the
meeting point of the pulses; the modulation frequency corresponded to the
center of the mode synchronisation band. Measurements were taken of the
beat frequency of the counter waves as a function of the magnitude of the
axial magnetic field applied to the active medium. Measures were taken to
eliminate the phase anisotropy in the laser resonator by the procedure of
reference [6].

Graphs are presented in the figure for the beat frequency fb of the counter
waves as a function of the magnetic field intensity on the tubes. The
given frequency difference of the counter waves was created by a Faraday
cup, and it was 8,750 hertz. From the graph presented in Pig a it is
obvious that the beat frequency of the counter waves essentially depends
on the magnitude of the magnetic field to 250 oersteds. The variations

of the beat frequency are explicitly of a nonmonotonic resonance nature.
and they are well reproduced during repeated measurements. This is
illustrated by the graph presented in Pig b. In addition. the nature of
the function does not change with variation of the intensity of the field
applied to the active medium: the presented graphs correspond to the
opposite directions of the magnetic field on the tubes. Beginning with
the value of the magnetic field of 250 oersteds. the beat frequency of the

counter waves in practice does not depend on the magnitude of the magnetic
field.

Thus. the axial magnetic field applied to the gas discharge tubes H>250
oersteds significantly decreases the competition of the counter waves in
the annular laser with a natural mixture of neon isotopes and. as a con-
sequence, it increases the stability of the beat frequency of the counter
waves. making it less sensitive to the frequency tuning of the generated
modes with respect to the amplification line then for 8-0.

STUDY OF THE CONDITIONS OF FREQUENCY SBLP-SYNCHRDNIZATION OF THE MODES
OF A LINEAR Hl-NE LASER (1-0.63 ﬂICRONS)

[Article by V. V. Kozlov, 0. I. Kotov. B. V. L'vov. V. Yu. Petrun’kinl

[Textl It is possible to separate the operating conditions of the multi-
mode gas laser into three groups with respect to its characteristics and
its possibilities for application: 1) the free generation nodes: 2) the
conditions of complete self-synchronization of modes (css); 3) the
conditions of partial self-synchronization nodes (PSS).

The majority of the experimental and political papers are devoted to the
study of the conditions of CSS of laser modes [1. 2]. However. as the
experiments have shown, the conditions of PSS of the modes are most fre-
quently encountered. The free generation and CSS conditions are extreme
cases of the more common state of the gas laser -- the Pss [3, 6].

In this paper an experimental study was made of the conditions of PSS of
longitudinal modes of a linear Re-Ne laser (1-0.63 microns) and the effect
of an axial magnetic field on it.

An experimental device was used which was analogous to the one described
in reference [5]. Special attention was given to the investigation of the
optical spectra and the low-frequency components of the output emission.

It is known that the occurrence of the css is characterized by stabilisa-
tion of the amplitudes of the optical spectral modes [1]. Under the PSS
condition. the nature of the optical spectrum changes noticeably: the
amplitudes of certain modes fluctuate, the envelope of mode amplitudes
loses regularity of variation on making the transition from one mode to
another. For the example of Fig 1. two characteristic optical spectra
are presented.

The most characteristic attribute of the css is the appearance in the
output emission of regular low-frequency pulsations. The spectrum of the
low-frequency pulsations was investigated using a low-frequency spectral
snalyzer. Several spectral components with sultiple frequencies have been
observed (Fig 2).

The low-frequency pulsation frequency depends in complex fashion on the
tuning of the mode spectrum with respect to the center of the atomic line.
The experiments were performed with a natural mixture of neon isotopes and
with equal-isotopic composition. In the second case. the frequency and

amplitude of the low-frequency pulsations vary insignificantly on frequency
tuning of the mode spectrum.

In addition, the frequency of the low—frequency pulsations depends on the
magnitude of the relative excitation (the amount that the amplification
exceeds the losses): the increase in relative excitation leads to a
decrease in pulsation frequency.

The experiments in which the active medium of the gas laser was placed in

an axial magnetic field are the most important for revealing the mechanism
of 988. It was discovered that the frequency of the low-frequency pulsa-
tions essentially depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field (see Pig 3).
In the presented relation two important characteristics are isolated:

l) with an increase in the magnetic field. a general trend toward a decrease
in the frequency of the low-frequency pulsations appears; 2) in the
resonance values of the magnetic field H-H 2H0 , 380 .... where the splitting
of the o-eomoonents of the amplification 12mo is equal to or a multiple of
the intermode interval. the monotonic decrease of the curve is disturbed,

and transition to other operating conditions of the laser are possible [5].

According to the results of reference [a]. the complete self-synchronisation
node occurs on satisfaction of the inequality 02th #32. where 0 describes
the frequency pulling and exclusion effects. and A and a are the phase-

dependent effects of cross saturation of the nodes and the coshination
tones e

The opposite inequality. on the basis of the great nonlinearity of the
dispersion curve (oIO) or the insufficient nagnituda of the amplitudes

of the conbination tones leads to the appearance of a non-zero difference

in magnitudes of the different interuodal intervals. and it causes estab-
lishment of the partial self-synchronization. The differences in magnitudes
of the intermodal intervals determine the frequency of the lowefrequency
pulsations. In turn. the magnitudes of the intermodal interval depend on
the pulling and exclusion effects of the modes influencing the dispersion
curve of the actiVe material.

The tuning of the node spectrum with respect to the center of the atomic
line of neon. the variation in magnitude of the relative excitation cause
variation of the mode exclusion effects and. consequently. the curvature
of the dispersion curve [3]. Thus. an increase in relative excitation.
as a rule. improves the linearity of the dispersion curve. which leads to
a decrease in frequency of the low-frequency pulsations.

The experiments with respect to investigating the optical spectrum of the
gas laser with windows at the Brewster angle. the active medium of which
is placed in an axial magnetic field demonstrated that with an increase
in the magnetic field. the apex of the amplification line will become
flatter and. consequently. the dispersion curve will become more linear.
Under 955 conditions. this. of course. leads to a reduction in the fre-
quency of the low-frequency pulsations with an increase in the magnetic
field. In the resonance values of the magnetic field [5] as a result of
the nonlinear relation of the o-conponents leading to intensification of
the relation between axial modes. the mode exclusion effects vary intensely.
The latter fact is also one of the causes of the appearance of resonance
self-synchronization [S] and also disturbance of the monotonicity of the
frequency variation of the low-frequency pulsations (Pig 3).

The phenomena of partial self-synchronization are observed clearly and
stahly in a large range of variation of the laser parameters in the case
of relatively short lasers (the resonator length is less than 70 cm).

in the lasers with long optical resonators. the partial self-synchroniza-
tion "halts" the complete self-synchronization zone [5]. As a rule. the
transitions from the free generation mode to the canplete self-synchronisa-
tion or the inverse occur through the conditions of partial self-
synchronization of the nodes.

STABILIZATION O? TRB RADIATION FREQUENCY OF AN ANNULAR HB-NE LASER

[Article by V. N. Arsumanov. G. P. Zaytaevl

[Text] In the modern radiation frequency stabilisation systems of gas
lasara broad use has been made of the methods connected with using the
power resonances both in the generator itself and in various types of
external absorbing cells. The majority of the developed stabilisation
procedures can also be used in annular laeaers. but along with them the
narrow radiation power peaks in them can be obtained as a result of the
effect of competition of counter waves at the center of the amplification
line of the active medium [1]. The basic results of investigating the
possibility of stabilisation of the radiation frequency of an annular
laser using the effect of the interaction of counter waves are presented
in this report.

In the first phase of this work a study is made of the conditions of
obtaining the power peaks of the output radiation in an annular laser on
a wavelength of 0.6328 microns. The two gas discharge sgbes a. S of the
ORG-16 type laser with a natural mixture of ".20 and Ne isotopes placed
in solenoids. the mirrors 1-3 and the phase plate 6 form an anisotropic
3-mirror resonator with a 75 cm perimeter.

As is known [2]. the anomalous dispersion of the active mediu- in the
presence of an axial magnetic field leads to nonmutual Faraday rotation

of the polarisation plane of two counter running waves. The phase plate
placed in the resonator is arranged at an angle which compensates the
rotation of the polarization plane of one of the waves and increases it

for the other. The presence in the laser resonator of Brewster windows
lands to amplitude anisotropy as a result of the loss difference between
the two counter waves and suppression of one of them (for the corresponding
increase in radiation power of the other) at the center of the amplification
line of the active medium where the competition phenomenon is expressed
moat sharply. here. narrow peaks (see Pig 2a) appear in the shape of the
output radiation curve of each of the waves. the width of which is
determined by the resonator parameters and the active medium. and it can

be regulated by variation of the magnetic field created by the solenoids.
For weak fields (in the described experiment less than 50 oerateds). the
widths of the peaks diminiehed with an increase in the field. and it

reached a value of 10 to 20 aegahertz with respect to the halfheight free

the aaxinua level. Further constriction of the power peska was noted by

the distortions caused by the appearance of peaks between the waves, for

high intensities of the magnetic field. This phone-anon is connected with

the phase anisotropy o! the resonator caused by the Faraday effect in the
active aediun. however. for veak fielda as e reault of scattering of the
light on the optical surfecea and dust particles. the frequencies of the
counter waves are mutually synchronized. With an increaae in the synchroniza-
tion field intensity. each of the waves generates on a frequency deter-inad

by the optical length of the resonator for this wave.

The threahold value of the field causing loos of eynchroniaation is the
detuning function and has a nexiaua at the center of the aaplificetion

line of the active aediun.

In itself. the absence of synchronisation of the counter waves must not
have a significant effect on the shape of the peak. but as a result of
the nentioned dispersion of the light. in addition to the basic waves.
part of the reflected second wave is incident on the photodetector. The
beats between the waves occurring here can significantly distort the shape
of the output radiation curve (Pig 2. b). Let us note that even for a
field which is close to threshold. undesirable deforsation of the shape
of the peak is observed. Accordingly. magnitude of the Iagnstic field
intensity for the existence of the frequency stabilisation was selected
within the limits of do to so oersteds. here a peak width of less than
10 negaherts could not be obtained in the perforned experiaent.

The experinental setup of the frequency stabilisation systen of the
annular laser is presented in Pig 3. In order to lower the losses and
the nusber of scattering surfaces. the phase plate was not installed in
the resonator. Its role was played by the Brewster window of the gas-
discharga tubes in which twin bean refraction is observed caused by
residual stresses in the glass [3]. Even weak rotation of one of the
tubes around the longitudinal axis causes high anplitudinal anisotropy
in the resonator. The conditions of obtaining power peaks and their

shape did not differ significantly in this case fros those investigated
above.

In order to realise stabilisation. the output enission of the laser was
frequency nodulated and sent to the photoreceiver of the autonatic fre-
quency control systas. The latter contains two autosatic control loops.
the first with ssall tine constants is designed for conpsnsation for
cooperatively fast frequency fluctuations. and the second. for selecting
slow drifts. The circuitry of the second loop includes an integrator
which is executed on the basis of the KlUTAOll integrated circuit. The
tuning was realised with respect to the naxinun of the radiation output
power peak. The long-tern frequencygstability obtained in the anperinents
(in 60 ninutas) was no worse than 10 in this case.

LASER ON THE 3.39 MICRON LINE

[Article by Ye. Yu. Andreyeve. Yo. N. Zhnin'ko. D. K. Terekhin.

[Text] Increasing the pressure of the gas mixture can significantly
affect the polarization and frequency characteristics of the laser in a
magnetic field [1-40].

In this paper a report is given on the results of the experimenta to study
the effect of pressure on the. relation between the polarization modes of
the laser in a wide range of magnetic fields. The choice of the transition
with a wavelength of l-3.39 microns is explained by the fact that the
pressure has a significant effect on the nature of the broadening. Accord-
ing to [5]. the uniform line width y b-ZS megaherts+30'p megahertz/tort

'l'he single-frequency laser was a discharge tube 3 am in diameter and 210 I:
long sealed by windows perpendicular to the axis and placed in a solenoid.
and the resonator of the plane-sphere type with spacing between the axial
modes of 500 megahertz. The transverse modes were selected by the diaphragm.
The length of the resonator was varied using pistocaramics fastened to the
flange of a spherical mirror.. The emission with 0* or o' polarization was
isolated using the ll‘ plate and polarieer. The application of the 81-29
storing oscillograph made it possible with continuous frequency scanning
of the resonator simultaneously to obtain oscillograms of the intensities
of u" and o‘ polarization modes . I- and to observe their variation as

a function of the resonator detun ng and magnitude of the magnetic field.
in order to exclude the affect of the isotopic composition of the mixture
on the :shape of the amplification line, the “.20 isotope was used for the
measurements.

However. from [7. 8] it is known that even for a weak relation between the

Here the coefficients a and 0 characterize the saturation of each mode by

Here the value of a/B determines the intensity of the single-frequency
generation. For the A-3.39 microns line where the Lamb trough is weakly
expressed even for low pressures (see Fig l). the approximation B‘l is
admissible. The intensity I was determined from the oscillograms. and
the unsaturated amplification a on a frequency of v-vo was calculated
for the doppler curve as a function of its shift equal to gun (3-1.1).

The data obtained on the functions C(H) make it possible to draw the
conclusion that increasing the pressure leads to an increase in the
coupling coefficient. but the coupling on the 3.39 micron line remains
weak. For comparison of the experimental values of c with the theoretical
values. a calculation was made of C(H) by the formulas presented in [7]

calculated and experimental values of c are as follows:

ccalc 0.00 0.063 0.059 0.055 0.052

Free the presented data it is obvious that the calculated values of the
magnitudes of the coupling compare well with the experimental values.

This serves as confirmation of the fact that the proposed procedure can

be used to determine the asgnitude of the coupling coefficient in any case
in the investigated magnetic field range. A quantitative comparison of
theory with experiment was made only for low pressure inasmuch as the theory
of [7] was created in the approximation of strong doppler broadening of the

amplification line (v.g<<ku). and for the line 1-3.39 nicrone. the increase
in pressure disturbs this condition [3. S].

The investigation of the relation between the polarization mode of the

laser includes not only the problem of the interaction of split modes of

the resonator. but also the problem of the interaction of the axial modes
generating on the well-separated Zeeman components of the amplification line.
when the Zeeman splitting bug is a multiple of the distance between the
modes a. according to the theory [7). the relation between modes increases.
and in the relation for the total intensity as a function of the magnetic
field I; (H) troughs must appear. The ratios of the maximum intensities

of the nodes 11/! on variation of the magnetic field are presented in

Pig 2. For Av3~llga and 6V3~d. when H is on the order of 170 and 360 oersteds.
respectively. the value of llltz decreases significantly. The depth of

the troughs increases with an increase in pressure. which indicates an
increase in the coupling between the modes in these regions. A decrease

in 1)]! is also accompanied by troughs in the functions I; (a). The

small difference in intensities I and 12 observed for all pressures in

the entire range of magnetic field is obviously connected with the non-
isotropicity of the pumping on the Zeeman aublevels or with the difference

in circular anisotropy of the resonator [1].

Thus. from the presented experimental results it is obvious that increas-
ing the pressure has qualitatively the same effect on the interaction of
. the o-modes of the laser both in small and in large magnetic fields.

STABILIZATION OF THE FREQUENCY SPBCTRUH OP A CONTINUOUS Ar+ LASER
BY A LONOITUDINAL MAGNETIC FIELD

[Article by A. E. Potiadil

[Text] It ie well known [1-6] that the frequency epectrun of the radiation
of en Ar’ laeer hae a nuaber of epecific neculieritiee connected with the
great width of the radiation line of the argon iona. laeically theee

neculiaritiee reduce to the following.

1. For the average excitation levele. the epectrua of the Ar+ laaar ie
etable and ia characterized by an increaee in the interval between the

general frequenciea which aaounta to aeveral frequency intervele of the
reeonator c/ZL.

2. The epectrun of the ion leaer ie extrenely unatable for the excitation
level exceeding eone phyeical value. Generation occura randoaly on ell
of the reeonance frequenciea of the reeonator.

)- As a rule. the axial magnetic field ehifte the upper bound of the
region of etable generation in the direction of larger excitation levele.
The broadening of the etable generation range on application of the
longitudinal magnetic field wee connected th with broadening of the
uniforn line [6. 7] end with general broad-.lng of the contour of the
radiation line [7].

In thie paper a etudy wee made of the spectrum of the longitudinal typee
of oecillatione of the continuoua Ar+ laaer (x-aaao A) ae a function of
the diecharge current and the inteneity of the longitudinal magnetic field.
In thie paper a atudy wee nade of the frequency epectru- of laeere of two

laser emission with internal mirrors and with Brewster windows. The
series of oscillogrnmm of the radiation spectrum of the laser with internal
mirrors is presented in Fig l for various values of the magnetic field
intensity. As is obvious from this figure. the spectrum remains invariant
to fields of approximately 130 oersteds (see Fig l. b).

with an increase in the magnetic field intensity. the spectrum varies
discontinuously (Pig 1. c): the frequency distance between the two
generating modes is 680 megahertz (Tc/2L). here the frequency distance
between the centers of the Zeeman o-contours is 560 megahertr. A further
increase in the field led to an increase proportionally to the magnetic
field of the distance between the generating modes (Fig l. d). The analysis
of the radiation polarisation using the Ali plate demonstrated that each
mode corresponds to its Zeaman o-conponent. It must be noted that when
obtaining these oscillogrsms. the intensity of the emission was maintained
approximately on the same level (using the discharge current). This was a
forced measure inasmuch as for s magnetic.field intensity of more than

160 oersteds. a sharp increase in intensity of the laser emission with the
field started. which led to instability of the frequency spectrum. The
maximum intensity for which a stable radiation spectrum was maintained

for the laser with internal mirrors. in the absence of the magnetic field

exceeded the critical intensity in the absence of the field by a total of
15:.

Another picture was observed in a laser with Brewster windowa. Fig 2 shows
a series of oscillograms obtained for this type of laser for various values
of the magnetic field intensity. is is obvious from the figure. the
radiation spectrum of the laser did not change to a field with an intensity
of 360 oorsteds (Pig 2. a. b). For a field intensity of 360 oersteds

two stable modes appeared in the spectrum. The intensity of the laser
radiation increased in this case by 6 times. These two modes were retained
in the generation on variation of the field to 600 oersteds. The spacing
between them did not change. it remained constant. and the radiation
increased by 1.5 times (Fig 2. d). for a field intensity of 600 oersteds.
a spectrum discontinuously transfers to multimode. nonateble. although it
has two characteristic frequencies (Pig 2. e). Pinally. for a field
intensity of 800 oersteds the spectrum becomes stable. and the generation
occurs on the individual o-componenta. with a further increase in the
field. the spacing between these modes increases proportionally to the
field (Fig 2. f).

Thus. it is possible to draw the conclusion that basically it is not simply
the superposition of the longitudinal magnetic field in itself that leads
to increased stabilization of the radiation spectrum of the Ar+ laser. but
the presence of a window at the Brewster angle in the laser resonator.
Apparently. the presence of a window at the Brewster angle in the laser
resonator intensifies the competition of the longitudinal types of
oscillations. Actually. the losses introduced by the Brewster window are
different for circular Zeeman components and the overlap zone of them
inasmuch as the radiation polarization in the overlap zone of the contours

37
P08 0P?ICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICfAL 088 ONLY

is linear. The growth of the population inversion in the magnetic field
leads to an increase in the overlap tone. and the modes located in it have
lower losses than the nodes outside this cone. inasmuch as the overlap
tone of the n-contuuru is more constricted than the entire amplification
circuit. the competition occurs between a smaller number of modes. and
therefore generation is possible on one or two stable frequencies. 0n
achievement of this inversion when the amplification on each circular
o-component is greater than the losses determined by the Brewster window.
the spectrum becomes unstable (the generation Jumps from individual
o-cosponents to their'overlap tone and back). Finally. for a field
intensity where the amount that the amplification exceeds the losses in
the overlap tone is less than the amount that the amplification in each
circular o-loop exceeds the losses in the brewster resonator. generation
again becomes stable. and each mode generates on its own o-circuit. With
an increase in the pumping power so much that the amplification coefficient
on each individual o-component is so large that generation is possible on
eeverel modes in each circular component. generation again will be
characterized by a nonstable spectrum for all values of a. This was
actually observed in the experiment. Thus. in the present paper it was
discovered that through a stabilization of the spectrum of the Ar* laser
in a longitudinal magnetic field is caused not by magnetic field itself,
but it is connected with the presence in the resonator of a window at the
Brewster angle.

[Test] The NszAc lasers are sole of the nest prospective solid state
quantus lasers for various applications (1]. The basic probles on the
path of broad utilisation of such lasers is obtaining the single-frequency
operating node. In cooperatively few publications on this subject. an
inclined Pabry-Perot interferes-tor was used as the longitudinal node
selectors [2. 3]. The authors of [2. 3] noted that on realisation of the
single-node regiae in a broad pulping range the Q-factor of the inclined
interferometer lust be quite high. however. the losses introduced into the
resonator by the inclined interfere-star increase sharply in this case.
the require-ant on the precision of the nenufecture. its installation in
the resonator. and so on are higher. The deficiencies of the inclined
interfere-star as a selector of longitudinal nodes nust also be considered
to include the difficulty of tuning the frequency corresponding to the
aaxinue transniosion factor. the resonator node frequency during operation
in the laser frequency stabilisation regine with respect to an external
standard.

The eulti-irror systeas of selectors developed and successfully used in
gas lasers are to a significant degree free of these deficiencies.

The operating principle of such devices consists in the fact that one of
.the resonator nirrors is replaced by a conplex eultinirror reflector having
a sharp dependence of the reflection coefficient on the frequency. For
selection of longitudinal nodes in the Nd:YAn laser in the given paper
perhaps the east successful systen proposed in reference [‘1 use used.

The schenstic of the experieentel device is illustrated in the figure.
The laser resonator is forned by the eirrors l-e. The Nd:YA6 crystal

3 an in diasoter by ‘5 II was used as the active medium. A transparent
coating was applied to the ends of the crystal. and one of the ends was
beveled at an angle of 1.5‘. The pulping was realized by e high-pressure
nxsrv-Isoo krypton lanp. The diaphrsgn D 1.7 In in dieneter was placed

in order to decrease the losses introduced by the complex reflector. the
second surface of the dividing mirror was transiilumineted. The length of
the active resonator was equal to tl+t2-80 em. and the length of the passive
resonator. iz+i3-8 cm.

inasmuch as the amplification line width of the NdeAG leesr was about

150 gigaherts. the generation could occur on several frequencies correspond-
ing to the peaks of the reflection coefficient of the multimirror selector.
in order to obtain generation on one longitudinal mode. an auxiliary
selector 8 was placed in the resonator which is in the form of an inclined
Pabry-Perot interferometer. in connection with the fact that the peaks of
the reflection coefficient of the complex reflector are quite sharply
separated with respect to frequency (c/2(12+t ):2-10 hertz). the 0-factor
of the auxiliary selector can be made low. T is leads to a minimum in the
losses introduced by them into the resonator. and it insures esse end
noncriticalness of its tuning.

The interferometer used in this experiment c was a plane-parallel quart:
plate 2 mm thick with interference coatings applied to its surface. The
reflection coefficient of the coatings was on the order of 23:.

The selection mode was maintained using the electronic automatic frequency
control system. For this purpose. the modulating voltage of S kiloherts
frequency was fed from the sound generator (26) to one of the sides of the
two-section piesoelectric converter (PEP). The signal generator using

the photodiode (fbl). went from the amplifier (0) and then to the
synchronous detector (so). The error signal from the output of the
synchronous detector was amplified in the Dc amplifier and fed to the
second section of the PEP for tuning the peak of the reflection coefficient
of the selecting reflector to the generation frequency. In order to elim-
inate the residual error. the integrator (I) of the error signal was
introduced into the automatic frequency control system. the output of which
was connected to the first section of the Far.

The described system made it possible to realise long-term stable single-
frequency generation. exceeding the pumping threshold by more than 30!.

The maximum obtained radiation power in the single-frequency mode was

300 milliwetts. The spectrum of the longitudinal modes was controlled
using the Pabry-Parot scanning interferometer (8!) with a base of 100 mm
and mirror reflection coefficients of about 992. the radiation to which was
fed through the optical decoupling (OR). The transverse distribution was
recorded on the screen of an image converter. 0n disconnection of the
automatic frequency control system. the time of existence of the single-
frequency generation mode did nor exceed 15 minutes. and it jusps from mode
to mode or generation on several modes directly were observed. The power

An experimental check of the investigated system makes it possible to

PULSE POLARIMBTER FOR LASER RESEARCR
[Article by N. H. Koehevnikov. s. V. Kruehalov. L. N. Pakhomov]

[Text] At the present time the nest complete study has been made of the
polarization characteristics of the quantun generator with the form of

the polarization and intensity of the emission (for example. of gas lasers).
slowly varying in time. (or the polarization analysis in this case is based
on the well-known methods. The polarization properties of the emission of
the pulsed solid-state lasers have been less investigated due to the fact
that the pulse polariaeters required for this purpose have essentially
greater complexity. The latter is connected with the necessity for
determining with high time resolution both the ellipticity and the asiluth
of the completely polarised part of the emission and the degree of polarise-
tion of the emission. the intensity of which is of a clearly expressed
nonstesdy state nature.

At the same time. the study of the polarisation properties of the emission
of solid state lasers is becoming more and more urgent. for an entire
series of problems connected with the broad introduction of these devices
in science and engineering will require the use of polarisation-anisotropic
elements in the composition of the laser. It is also known that the
anisotrOpy of some of the resonator elements. in particular. the active
body of the laser. essentially depends on the operating conditions of the
generator. and the polarisation properties of the emission obviously are
interconnected with the remaining output characteristics of the laser.
Thus. the complex study of the polarisation of the laser emission is
required which would make it possible to solve the problem of its relation
to the other radiation characteristics and to the operating conditions of
the generator which. in turn. would promote more successful operation in
the area of improving the output characteristics of the quantum devices.

Operating Principle of the indeed Polarimeter

As hen already been noted above. the polarization analysis of the pulse
characteristics of a laser is connected with the determination of the
basic polarization characteristics of the emission in a time less than the
tine of significant variation of the radiation intensity. For the solution
of this problem it is necessary with the corresponding time resolution to
measure four independent variables, for example. the Stokes parameters

The determination of Ihu Siukvn pnrnmeteru directly connected with the
method of exporisuntal location of them consists in the following ll].

Let us consider four filters. each of which transmits the intensity of

the unpolerieed light. The first filter is isotropic. The second filter
is a complete polariser with horizontal transmission axis. and the third
is a complete polariser with the transmission axis rotated by 65° with
respect to the second. and the fourth conpletely transmits only the right-
circular polarised light. If the investigated light beam is split into
four parts and is fed to these four filters. than after the filters the
intensities will he V1. V2. 93. V‘. The desired Stokes parameters are

defined in terms of these values in the following way:

polarisation on reflection (transmission) of light from the mirror was
achieved by the setup of them such that the light would be successively
reflected (with pass) from the mirrors. the planes of incidence on which
were orthogonal. A large number of mirrors required for this purpose
complicated the structural design of the instrument and made it inconvenient
for operation.

Reference [3) contains s report on the structural design of the pulsed
polsrimeters differing advantageously from that investigated in [2) by
combination of the light divider and polariser functions in one element --
the Brewster plate. The instrument manufactured by us. the description of
which is presented below. is analogous to that proposed in reference [3].

Structural Design of the Pulse Polarimeter

The optical system of the polsrimster is presented in Fig l. a. The
device is made up of three pairs of Brewster plates. The planes of
incidence of the light on the plates in each pair are orthogonal. which
permits us to have emission after each pair with the initial form and
degree of polarisation. The plane of incidence of the light on the first
plate of the second pair is rotated by as‘ with respect to the plane of
incidence of the light on the first plate of the first pair. Before the
third pair of plates there is a linear quarter-wave phase plate. the axis
of the highest velocity of which is rotated with respect to the plane of
incidence of the light on the first plate of the third pair by 65’. This
mutual position of the elements of the device will permit performance of
four independent measurements of the intensities which are directly related
to the parameters of the Stokes electromagnetic radiation. in order to
eliminate the effect of the selective properties of the Brewster plates on
the readings of the device. the plates are made with a wedge angle of -lO'.
The quarter-wave plate was a plane—parallel substrate made of [-8 glass
and a plate made of crystal quartz in optical contact with it. the optical
axis of which was located in the plane of the input face. The thickness
of the quartz plate was 30.1 u. which corresponds to the phaseleod

of l/A between the orthogonal components of the electric field (l-l.06u).

The light reflection from the Brewster plates was incident on the inter-
ference filters (l-l.06u. 61-200 A), and then it was focused by the

lenses (f.20 mm) on the FD-7K photodiodee which were used as radiation
receivers. The pass band of the photodiodee was sufficient f3; resolution
of the individual peaks of free generation of the laser on Nd glass.

The signals from the photodiodee were incident on the inputs of the five-
beam 81-33 oscillogrnph.

The instrument was tuned with respect to the gas laser beam and after
smtual orientation of the Brewster and quarter-wave plates it was reduced
to matching of the gas laser beam with the axis of the device (using the
dinphragms installed at the input and output of the device with small
aperture). The calibration required for operation with the pblsriaeter
was realized using a neodymium laser. in the resonator of which a complete
polariaer was placed (a stack of 18 Brewster plates). The calibration

polarization characteristics of the emission varied randonly from peak to

to the Brewster angle ((-57'. p-0.52). the emission was found to be almost

These results are easy to understand if we consider that in a resonator
with amplitude anisotropy two orthogonal linear polarizations oriented
with respect to the natural axes of transmission of the partial polarizer
are self-reproducing. Inasmuch as the losses for the natural polarization
are different. the polarization. the azimuth of which coincides with the
axis of greatest transmission of the partial polarizer has an advantage.
However. under defined conditions (low magnitude of the anisotropy. high
pumping level). considering the weakness of the mechanisms of energy
exchange with respect to polarization. the generation conditions can be
executed also for emission with polarization having greater losses. This
problem was investigated theoretically in reference [5]. with the outputs
of which our results agree well.

In the case of successive inclusion of the pumping tubes in the obtained
experimental relations two regions were clearly observed. A region
p>~0.9b (the angle of inclination of the plates (<20') was characterized
by high dispersion in the values of the degree of polarization (from 0 to
1001). ellipticity (from O to l) and polarization azimuth (0'-360') from
peak to peak. In the region p>~0.96. noticeable ordering of the polariza-
tion characteristics of the emission occurred. The magnitude of the
ellipticity and the dispersion of the values in it decreased sharply. and
the form of the polarization approached linear. 0n variation of the
parameter p from 0.9‘ to 0.62. the polarisation azimuth varied smoothly
from ~81 to ~88°. approaching the direction coinciding with the axis of

In order to explain the results obtained. let us use the conclusions of
reference [6]. where by using the Jones method a study was lads of the
natural states of polarization of the analogous resonator. A characteristic
feature of the investigated systes is the existence of the liniting angle

In the region |e|:>¢he(P) two elliptical polarizations are reproduced
with identical losses which do not depend on 0. identical azinuths and
ellipticitiea. but different with respect to direction of rotation of the

This behavior of the polarization characteristics of the resonator sakes

the presence of two regions in the experi-ental functions understandable.
Actually. inasnuch as for large values of the pereaeter p two ellipses

with identical losses and opposite directions of rotation of the field
vector are reproduced. it is entirely natural (considering the fluctuation
processes in real lasers) that the output eaisaion is found to be non-
polarized during the free generation pulse. Beginning with the tine when
p20.96 is satisfied. the eniseion becomes polarised to a significant degree.
for out of the two natural linear polarizations of the resonator possible
in this case. the generation conditions are satisfied (for snail excesses

of the pumping over the threshold realized in our experiments) only for

one having swaller losses. The eolparison of the experilental and calculated
behavior of the e-ission polarization azimuth as a function of the sapli-
tude anisotropy paraneter permits highly precise deter-instion of the angle
of rotation of the direction of polarization in the active body which turned
out to be equal to ~l.5°. This value of the angle agrees well with the
value obtained in referents [a].

The results of this paper demonstrated the prospectiveness of using the
created polarineter to study the characteristics of the pulse lasers.

The possibilities of the optical signal processing system with ultrasonic

large nueber of channels it is necessary to deter-inc the maxi-us possible
density of the srrengeaent of the channels, for the total sire of its use-
ful aperture is limited by the optical systel. This is connected with the
fact that for large apertures the optical systea itself begins to introduce
phase distortions which essentially worsens the characteristics of the
processing systee. The density of the arrange-ant of the ultrasonic
channels in the aodulator can be increased by several procedures.

1. As wee proposed in reference [l2]. use a eultichsnnel sound guide eye-

modulators raising the operating frequency is limited by the large amount
of attenuation of the ultrasound.

3. Increase the density of the arrangement of the channels by using a
multichannel modulator in which the ultrasonic nodes overlap.

The modulators with overlapping nodes can be used for optical processing
of the antenna array signals. The investigation of the operation of the
modulator indicates that on variation of the angle of incidence of the
radial wave on the antenna array. the maximum distribution of the light
field will be shifted in the focal plane around the circle with radius
h-zr/A with its center on the optical axis of the system [13]. The signals
with different frequencies F will correspond to circles with radii
ki-Zs/d‘. that is. the radial distribution of the light intensity will
correspond to the power spectrum of the input signal. with this processing
procedure. the maximum density of the arrangement of the channels will be
limited by the admissible magnitude of the electroacoustic interaction
between the electrodes of the pieeeconverter.

It is possible to show [13] that on satisfaction of the condition

Experimental Study of Nultichannel Ultrasonic Light Modulators

The development of the structural design and the process for the manufacture
of multichannel liquid modulators was initially carried out on models of
8-channel modulators. On the basis of the results of these studies. models
of multichannel modulators (60 to 50 channels) were built with a sound

guide system and with overlapping channels operating in the Raman-Nutt and

Bragg diffraction nodes. As the electroacoustic converters. the TsTS-23
pieeocernmic plates were used.

The first of the investigated models had 8 channels. The modulator was
made up of a holder for the pietoconverters. couvattes made up of fused
quartz filled with distilled water and methyl holders for the couvette.
Eight palladium electrodes were applied to the converter plate 18x10 mm in
site and 110 microns thick (rcutzzo megahertz) on one side. and it was
completely metal plated on the other side. The electrodes were arranged
with a repetition period of 1-1.5 mm, and their dimensions were "-0.75 mm
and ﬂ-smm. The holder of the piezoconvarter was designed in such a way
that in the operating position the plate of the converter was completely
submerged in water. The ultrasonic waves emitted from one side of the
pieaoconverter were absorbed by a rubber insert fastened to the holder.

0n the other side of the converter the waves were emitted into the
operating aperture of the modulator and they were used for modulation of
the light beam. On the bottom of the couvetts there was an absorbing
rubber insert which insured the traveling wave regime. The multichannel
sound guide system was made up of a number of opaque glass partitions

0.3 mm thick attached with the same repetition period in a special frame
which was inserted in the couvette. When necessary the modulator could
be used without the sound guide system. The couvetts was rigidly fastened
in the metal frame in which provision was made for the possibility of
adjusting the converter with respect to the sound guide system.

The modulators were investigated in an optical device made up of OSK-Z
elements with focal length of the integrating lense of 1600 mm.

The frequency characteristics of the modulator were measured by the light
intensity in the diffraction spectrum of the 1st order. As the measurements
demonstrated. the resonance frequencies of the modulator channels differed

insignificantly. and the operating frequency band with respect to the

3 decibel level was about 101. The required values of the modulation
index o-0.3 was reached for an amplitude of the input signal of 0.5 volts.
The magnitude of the acoustic interaction between adjacent channels was
estimated in the following way: one of the modulator channels was excited,
and the intensity of the diffracted light was measured. It turned out that
this intensity caused by penetration of the ultrasound from the adjacent
channel was 20 decibels less than the intensity of the light diffracted on
the ultrasonic waves of the excited channel. For parallel excitation of
the modulator channel, the dispersion in the intensity of the ultrasound
in the channel did not exceed 1 decibel.

The distribution of the light intensity in the diffraction spectrum of the
lst order with cophasal excitation of the modulator channels was measured.
As the photometric measurements demonstrated, this distribution basically
corresponds to expression (2). 0n excitation of the channels by signals
with linear phase ' lead from channel to channel by 390' the shift of
the principal peak of the light intensity in the diffraction spectrum of
the 1st order corresponds to the calculated value of gees microns.

A study is made of the possibility of decreasing the level of the side lobes

for which amplitude weighting of the signals exciting the modulator by
the following law was introduced:

V-=V-f++%cos=(."r-+)l-

With this distribution. the signal amplitude of the edge channels of the
modulator drops to V I3. As the measurements demonstrated, the side lobe

level in this case w s 19 decibels, and the width of the main peak
increased by approximately 1.6 times.

The structural design of the model of the Debye-Seara multichannel liquid
light modulator (‘60 channels) with the sound guide system is analogous

to the one investigated above. The site of the operating aperture of this
modulator was 60x50 mm. The distribution of the ultrasound intensity in

the modulator channels is presented in Pig 2. The remaining characteristics
of the modulator are the same as in the preceding case. The multichannel
(=50 channels) light modulator with overlapping channels operated in the
Bragg fraction regime on a frequency of 27 megahertz. The spacing between
the electrodes of the converter in this case was 1 mm.

in Fig 3 we see the light intensity distribution in the diffraction spectrum
at the lat order for cophasal excitation of all the channels by signals of
equal amplitude. The width of the principal peak of this distribution

uith respect to the halfpower level will be =20 microns. 0n excitation of
the modulator channels by signals of equal amplitude but with linear phase
leads from channel to channel by 1135'. the displacement of the principal
peak corresponded to the calculated value and was 3375 microns. Incidentally.
this modulator can be used in the system for optical processing of the
antenna array signals.

The performed studies indicate the possibility of creating sufficiently
complex multichannel ultrasonic light modulators suitable as the information
input devices to the optical signal processing systems for various purposes.

SOLID STATE ULTRASONIC LIGHT HODULATORS HIT“ LION? GUIDES MADE OF HEAVY
PLINTS

[Article by Ye. T. Aksenov. N. A. Yesepkina. V. A. ﬂarkov.
V. P. Pikarnikov. S. V. Pruss-Zhuhovskiy]

[Text] Ultrasonic light nodulators are being successfully used in the
systens for optical data processing for input and analysis of signals.
In these modulators the sound guides can be liquids (to frequencies of
~30 negehertz). optically transparent solid states - crystals (e- H103.
PhMoO‘. LiNhoa. u - Sioz) and also certain varieties of glass).

In a number of cases (vibration. large temperature gradient. and so on)

the application of the liquids can turn out to be conplicated. On the
other hand the crystals which could be used in this case are at the
present tine cooperatively expensive and have certain technological
deficiencies. Therefore. the special glass, the acouatooptical quality

of which is relatively high is of definite interest for the nanufacture

of the sound guides for ultrasonic modulators. The data on measuring the
ecoutoopticai parameters of glass of the heavy flint type [1] indicate that
for comparatively slell damping of the ultrasound (from 0.1 to 2 decibels/cu
on a frequency of ‘40 negahertz) the coefficient of their scoustoopticsl
quality Nz-n‘pzlos3 is 5-6 times greater than fused quarts. In the
presented formula n is the index of refraction of the material; p is the
photoolastic constant; 0 is the density of the naterial; s is the speed of
the ultrasonic oscillations. Pros the point of view of acoustooptical
qualities and also considering that optically uniforn samples of large
size can be nsde fro. the glass, the heavy flints are highly prospective for
the eonufacture of sound guides of ultrasonic light nodulators in the
frequency band to 100 megahertz.

According to the process described in [2]. several single-channel and sultio
channel models of modulators node of flints of the TF—lo. T?-3. TP-l types
in the frequency band of 20 to 60 negaherts were manufactured and investi-
gated. ﬂelf-vave plates of rats-23 ceramic and LiNbOi Y+36' out were used

as the piesoconverter. In order to obtain the travel ng ultrasonic wave

regine. the end of the nodulator opposite the piezoconverter was beveled
at an angle of ~lO'.

0n the hasis of the single-channel ultrasonic modulator operating in the
anan-Nutt diffraction node at a frequency of 36 megahertz, a model of

an acoustooptical spectral analyser was developed. the schematic of which
is presented in Fig 1. Its band with respect to leVel of relative intensity
equal to 0.3 was 26 megaherts. The sound guide of the modulator

zoxzsxas ma was made of 19-: glass. The halfvave plate of Lith Y+36‘
cut was used as the piesoconverter. The dimensions of the operat ng
electrodes eteraining the region of interaction of the light with sound
are 3x10 ma . for the input signal v(t)-a coslﬂt+d(t)l the amplitude and
intensity distribution of the light diffracted on the ultrasonic wave in
the lat order spectrum in the output focal plane of the acoustoopticel
spectral analyser is defined by the expressions [3. i):

index of the light Have: An is the variation of the index of refraction
of the median of the sound guide under the effect of an elastic vave; e(t)
is the initial phase of the signal fed to the piezoconverter. From the
presented expressions it follows that the distribution of the light
intensity in the output focal plane represents the energy spectrum of the
signal hitting the pieaoconverter of the ultrasonic modulator and also
that the position of the diffraction peak depends on the frequency of the
input signal. and is defined by ratio u-l/A. For small angles of

diffraction. the direction of the let-order diffraction peak is defined by
the expression

A characteristic feature of the acoustooptical spectral analyzer is the
fact that the amplitudes and frequencies of the entire analyzed spectrum
are recorded simultaneously at the output and not on the individual fre-

quency components. Its operation is analogous to the operation of the
multichannel electronic spectral analyzer. The number of channels is
determined by the nuaber of resolved points.

As has already been indicated N defines the number of channels of the
equivalent multichannel spectral analyzer. It is necessary to note that
the band of the acoustooptical spectral analyzer AP, the ultrasonic
modulator of which operates in the Ranaagﬂutt diffraction node cannot
exceed ~70! of the basic frequency [3].

By using the developed spectral analyser. a study was made of the spectra
of several signals. 0n feeding the signal to the pieaoconverter of the
ultrasonic modulator in the focal plane of an integrating lens. the spectrum
of the signal was recorded. The intensity distribution of the light field
was recorded on photographic film. In addition. it was recorded using a
moving slit diaphrags after which there was an ran-27 photonultiplier.

The signal from the photomultiplier passed through the 01-7 electrometric
amplifier to the "-110 pen recorder. For monitoring the operation of the
scoustooptical spectral analyser, the electronic spectral analysis circuit
was introduced which was included in parallel to the piesoeonverter. The

shape and spectrum of the investigated signals were recorded by the 81-31
oscillograph and the Sh-2S spectral analyser.

One of the investigated signals was an amplitude-modulated oscillation

with a carrier frequency of 36 megahertz. a modulation frequency of

1.5 megahertz and a modulation depth of 1002. The spectrum of the signal
photographed from the screen of the SA-ZS device and a photograph of the
light intensity distribution in the focal plane. respectively. were pre-
sented in Fig 2. a. b. The measured frequency resolution for the given
model was ~130 kiloherts. The calculated value obtained from expression (5)
is 110 kilohsrta. The number of resolved points in our case was ~200.

By using the acoustooptical analyser it is possible also to perform a
successive analysis of the spectrum. In this case. a moving light spot
will be observed in the focal plane. the instantaneous position of which
corresponds to the frequency of the signal propagated in the light guide.
The effect of the movement of the light beam can be used to create
deflectors in the information readout systems. for the creation of the

deflection device and the system for formation of the television image.
and so on.

If it is necessary to analyse the spectrum of several signals simultaneously.
then by using the two-dimensionality of the optical system it is possible
to create a spatial-multichannel spectral analyser {3]. the integrating

lens of which must be cylindrical. In the spatial-multichannel ultrasonic
modulator used in this analyser. the relation between the channels must be
absent. Each channel of this dwice canhaveitsown operating frequency.
The condition that the channels of the multichannel spectral analyser be
decoupled imposes defined requirements on the structural design of the
ultrasonic modulator. If the sound guide of the modulator is a monolithic
unit. then the admissible channel density is determined by the diffraction
divergence of the ultrasonic wave. in the case where great density of the

channels is necessary. it is possible to use a sound guide with mechanically
separated channels [5].

The distribution of the sound field of the eight-channel modulator with
distributed channels is presented in Fig 3. From the figure it is obvious
that the relation between the channels was in practice absent.

The multichannel ultrasonic light modulators in the systems for coherent
optical data processing can be used not only for analysis of the spectrum

of the input signals. but also for the solution of a number of other
problems. for example. for processing the antenna array signals [6]. As
was demonstrated in [7]. when processing the antenna array signals it is
possible to use multichannel ultrasonic modulators with overlapping

najority of models the converters were attached to the sound guides using

indium binding layers by the Method of thermal compression.

  

The resonance frequencies and bands of all of the channels were in practice
identical. The input impedances had scattering not exceeding 101. In

the piezoconverter. In the case of cophesal excitation of all of the

HIGR~FRBQUBNCY SOLID-STATE ULTRASONIC LIGﬂT MODULATORS
[Article by Ye. T. Ahsenov. N. A. Yeaepkina. V. A. Markov. V. P. Piksrnikov]

[Text] The ultrasonic diffraction light modulators are prospective
devices for signal input to the optical data processing system. The ultra—
sonic nodulators operate in real tine and can be both single-channel and
multichannel. An important parameter of such nodulatore is the frequency
band. and in the case of the multichannel modulators. the admissible
density of the arrangement of the ultrasonic channel with given magnitude
of the coupling between then.

It is possible to expend the frequency band and increase the density of the
placement of the channels by increasing the operating frequency of the
modulator to frequencies of hundreds of megahertz. On such frequencies

the lragg diffraction regime is realised which has a number of advantages

by comparison uith the Ramen-Nutt regimes: greater efficiency. greater
dynamic range, and so on.

In this article the results are presented from studying multichannel
solid state ultrasonic light modulators on frequencies above 100 megahertz.

In the high-frequency ultrasonic light modulators spin-filn and plate
half-wave pieroconverters are used. In the investigated models of

the modulators. the half-wave plate made of lithium niobate Y+36‘ cut 1,
fastened to the sound guides 3 made of fused quartz using indium binding
layer 2 (see Fig l) were used as the pieroconvertera. 0n frequencies
above 100 megahertz the thickness of this layer is comparable to the sound
wave length. and therefore its effect must be considered when finding the
input impedance of the pieroconverter.

Before making the transition to a discussion of the experimental results.
let us determine the input impedance of piezoconverter. The knowledge of
the magnitude of the input impedance permits us to estimate the conversion
losses and their dependence on the frequency, and to find the conditions
of matching the piesoconverter to the generator. and so on.

depends on the parameters of the binding layer. The magnitude of this
acoustic impedance can be determined by using the formulas presented in

indicated configuration and the layer of the mentioned thickness were used
in our models of the modulator.

The experimentally measured frequency-amplitude characteristics agree well
with the calculated ones.

In the investigated models of the multichannel (the number of channels
from 20 to 30) modulators lithium niobste Y+36° cut plates were used as
the piaaoconvertars operating on the basic resonance frequency of ~200
megahertz. The sound guides were monolithic units of fused quarts
lSXbSX7S nm3. Their operating faces were made by the method of precision
optical grinding and polishing with a precision on the order of 1/6.

The converter plates were fastened to the sound guides through the indium
binding layers approximately 6 microns thick using the process discussed
in [A]. The traveling sound wave in the sound guide was created by
bevelimg the end opposite to the one on which the pieeoconverter was
located at an angle of .5' to the direction of propagation of the sound.
The electrodes 0.71:5 are2 with spacing of 1.5 see were deposited on the
converter plate.

The excitation voltage was fed to the modulator channel from the 66-5
generator through the strip exponential power divider [5]. Using this
divider it was possible simultaneously to excite 15 channels. Hham measur4
ing the optoacoustic parameters of the modulator. it was illuminated by

the light of the Lc~36 optical generator through the collimating system

of lenses. The distribution of the diffracted light intensity was observed
in the focal plane of the output lens located beyond the modulator. The
frequency functions for the intensity of the diffracted light were picked
up with constant excitation voltage of 1 volt on the piesoconverter. The
frequency characteristics of the modulator channels were in practice
identical. The standard characteristics are presented in Pig 2. Curve 1
was recorded with tuning on each frequency of the angle of incidence of

the light on the modulator so that the intensity of the diffracted light
will be neximal. Curve 2 was recorded with invariant orientation of the
modulator with respect to the incident light. The Bragg angle was in this
case set for a frequency of 210 megahertz. It is obvious that the pass
band with respect to the half-intensity level is approximately $0 megahertz.
The measured frequency characteristics are in qualitative accordance with
the calculated ones. A study was made of the operation of the model for
cophasal equal amplitude excitation of its 16 channels. The shadow dis-
tribution pattern of the sound field in the modulator was measured which
indicated that the sound beams of the individual channels almost do not
overlap with respect to the entire modulator aperture.

The distribution of the light field at the diffraction peak of the 1st
order and the diagram of this distribution obtained in the focal plane
of the output lens are presented in Pig 3. a. b. The diagram of the
light field distribution was obtained using a moving slit diaphragm
behind which the rev-21 photomultiplier was located. The signal from

the photomultiplier passed through the 01-7 amplifier to the N-llo pen
recorder.

HULTICRANNEL ACOUSTOOPTICAL MODULATOR HIT“ OVERLAPPING ULTRASONIC BEAMS

[Article by Ye. T. Aksenov. N. A. Bukharin. V. A. Grigor'yev.
S. V. Pruss-Zhukovskiy]

[Text] In the system for optical processing of antenna array signals
investigated in reference [1]. the light flux modulation is realized by
a multichannel acoustooptical modulator.

The dimensions of the modulator converter electrodes. their repetition
period, the size of the modulator with respect to the direction of
propagation of the ultrasonic waves andthe operating frequency were
selected in such a way that the waves propagated from the adjacent
converters are nonoverlapping ultrasonic means. Here. ultrasonic waves in
the near zone of each emitter are used for light modulation so that in
each beam the modulation is realised independently of the others.

Let us investigate the possibility of optical processing of the signals

of s multielement antenna where the field in the far zone of an individual
emitter of ultrasonic waves within the near zone of the entire array of
emitters as a whole is used for the light modulation. Here the ultrasonic
waves corresponding to the individual elements of the piezoconverter can
overlap.

Let us consider the light diffraction on ultrasonic waves generated by
an electroacoustic converter of finite dimensions for arbitrary ratio

between its size N and the ultrasonic wave length A, Fig 1. Let us give
the excitation function of the ultrasonic wave emitter

[Text] The diffraction ultrasonic light modulators are finding broad
application in various systems for optical signal processing as the data
input device in real time and also in the laser beam scanning systems

with high resolution. The achievements in the field of obtaining wide
band. high-frequency piezoconverters [1-3] and also the appearance of new
single crystals having small acoustic losses and large diffraction activity
[6] made it possible to create ultrasonic light modulators for frequencies
above 100 megahertz operating in the Bragg diffraction mode [5. 6].

The frequency band of the ultrasonic light modulator is defined by the pass
band of the piezoconverter with an electric cycle and the effective optical
acoustic interaction band. Here a study is Iade of the effective optical

acoustic interaction band for modulators operating in the Bragg diffraction
regime.

known, for the Debye-Sears modulators the upper cutoff frequency does not

EFFECT OF MANUFACTURING AND ADJUSTMENT INPRECISION ON TNB OPERATION OF

[Text] when designing an optical data processing system it is possible

to consider the imprecision occurring in the process of asnufscturing end
adjusting its elements. The consideration of the effect of the imprecision
permits first of all determination of the admissible deviations of the
parameters of the elements from the calculated values and. secondly.
estimation of the difficulties and the theoretical possibility of imple-
menting the system.

In this article a theoretical and experiaental study is made of the effect
of imprecision on the operation of an optical data processing system which
is made up (see Fig 1) of a source of coherent optical emission. a
telescopic system that expands the light beam (the lenses L1 and L2),

a light modulator or a data input device, the integrating lens L3 and the
recorder (FY). In the case of experimental investigation. the LG—36 type
laser was used as the coherent light source; two collimator tubes of the
OSK-Z optical bench were used for expansion of the beam and integration

of the inage. The multichannel diffraction type water modulator was used
in the model [1. 2]. Structurally, it was in the form of a couvette filled

with distilled water in which ultrasonic oscillations were excited by
using piezoelectric converters.

The light distribution in the focal plane of the integrating lens bearing
information on the signals coming to the modulator was recorded by a
photorecuivar (FEU [photomultiplier]). The radiation was incident on the
cathode of the PRU through a narrow slit. and after detection and amplifica-
tion, the signal was recorded on the pen recorder tape (type N110).

The results are presented below from the calculations and the experimental
investigation of imprecision which can occur during the manufacture and
adjustment of the elements entering into the system (the lens. the recorder.
modulator). and the effect of these imprecisions on its operation. The
basic quality criterion of the operation of the system was the form of the
diffraction spot recorded by the pen recorder.

Collimator Lenses

The lenses L1 and L2 of the eyepiece and the objective of the first
collimator tube are used for creation of the quite broad coherent light

The effect of the precision with which the collilstor lenses are set on

A study was also made of the quality of the collinator lenses. For this
purpose. the diaphragns of.various sizes were placed in the vertical
plane between the objectives L2 and L3 so that the light passing through
tho various sections of the lenses waa diffracted. The diephragns

50x5 and 75x5 an and also lOOXlO and l£0x20 mm were used. The experiment
did not reveal any significant worsening of the diffraction pattern for
ahifting of the diaphragm to the edges of the lenses or increasing the
dinensions of the diaphragn.

Recorder

The plane of the receiving slit of the device eust coincide with the

focal plane of the objective L3; otherwise the above-described distortions
of the recorded signal occur. The distortion of the signal also occurs

if the slit is displaced nonperpendicular to the optical axis. for during
novelsnt the receiving slit leaves the focal plane of the objective L3.

Another source of the signal distortions is connected with the finiteness
of the width of the receiving slit. la the case of finite width of the
slit. the intensity distribution at the output will be expressed by the
integral

where f(€) is the true distribution of the intensity in the plane of the
receiving set: (0. f are the nor-sliced coordinates; a is the norneliced
halfwidth of the slit. Using the results of calculating the integral (6).
it is possible to find the naxinun slit width not distorting the output
signal significantly. The calculation shows that the slit width must be

no more than 20! of the width of the main lobe of the diffraction distribu-
tion with respect to the zero level. For Pal600 ll. 0-60 an, l-0.63 nicrons.
a slit width of no sore than 3 uicrons is required. In order to enlarge

the diffraction pattern. it is possible to use an additional lens. As

increase in the depth of the image by n2 times. The requirements on
adjustment of the recorder will be lessened by as many times. However.
the auxiliary lens must he installed with the same precision with which
the recorder is installed in the system without the auxiliary lens.

The experiments confirmed the calculated data pertaining to the selection

of the receiving slit width and the effectiveness of using an additional
lens to enlarge the diffraction pattern.

Ultrasonic Modulator

Phase distortions of the light wave front connected with defects in the
processing and gluing of the couvette and nonuniformities of the water
medium and also amplitude and phase distortions caused by dispersion of
the voltagea which excite the ultrasonic oscillations can arise in the
modulator of the given type.

The quality of the couvette used was investigated by recording the
diffraction pattern from the light passing through its various sections.
The measurements performed both for an empty couvette and for a couvette
filled with water demonstrated that the quality of the diagrams remains
good to apertures of SOXSS and 60x55 mm (Pig 4. a and b respectively).

Calculations were also performed pertaining to bending of the plate with
piezoconverters which leads to two effects: a change in direction of
propagation of the ultrasonic waves and an additional phase shift of them.
It is demonstrated that for the case of modulators with a large number of
elements the first effect can be neglected. and the additional phase shift
turns out to be on the first and higher orders of the diffraction pattern

just as the quadratic error in the light distribution. hence. it follows
that for an admissible phase shift of s/2 and ale the bending of the

plate does not exceed a quarter or an eighth of the wave length of the
ultrasonic oscillation respectively. If the deflection exceeds the

shift into the excitation channels of the piezoconvertsr.

As a result of the investigation. the requirements on the adjustment and
nanufacture of the elements of an optical data processing system have been
defined. It is demonstrated that the equipment used in this model is
suitable for the creation of a practical version of the system. The
results of the calculations and the experiments pertaining to the lenses
and the recorder are also valid for systems of other types, for example.

CALCULATION 0? TN! INTENSITY OF LIGHT SCATTERED BY ACOUSTIC HAVBS IN
AN LiNb03 CRYSTAL

[Article by B. s. Abesgauz. V. I. Yevdokimov. A. G. Kuzin. V. V. Soroka.
A. S. Shcherbakov]

[Text] The interest in the acoustooptical modulators and deflectors using
the phenomenon of light diffraction on ultrasonic waves in crystals is
growing with every year. From the point of view of practical applications
the high-frequency acoustooptical devices are especially prospective, for
the transition to high frequencies will permit significant improvement of
the parameters of the modulators and deflectors. for example. it will make
it possible to obtain large scanning angles of the laser light beam. to
process complex signals with a large product of the frequency band times
the duration. and so on.

however. the transition to high frequencies imposes rigid requirements on
the materials used in the optical-acoustic devices which must have large

photoelastic coefficients. low damping of the sound and have good optical
uniformity and transparency.

An important factor is also the degree of perfection of the process of
obtaining materials. Out of all the admissible materials known at the
present time. the most prospective for the high-frequency acoustooptical
devices is the LiNb03 crystal in which a very low attenuation of the
hypersound with high optical and photoelsstlc properties are combined
successfully.

In addition. at the present time the industrial production of quite large
lithium-niobate crystals has been mastered. Therefore. a detailed
quantitative analysis of the various aspects of the interaction of light
and sound waves with different propagation directions and polarizations
in LiNh03 crystals is of interest.

In the present paper a study is made of the results of the numerical
calculations of the intensity of the light scattered by sound waves in the
crystals. As was demonstrated by one of the authors (ll.‘the general

expression for the intensity of the scattered light during Bragg diffraction

of the light on ultrasound in an arbitrary anisotropic medium has the form

Here J1 is the intensity of the diffracted light in the first diffraction
order; Jo is the intensity of the light in the zero order.k g- :gnd and

kp-kp n are the wave vectors of the diffracted and incident t waves.

L is pthe width of the acoustic bean; Np and N are the unit vectors of the
polarization of the incident and diffracted light: 3° is the undisturbed
tensor B which is the inverse of the tensor of the relative dielectric
constant: b is the second class tensor describing the disturbance of the
tensor 3 caused by deformation of the medium on propagation of the sound
wave in it. The components of the perturbation tensor are as follows:

bis ' lp/almqrum.' .

Here 1. k. i. m - l. 2. 3; ijlm is the photoelastic tensor of the crystals;

q and 0° are the wave vector and the vector of the sound wave displacement
amplitude; i is an imaginary unit.

Formula (1) is valid when the angle of incidence of the light is equal to
the Bragg angle. the intensity of the sound wave is small. the angles of
incidence and diffraction of the light are small.

Thus. in order to find the intensity of the diffracted light for any direc-
tions and polarizations of the light and sound waves it is necessary to know
the magnitudes and directions of the vectors q. “0.. and kd which we shall
find by solving the Christoffel [2] and Fresnel [31 nations for the
corresponding directions of propagation of sound and light waves. In the
general case the solutions of these equations and the calculations by
formula (1) present an extraordinarily complex and difficult problem. How-
ever. if we are dealing with a specific crystal. with known acoustic and
optical properties. then it is expedient to perform the same calculations
on a computer as for the Liﬂb03 crystal.

He shall give the directions of the wave vector q of the sound wave by the
spherical angular coordinates 0 (the angle between the optical axis c and q)
and o (the azimuthal angle). Considering that the photoelastic properties
of lithium niobate are characterized by the 3d-order axis of symmetry
coinciding with the optical axis c. the calculations were performed for the
angles 0 from 0 to 180° and e from 0 to 120' with a step of 10‘.

In the calculations it was proposed that the angles of incidence and
scattering of the light are so small that the incident and scattered light
beams can he considered colinear and perpendicular to the vector q. This
condition in quite well satisfied for all of the real sound frequencies

If the diffraction is not accompanied by rotation of the light polarization

in the case of anisotropic diffraction [6] of the light on the ultrasound
accompanied by rotation of the light polarization plane, the condition of
smallness of the angles of incidenCe and diffraction occur only in the
weakly anisotropic media in some sound frequency range. Therefore the
results presented below from calculating the intensity of the diffracted
light for anisotropic diffraction in LiNb03 are of an spproxisate nature.
for the optical anisotropy of the lithium niobste is quite large. Never-
theless. these calculations are of definite interest. for they permit

at least qualitative solution of the problem of the optimal configuration

of the anisotropic Bragg diffraction for which the intensity of the
diffracted light is the greatest.

The values of the elastic “02311 of LiNbO for the calculations were taken
equal to the following in 10 dynes/cn2 [5]: c11-20.16; c12-5.67;
c13-7.so; clé-o.93; c33-26.50; Cgé-6.01.

The LiNb03 crystal is a strong piezoelectric; therefore for calculations
of q and "0 i: is necessary to consider the piezo effect. In particular.
these vectors for any given direction of the sound wave with a unit vector

of the wave normal n were determined by solving the following tensor
equations [6]:

wheels-aw: m

low-frequency relative dielectric constant in the direction of propagation

(nf)1°(nf)k. If we set the piezo moduli equal to O in (2) and (3)

we obtain the ordinary Christoffel equations [2].

For the solution of these equations. independent tensor coaponents of the
low-frequency relative dielectric constant were used [7] ell-66.0 and
033-29.0 and the independent components of the piezoelectric tensor

(in satrix notation) were taken as follows in 105 Cgs electrostatic units
[7]: 83,-3.90; 831-0.60; BIS-11.1; 316'7'5'

For calculations of q and U0. the density of Lihb03 was taken equal to
6.6666 g/ca3 [5]. finally. the values of the conponents of the photo-
elastic tensor were taken from reference [8]: p 1-0.025; p 2-0.079;

SOHE CHARACTERISTICS OF T38 ACOUSTOOPTICAL INTERACTIOﬂ IN o-QUARTZ AND
LITHIUM NIOIATB

[Article by V. V. Soroka. A. l. Shishkin, A. S. Shcherbakov]

[Text] The application of crystal sound guides in acoustoopticsl devices.
for example. in deflectors is of great interest at the present tine. A
number of crystals are known with high efficiency of their aeoustaopticsl
interaction, but the nest widespread materials are o-quartz (c-Sioz) and
lithium niobste.

The purpose of this paper was investigation of some of the characteristics
of acoustooptical interaction in the indicated crystals. which is needed

for optimization of the configuration of the scattering on creation of the
acoustooptical devices.

For excitation of longitudinal elastic waves in o-quartz. a thin-film cas-
converter was applied to the z-cut of the crystal. In the LiNb03 sample,

the longitudinal and slow transverse elastic waves propagated along the
x-axis were excited as a result of the natural pieso effect. The type of
elastic waves was controlled by the oscillograns of the echoes which
demonstrated that there was no fast sheer wave in the lithium niobste sample.
The length of the acoustooptieal iateraction in the a-quarts was -10'3 a,

and in lithium niobste it was ~10 microns.

The experiment was performed by the setup in [1) in which the polarisation
of the incident and diffracted light was controlled. The light source was
the He-Ne laser. lo-O.6328 microns. The range of operating frequencies of

the coaxial-strip microwave channel was 0.5-0.9 gigshertc with a power of
the signal source of about 1 watt.

In the experiments with lithium niobste. a study was made of the light
diffraction both on the longitudinal elastic waves without rotation of
polarization and on the slow shear wave with rotation of polarization.

As is demonstrated. for example. in [2] the lost convenient section of the
angular frequency runctions for use in the deflectors is the region near

"are V In the upuvd of sound: A is the wavelength of the light in a vacuum;
no and ne are the principal indexes of refraction of the crystal: 9 is the
angle between the optical axis of the medium and the dispersion plans on
which the wave vectors of the incident light and the elastic wave lie.

The selection of the orientation of the dispersion plane thus determines
the value of f0. The angle s-l2° which corresponds to f0-0.82 gigaherts.

The experiment was performed in the Bragg diffraction regime. for the
condition indicated in [3] A L/nAzsl (L is the interaction length of the
light with hypersound; A is ghe elastic wave length) jointly with the
requirement of the quality of the angle of incidence to the Bragg angle
were satisfied. The light scattering configuration on hypersound in the
lithium niobate (OI-12') and a-quartz (0-0) samples is presented in Fig l, a
and l. b respectively.

The effective photoelsstic constants corresponding to the dispersion con-
figuration (Pig 1) and using natural polarizations of the incident light
and also the scoustooptieal interaction band pertain to the investigated
characteristics of the acoustooptical interaction.

Photoelastic Constants

The values of the effective photoelastic constants for e-quartz and lithium
niobate under the assumption of small angles of incidence 61 and diffraction
°d of light can be found by the results of reference [a]. The ratio of the
intensities of the diffracted light J1 to the intensity of the incident
light Jo is defined as:

where ki-Zrnilxog n1 is the index of refraction for the incident light;

c'1 is the tensor of the inverse of the tensor of the dielectric constant

tensor; N1 and “d are the polarizations of the incident and diffracted

light.

In thia paper. the acou-Looptical band was measured for the cases of the
dispersion configuration in Fig l. The electric feed circuits were tuned

on each frequency in the operating hand. 0n variation of the angle of
incidence of the light on the sample in both directions from the optimal

the values of the angles of incidence were recorded for which the intensity
of the signal was cut in half along with the angle 01 corresponding to the

maxi-a1 intensity in the diffracted light.

The results of the measurements and the calculation curves in the case of
light diffraction on longitudinal elastic waves without polarization

The significant difference in magnitudes of the acoustooptical band in the
investigated samples is connected with the fact that the interaction
length L in the quartz was approximately in tines less than in the lithium

niobate.

An estimate was also node of the acoustooptical hand on diffraction of the

OPTICAL HBTHODS 0P INVESTIGATING The CHARACTERISTICS OF RADIOTBLESCOPES
[Article by I. A. Vodovatov. c. K. Vinogradov. ﬂ. 6. Vyaotekiy. 8. A. Rogov]

[Text] In recent tiaea the optical eethode of [1. 2] have becoae more and
more wideapread in antenna acaeureaent engineering. Ae a reeult of the
creation of coherent radiation eourcea (laaere). the poaaibility hae
occurred for the eiaulation of the antennae in the optical band which in a
number of caeee haa eiaplified the inveetigetion of their characteriatica.
Holography which pernite eiaulation of antennae with different lawn of
variation of phaee and aeplitude in the aperture ia opening up new poeei-
bilitica in thia area. The indicated nethode are eepecially proapective
for large antennae and antennae of coaplex configuration where obtaining

the characterietice by direct neaaureaent or by calculation ie connected
with eignificent difficultiea.

Thie report containe a deacriptian of the procedure. and acne of the exper-
iacntnl renulta are preaented with reepect to optical eiaulation of the
antennae of radioteleecopee. In particular, a etudy wae nade of the
radiation patterna and the frequency-space characterietice of the radio-
teleecopea with antennae of variable profile: the large Polkovo radio-
teleecope and the RATAﬂ-ooo redioreleacope [3]. The axperiaanta were per-
foraed for uniforn cophaeal excitation and alao for warioue lawn of varia-
tion of phaae aaplitude of the field in the aperture which were given by
eepccially aanufactured holographic filtere. In addition. by ueing the

holographic aethod the study wee aade of the polarization characterietice
of the antenna enieeion.

The acheaatic for aeaeuring the radiation pattern ia einilar to that
deacribed in referencee [2. 6]. The been of coherent light from the laaer
ia expanded ueing a teleecopic eyetea andilluninatee the optical aodel of
the antenna. The diffraction pattern in the focal plane of the collecting
lane correaponda to the radiation pattern of the antenna. The difference
of the given eyetea from the eyeteae ueed by the authore of referencee

when checking the effectiveness of the method a study was made of the
model of an antenna having rectangular aperture. the phase of which varied
according to a quadratic law. The form of the diffraction spot in the
first diffraction order corresponded to the radiation pattern of the
antenna in the presence of quadratic phase errors. when the uniforn
diffraction grating was used as the holographic filter. the distributions
in the first and null diffraction orders were analogous. The results
obtained were compared with the data of reference [5] where a study was
made of the effect of the quadratic phase errors on the operation of the
optical data processing system.

In addition. by using special diffraction gratings. the distribution of
the cross-polarisation component of the field in the aperture of the
symmetric antennas of the type of a paraboloid of rotation [6) and

asymmetric antennas of the type of antennas of variable profile was simu-
lated l .

In order to investigate the space-frequency characteristics of the radio-
telescope antennas. two methods were used. The first method was connected
with mutual displacement of two identical apertures of the antenna models
with the information on the phase and amplitude distribution and the antenna
aperture recorded on them by the holographic procedure [8]. As is known

[9). the space-frequency characteristic of the antenna in the case of
operation with incoherent sources coincides with the autocorrelation function
R(x0.yo) of the field distribution 8(x.y) in the antenna aperture

Rita yd-Hﬂx. ylf‘it— x.. y - dexdy.

where x.y are the coordinates in the plane of the antenna aperture: x0.y

is the nutual displacement of two apertures. If we illnainate the apertupea
perpendicularly to the beam of coherent light incident on them with a
plane phase front. than. depending on the experimental conditions in the
zero or first orders of the diffraction. the energy will be proportional
to the value of the autocorrelation function or the square of it.

Measurements were made of the space and the frequency characteristics for
the antenna of the earns-too radiotelescope on the optical models
corresponding to operation on a wave length of 1-1.6 cm for angles of
elevation of 0-0. 30. 90‘. The measurements were made in the zero order
for the cases of uniform field distribution in the aperture and the dis-
tribution of the field falling on the edges of the aperture. It was
discovered. in particular. that a decrease in the field asplitude at the
edges of the antenna is accompanied by a rise of the space-frequency
characteristic on the average frequencies and a decrease of it on the high
frequencies. As an example, Fig 1 shows the images of models of the
antenna apertures of the mamas-coo radiotelescope shifted by half the
longitudinal dimension (antenna diameter 600 meters) corresponding to
operation on 1-1.6 cm. 0-90'. The radius of the outside circle r512 mm.

INVESTIGATION OF SURFACE ROUONNBSS BY COHERENT OPTICAL METHODS
[Article by T. G. Alksis, H. H. autusov. N. V. Yarnakova]

[Text] The shape of the nicrounevennesses of the rough surfaces of the
najority of actual objects is described by a random function of the
coordinates £€x.y). One of the sinpleet characteristics of the rando-
surfnce is the mean square deviation (dispersion) of the surface with
respect to the average level

where "(c.x) is the distribution probability density of the surface alti-
tudes. At the present tine there in no solution to the general problem

of the extraction of inforsation on the structure of the statistically
nonunifors surfaceo from the light dispersion characteristics. Theoretically.
this problen was investigated in [l] for two liniting cases.

The actual surface sost frequently is nultiparanetric. that is, it In an
intersediate type of surface between two calculated approximations. The
theoretical analysis of the dispersion process is cosplicated in this
respect. However, in order to develop the criteria for coherent-optical
analysis of the quality of processing of the surfaces it is useful to

find empirical relations between the characteristics of the scattered field
and the surface characteristics (for example. the dispersion).

Deter-ination of Roughness by the Scattering Index of Coherent Light

In order to record the scattering index. the samples were illuminated by
the undiluted been of the L6-36 laser. The special measurements and also
the calculations [1] indicate that the variation of the illuninstion
angle within the liaits free 0 to 30‘ has no effect on the scattering
index. In order to simplify the optical system. we used the illumination
of the sample at an angle of 20‘. The intensity of the scattered light
was ncssured by the arc scanning photosultiplier. the output signal of
which was fed to the vertical asplifier of the two-coordinate pen recording
device. The sovesent of the photomultiplier was synchronised with the
horizontal displacement of the pen recorder slide. fig 1 shows the
nor-sliced scattering indexes of glass plates treated with standard.

noted toward constriction of the index with a decrease in abrasive grain
size. that is. with improvement of quality of treatment of the surface.
This effect can be explained within the framework of the method of the
tangential plane. according to the conclusions of which the index for the
surface with normal distribution of slopes depends on the ratio of the

correlation radius f to the dispersion of the unevenneaees o. For example.

The shape of the microprofilogrems taken on the standard profilometer
permits the proposition that as the abrasive grain size diminishes, a
gradual "truncation" of the tips of the large-scale unevennesses takes
place. "are the average correlation size of the surface (the large-scale
nonuniformitiea are considered) varies little. and the altitude dispersion
02 decreases. According to formula (1). with a decrease in all the
scattering index must become constricted. Obviously. the diffraction on
the microunevennesses covering the large unevennesses has a smaller effect
on the scattering index (as follows from the perturbation theory) than the
processes of geometric reflection from the feces of these nonuniformities.
Therefore, on the whole this decrease implies compression of the scattering
index.

The analysis of indexes obtained demonstrated that their shape can be

described with s sufficiently degree of accuracy by the following empirical
formula:

7357 ”4.5.3

where A is the constant defined by the material of the sample and the
experimental conditions (in our case A is 0.76); B is the halfwidth of
the experimental curves obtained.

Thus. by the measured hnlIwidth of the scattering index it is possible to
find the mean square deviations of the surface with respect to the average
level which is the quality criterion of the processing of the surface.

Determination of Surface Roughness Using a Prism Interferometer

Another method for determining the degree of surface roughness is the use
of an interferometer with a total internal reflection prism [2]. The opti-
cal diagram of the experiment is shown in Fig 2. The interferomter l with
the sample 2 is illuminated by a collimated beam from the LG-36 laser.

In the focal plane 6 of the lens 3 spatial separation of the light signals
reflected from the hypotenuse of the prism 10 and from the sample I takes

place. The magnitude of these signals i: measured by the photoreceivers 5-
and 6.

In order to achieve satisfactory spatial separation of the signals from
the face and sample the angle between the sample and the face must be on
the order of a tenth of a degree if the focal length of the lens 3‘2 m.
In the experiment the required angle between the sample and the face of
the prism can be created if one edge of the sample is placed on a step
about 50 to 100 microns high (depending on the sample size).

Good comparison of the results obtained with the data from the microprofilo-
grams offers the possibility of using this method also for determining the
height dispersion of the unevennesses of the rough surface.

Thus. the application of several coherent-optical mcthods of investigation
of the rough surfaces is possible.

The methods making use of the prism interferometer offer the possibility of
obtaining average information on the entire investigated surface quite
rapidly. The deficiencies of these methods lust include the effect of

the nonplaneness of the samples and the inaccuracy of installation of them
with respect to the illuminating bean.

The method of the dispersion indexes less critical with respect to the
illumination angle. and its optical system is more compact. However, the
time for obtaining the information is greater. and the information itself

is of a local nature. for it pertains only to the illuminated section of
the surface.

HOLOGRAPHIC METHOD OF INVESTIGATING THE hISTORTION OF THE HAVE FRONT BY
THE ACTIVE ELEMENTS OF A SOLID-STATE LASER DURING TﬂE PUMPING PERIOD

[Article by A. A. Bugayev. H. M. Butusov]

[Text] The propagation of an electromagnetic wave in the direction perpen-
dicular to which nonuniform distribution of the index of refraction occurs
in the active elements of the solid state lasers and masers is accompanied
by distortion of tho wave front of the transmitted radiation. For the
pumping period when the calculation of the nonuniform distribution of the
index of refraction with respect to cross section of the active elements is
complicated by the presence of energy transitions in the inverse medium [1]
and also the temperature dependence of the coefficient of spectral absorption
[2]. preference is given to the experimental methods of investigating the
distortions of the wave front. The methods used previously are as follows:
recording of the radiation on the photographic plate [3], autocollimstion
[b] and measurement of the effective focal length [5] cannot exactly
describe the wave front passing through the active element if the center
and radius of curvature of the surface of this wave front are variable.

In this paper the distortions of the wave front by the active element during
the pumping period were investigated by the holographic procedure [6] with
respect to the Mach-lender interferometer system. The subsequent reproduc-
tion of the subject wave P carried out with respect to the ordinary reproduc-
tion system [6] permits a detailed investigation of the profile of the
distorted wave front in real time. For simplification of the experimental
technique. a film of the KN-Z type was used as the recording medium. the
sensitivity of which with an exposure time of 10‘3 seconds offers the possi-
bility of using the Lc~75 operating in the single-mode regime in the role of
the source. The recording of the hologram was made under the conditions
where the carrier frequency of the interference grating u-sin 0/1 (0 is the
angle between the reference and subject beam. A is the wave length of the
investigated emission) is close to 0.

As was stated above. the distortions of the plane wave passing through the
active element are of a nature such that the reproduced subject wave R and
its complex-conjugate R* form images of the source of spherical (bright
point) or cylindrical (bright line) waves. Inasmuch as the carrier frequency
of the interference grating is close to zero, the reproduced images of the

117

sources are located on the axis of the hologram [6] on both sides of it.
and the inage of one of then is always accompanied by the defocussed other
one. However. as the cxperisents show. the real and imaginary images of
the source are located at a significant distance fros each other. and
therefore they are easily distinguishable.

According to [6]. it is also possible to state that in the case where one
and the some collimated reference waves F is used on recording and reproduc-
tion of the hologram. and the coordinates of the iaage are no. yo and so.
the coordinates of the reproduced imaginary and reel issges will be x0. y .
to and x0. y . '30. respectively. Thus. the application of the holographgc
procedure wi?l permit perforaance not only of a qualitative analysis but
also a quantitative analysis of the distortions of the wave front of the
radiation passing through the active element.

in our paper studies are made of the distortions of the wave front of the
radiation caused hy the plane or cylindrical actiVe elements during the
punplng period. As the cylindrical rod. a rod node of Obs-l type neodyaiun
ulass 8xl30 on was used. The pmnping of the actiwe elements was carried
out by the [PP-1200 tube. The reflector was aade in the fern of a nono-
lithic quarts block. The plane active elenent node of Obs-l glass had
dimensions of 8X20x120 an. The pumping of it was realized by two [PP-1200
tuhes through the side surface. The tubes were arranged along the optical
axis of the active ale-ant. In both cases the pulping tubes and active
elesent were cooled by running water through independent channels. The
exposure of the negative took place 3 to 6 pumping periods after the tise
of switching on the tubes. The distortions of the wave front were investi-
gated in the pulping energy range of 500-1000 joules for a cylindrical
active element and 500-2000 joules for a plane active elelent.

Figure l

 

0n the basis of the holograas obtained. it is possible to draw the conclu-
sion that the wave front will becose diverging after the active eleaent.

The reproduced image of the source of diverging waves for a flat active
element is in the for. of two bright horizontal lines. Consequently. the

or the distortions are not introduced. Thus. the effect of the aection
at the plane clvncnt on the tranaaitted plane wave can be likened to the
effect of the negativ« cylindrical lenn with a focal length P which is

uplit along its axle. and its halwea are separated at a diatance of Zh'
from each other (see Pig i).

As a reault of the meanureaents it was established that wil' an increase

in the pumping energy in the 500-000 joule range. a decrease in 2h' to a
value equal to the halfthichness of the active eieaent taken place. A
further increase in the pumping energy does not change the value of Zh'.

It in also neceusary to note that the distance iron the plane of the hole-
gran to the real iaage of the source renaina constant in the entire punping
energy range. Thus. the telperature profile occurring in the active element

of a flat shape beginning approximately with 800 joules is stabilized with
precision to a constant independently of the puaping energy.

in a cylindrical active ele-ent the reproduced image of the source of the
diVarging ane has the tors of an irregular circle. for the pulping of the
cylindrical active element has an explicitly expreased asyI-etric nature.
The lncrenae in pumping energy in the case of a cylindrical element leads
to the appearance of a trend toward insignificant decrease in the trans-

verae diaenaiona (in the plane perpendicular to the direction of propaga-
tion of the radiation) of the reproduced iaage.

The fact that the reproduced issges of the sources extend along the optical
axis of the active eleaent is significant for coaplete representation of
the nature of the distortions. if this element is cylindrical. then
beginning with the 800 joules. the transverse dimensions of the image along
the optical axis decrease. This leads to pulling of the irregular circle
toward the "point." (The diagrams of the lost characteristic reproduced
images of the source are presented in Pig 2.) The indicated phenolenon
obviously is caused by distortion of the bean trajectory in the Iediua of
the active element. based on the results obtained it is possible to state
that it is most expedient to realize correction of the theraal distortions
of the resonator oi the laser by the holographic aethod [7].

STUDY OF TUE VARIOUS SYSTEHS FOR TEE COhSTRUCTION OF A” AUTOMATED NUCLEAR
MAGNETOHBTER FOR PRECISE MEASUREMENT 0? THE VARIATIONS OF THE NONUNIFORH
MAGNETIC FIELDS

[Article by V. l. Dudhin. R. A. Zhitnikov. V. l. filimonov]

lTextl in certain problems of physics engineering it is necessary to
automatically measure the nonuniform magnetic fields with a high degree of
accuracy. Out of all of the known methods for this purpose obviously the
most suitable in the method of nuclear magnetic resonance in the current
sample with the use of the nutation effect [1-3]. This permits the transfer
of the observation of the nuclear magnetic resonance effect to a special
magnet with high field uniformity in the clearance and thus. as a result

of constriction of the nuclear magnetic resonance line and improvement of
the signal/noise ratio. to insure high precision. The construction of the
automatic magnetometer on this principle encounters a number of difficulties.
the basic one of which is connected with the fact that the speed and
dynamic error of the magnetometer are limited by the delay on transmission
of the information from the measuring sensor to the analysing unit.

The magnitude of the delay t-lIV. where i is the length of the connecting
tube hetween the measuring sensor and the sensor of the analyzer: V is the
speed with which the operating medium flows. Prom atructural arguments
usually it is difficult to make 1<0.l to 0.05 seconds. The presence of a

delay imposes defined conditions on the construction of the tracking system
of the magnetometer.

This paper is devoted to the creation of a nuclear magnetometer permitting
automatic recording of the variations in intensity of a highly nonuniform
magnetic field with high precision and sufficient speed for many circuits.

The principle of the use of mutation in a dynamic sample for measuring the
magnetic field is described in [1-3]. Fig 1 shows the block diagram of a

magnetometer. it is made up of four basic units: polarization and trans-

porting of the working medium I. the measuring device It and the analyzer

The magnetometer is designed for measuring the variations of the average
magnetic fields ("-800-1500 oersteds) with a relative gradient of 5°10 cm"1
and a variation range of :12. The model of the magnetometer was tested
with the permanent magnet 6 (n-iaoo ocrsteds) equipped with the coil 6

(see fig 1) by means of which the field variations were created. and

studies were made of the dynamic characteristics of the nagnetometer.

Psculiarities of the Automation of the heasurement Process and the
Construction of the Regulator

The automation of the process of compensation of the external magnetic
field is reduced to the construction of the automatic frequency control
system of the generator 17 (see Fig l). The structural diagram of this
system can he represented in the form of the following links (Pig 2):
delay 1. synchronous detector 2. regulator 3. high-frequency generator A.
converter 5 of the frequency to the magnetic field with the corresponding
transfer functions flip). Y2(p). Y (p). Y‘(p). and Y5(p). The converter 5
is an element taking into account ghe effect of the generator frequency

on the variation of the field of the magnet.

In order to select the system and method of calculating the regulator
parameters insuring the best static and dynamic characteristics of the
automatic magnetometer. it is necessary to obtain a matheeatical description
of the elements 1. 2. a and 5. This was achieved by analyzing the

reactions of these elements to the discontinuous input effect [6]. For
small ranges of variation of the variables when the entire system can be
considered as linear. the transfer functions of the sentionsd elements were
obtained in the form:

Vanuatu-pen Yam-17%;: moi-173g; r.-K..
where
K2-1.33 volts/oersteds; K‘-1.6 kilohertrlvolts; Ks-l/r-0.26 oersteda/
kiloherts; T2-0.68 sec: Tb-0.l sec; r-0.2 sec.
The presence in the mismatch circuit c (see Fig 2) of a delay r complicates
regulation. This is expressed in the slow reaction of the system and in

a tendency toward instability [6]. The analysis of the entire system when
using the static Y3-K3. astatic Y3'K3/p and isodromic

regulator indicates that the isodromic regulator which insures the best
Q-factor with respect to velocity and null static error (in practice the

static error is 30 hertz or 5010'6 with respect to H.,..) has the best
characteristics.

Fur thv given relative error n-Icl/nnnnx in procensinn the harmonic input
signal nH-dhn.xainwkt by a stable system it is sufficient that n(uk)>l/6
be satisfied. where A(u ) is the value of the modulus of the frequency
transfer function of the cpen system on the frequency of ”k' The increase
in this value of the saduius can take place as a result of an increase in
K3. For the isodromic regulator. the dependence of the critical value

of K, for which the system is located on the stability boundary on T, has
a maximum. For t-0.2 and T3-0.2$ we have Ka-lo. which for w -l.3 gives
6.0.18 (with respect to h..¢.-1A00 oerateds. do-l.8-10‘3). The time of
the transition process is units of seconds.

Thus. if the error in processing the signal statically for the given system
can be theoretically found equal to zero for traditional regulators. the
error dynamically and the time of the transition process are found to be
unacceptably large as a result of the tendency toward instability with an
increase in the amplification coefficient of the system. There are a number
of methods of improving the precision under dynamic conditions for the
systems with delay the basic ones of which are the following: the intro-
duction of a nonlinearity into the control law. the introduction of the
Smith predictorISI and extrapolator [6] into the system.

Introduction of Nonlinearities into the Control Law

The width of the region in which the characteristic of the synchronous
detector is close to linear is 2 oerateds. inasmuch as the variation

of the magnetic field can reach :3 oerateds. the characteristic of the
synchronous detector will be used in its essentially nonlinear part (in
the saturation zone). and the time of the transition process will increase
sharply. The decrease in this effect was realized by the regulator with
an amplification coefficient which varies as a function of the magnitude
of the mismatch. which was achieved by the application of the diode-resistive
limiting circuits. The application of such a regulator. as the experiment
demonstrated. made it possible to decrease the time of the transition
process by 302.

Smith Predictor

The application of the system with the Smith predictorlSl changes the
structural diagram of the system somewhat (see Fig 3).

determined by the stability of the subsystem described by the transfer
function Y(p). The reaction of the system to the input effect will

delay time.

The limits of stability of the system with the Smith predictor in the
region of the parameters K3 and T can be found. for example. using the
Naiquist criterion for the subsysgem with the transfer function Y(p).

in the realised Smith predictor. the era-2 constant delay unit and the
decision elements of the NWT-9 analog conputer were used.

The application of the Smith predictor permits a tenfold increase in the
critical asplification coefficient of the systoe. which leads to smaller
dynasic errors and decreases the time of the transient process by several
times. The investigation of the system in the harmonic signal processing
regile with an isodromic regulator demonstrated that with the introduction
of the Smith predictor the processing error diminished by approximately

an order: 60:10" with respect to n....-l‘00 oersteds.

Introduction to the Extrapolator Regulator

The extrapolator is included between the synchronous detector and the
regulator (see Fig 2) and with an accuracy determined by the selected

method of extrapolation reproduces the signal which must appear at the output
of the synchronous detector after the time t, thus excluding the delay from
the operation of the systes. The use of the Lagrange polynomial ln(t)

for the construction of the extrapolator will permit estimation of the
extrapolation error and for n-l. 2 sufficiently simple realization of linear
and quadratic extrapolators on the analog coeputer.

The investigation of the system under the conditions of processing a her-onic
nignal with an inndromic regulator and linear extrapolator demonstrated that
the increase in precision dynamically is approximately the same as with

the Smith predictor. however. the system with the estrapolator has lower
noiseproofness. which requires the use of filters at the system input.

Increasing the Stable Operating Zone of the Magnetometer

The sensitivity of the magnetomer is determined by the signal/noise ratio

in the analyzer and the steepness of the slope of the notation line at

the operating point (see Pig i. a). The smaller the segment Al (the width
of the notation line). the greater the steepness of the slope and the higher
the sensitivity of the magnetoeeter. The width of the nutation line

depends on nsny factors. but in our case. broadening connected with
nonuniformity of the measured magnetic field will he predoainant.

a) ll“

    

Figure a

The narrow nutation line permits us to increase the sensitivity of the
magnetoseter. but it limits the range of rates of seasureable variations
of tne magnetic field in the automatic measurement made. On discontinuous
variations of the magnetic field. their magnitude is limited by the width
of the nutation line. In the automatic operating node. the above-described
zero measurement aethod is used, and the operation of the magnetometer
takes place on one of the sections of the nutation line to the left of
point a (see Pig 4. a). Per variations with respect to magnitude greater
than A! (Pig G, a) and positive with respect to sign. the operating point
of the sagnetometer can be shifted beyond the point A. and the entire
closed system falls into the unstable operating zone. for a positive feed-
back arises. The expansion of the zone of stable operations of the track-
ing system of the msgnetoseter can be achieved by two procedures.

by the first procedure. the broadening of the zone of stable operation of
the magneto-eter can be realised as a result of expansion of the nutation

but shifting them closer to the edge of the magnet hole. it is possible

to achieve the situation such that the conditions of nuclear magnetic
resonance will be satisfied for each sensor on its own frequency. In our
case in this way it was possible to expand the tone of stable operations

of the magnetometer from +0.5 oersteds (for a single sensor) to +10 oarsteds.
Pig a. a shows the boundary of the expended tone by a dotted line.

by the second procedure the sons of stable operation of the magnetometer
can be expanded in practice without limit by using the characteristic

Thus. a magnetometer was developed for automatic measurement of the
variations of the nonuniform magnetic field in the small gaps. for a
relative gradient of 5°10’3 cm' . the measurement accuracy was 5-10"

in the static mode and 10" for the harmonic variations with «1.5 deg/sec.
The range of measured variations of the magnetic field was 112 of
slunmoo oersteds. which was connected only with the limited range of
frequency tuning of the measuring generator. further decrease in the
error is possible as a result of using the units with more stable
characteristics which. first of all. pertains to the measuring generator.

NAIURAL OSCILLATIONS OF A CYLINDRICAL RESONATOR PARTIALLY FILLED HIT“
ANISOTROPIC DIBLBCTRIC

(Article by Yu. I. Heshcheryakov. l. N. Toptysin]

[Text] The problea of deterninina the natural frequencies of resonators
partially filled with anisotropic dielectric is encountered in plasma
physics when calculating quantum ssplitiers and generators and also a
nuabar of nicrowave devices in which it is necessary to insure vacuum
therasl insulation between the dielectric and the walls of the resonator.
The coaplate solution of the problems for all-possible types of oscillations
and the high degree of anisotropy of the dielectric is highly cospliceted.
however. in the case of low anisotropy this problen can be solved by the
eathods of perturbation theory.

As the undisturbed systel it is natural to select a resonator in which the
anisotropic dielectric (uniaxial crystal having dielectric constants tl'
end cl} is replaced by an isotropic dielectric with the dielectric

constant ‘0.‘lf Then the perturbation parameter for the cospletely filled

resonator will be (ell-tIRItl . end for partial filling this pareseter

decreases naturally. For a ruby which is used in quantua asplifiers and
generators (cle9.95. tll-ll.73). the perturbation paraseter is 0.18.

Thus. the problea of calculating the natural frequencies is broken down

into two parts: calculation of the natural frequencies of the resonator
partially filled with isotropic dielectrics; datersination of the corrections
for anisotropy.

we shall consider that the cylindrical ruby red is coaxial to the resonator.
and the axis of anisotropy of the ruby is perpendicular to the axis of
sy-setry of the systen. Let us first consider the TB oscillations in

the undisturbed systaa. For thee B‘-0. and a: is determined free the solution

The boundary conditions for the field components are

From those conditions, it is necessary to determine the constants c and D
and also the natural frequencies. It is easy to see that the factually
asynmetric solutions (mic) do not satisfy the boundary conditions (2)

if the resonator is incompletely filled with dielectric. In this case.
there are no individual TB and TH oscillatiOns in the investigated system;
some of their superpositions are characteristic types. For the axially
symmetric oscillations (m-O) the set of boundary conditions gives the
following transcendental equation for determining the natural frequencies:

natural frequencies (Ju'(x1a)-0 for any n. The analogous equations occur
for oscillations of.the TM type. One of the families of curves obtained
by the numerical solution of equation (6) for the lowest TB type
(co-9.95. p-l, a-O. 2a-1.2-10' m) is presented in Pig 1.

Now let us proceed to the calculation of the corrections to the natural

frequencies caused by anisotropy of the dielectric. Let us present only

[Text] At the present time the electromagnetic decelerating atructurea
are finding broader and broader application in the development of aicro-
wave eleaenta auch ea delay linea. phaae ahiftere. traveling wave filtera

Analytical and Nuaerical Calculationa of the Decelerating Structure in
the h-Type Uevn Guide

In the traveling wave aaaere, the ladder type decelerating atructure
uaually ia placed in the wave guide together with the active material

for which ruby ia aoat frequently uaed (c-lO). The application at a

wave guide with rectangular croaa aection doea not lake it poaaible to
create an optiael atructural deaign of the naaer. for the deceleration
coefficient turna out to be anall. and the uae coefficient of the active
laterial turna out to be low. he the calculation rfornad below indicataa.
the application of the 'ﬂ-type wave guide ia more n;oapective. Thia wave
guide and alao the other coaplex for-a of wave guidea with a ladder baffle
were inveatigated by Butcher [1]. who wee limited to the caee of the
obaence of a dielectric. However. inasmuch an the dielectric conatant

of the aaeer cryatala ia high. the partial filling of the wave guide with

the dielectric eaaentially changea ita propertiee. and in real caaea the
Butcher rcaulta are inapplicable.

Let ua conaider the wave guide, the ahape of the croae aection of which ia
depicted in Fig l. The dielectric will be conaidered isotropic, the
ladder baffle ia in the plane of y-O. the planea are oriented parallel

to the x-axia. Inaaauch ea in real caaea the wave length ia large by
coapnriaon with the ayatea period, we ahall aolve the proble- in the
approxi-ation of an aniaotropically conducting plane. Let ua firat find
the partial aolutiona of the Maxwell equationa for the region

Decelerating Structure of the Meander Type .

A distinguishing feature of the transmitting line of the meander type is
the fact that the group propagation rate of the oscillations in it turns
out to be nuch smaller than for the purely geometric deceleration. and at
the same time this rate bends weekly on the frequency in a sufficiently

broad frequency band. This makes it highly prospective to use the meander
line in many electronic devices.

Let us consider the structure of thc meander type which is located in a
vacuum (Pig 2). it is convenient to use a rectangular coordinate system.
The thickness of the strips 6 in the direction of the y-axis is assumed
to be negligibly small so that the structure can be considered plane and

located in the as plane. Let us first perform the calculation under the
assumption of infinite conductivity of the strips.

Inasmuch as a meander is an infinitely long periodic structure with the
period tea+b. at the corresponding pointsof the structure removed from

each other by the period. the elecromagnetic field can be distinguished
only by the phase factor

Just as in the paper by butcher [l] in which a study was made of a strip

equations in the form of the TIM waves. The absence of the TH and TE type
waves is connected with the proposed smallness of the ratio alas the

presence. for example. of the component 3 do would cause disturbance of
the boundary conditions for the tangential component of the electric

THEORETICAL STUDY 0? IRS LINE SHIFT OF The SUPBRPINB STRUCTURE OF RYDROGBN
AJOHS IN A "BLIUH AIHOSPHBRB

[Article by Vl. V. astygin. N. A. Lepuk. B. c. Hetisov]

[Text] Recently the line shift of the superfine structure of hydrogen
etoss in en atnoephere of inert gee has turned out to be en object of
broad exporinentel [1-2] end theoretical [6-8] interest. The recent
experieentel progress took the fore of neasuring the euperfine shift in s
broad tenpereture range [3]; st the sees tine more date eppeered which
were subject to explenetion by the theory.

In the proposed paper the exchange perturbetion theory nethod is applied
to the celculstion of spin densities on the nucleus of e hydrogen etc. at
e finite distsnce iron the heliun etoe. The exact celculetion of the spin
densities is the lost complex probles in theoreticsl investigations of

the superfine shift end brosdening (see [6], [8]).

An electron of the hydrogen eton in the nornal stste has an orbital eo-ent
of 1-0; therefore the hsniltonien of the electron-nuclear interaction leading
to superfine splitting is described with good precision by the Per-i con-
tact intersction.

The locsl shift of the eta-dc level caused by the spproech of the buffer
eton to it by dietsnce R is defined so

‘.(R.)-O(R)—O.-mﬂ59(k). (I)

Here w(R) is the spacing between levels of the superfine etructure

Formula (2) is accurate to second order inclusively with respect to the

In order to calculate the local shift it is necessary to know the wave
function of the H-He system for finite distances between the hydrogen
and helium nuclei. For this purpose we shall use one of the most
developed versions of the exchange perturbation theory taking into
account the Pauli principle -- the ALBAX exchange perturbation theory
[10]. He do not want to deal with the difficulties connected with

ambiguity of the expansions of the exchange perturbation theory here
(see. for exasple. [11]).

On the basis of the formslisa'developed in [10]; let us write the wave
function and the energy of the ground state (22 ) of the H-Be system with

accuracy to the second order of ssallness with respect to the perturbation

In formulas (6) and (7) the terms of order exp (-2ZR) and less are
omitted (1-1.6875).

A careful analysis of formula (2) indicates that a significant contribution
to the local shift 6o(R) is sade only by the first four terns. The first
two terms are the overlap integrals. The wave function of the ground

state of the helium atom will be approximated by the product of two single-
electron wave functions in the approximation of the effective charge

for which there is a simple formula (see. for example. [123. the appendix):
’0 " (¢.(|)l¢’.(2)) " 8’.

It is obviOua that the first term of (2) depends only on the zero-approxima-
tion wave functions and. consequently. does not depend on the choice of

the version of the relative perturbation theory. All of the remaining

terms (2) are sensitive to the choice of the version of the relative
perturbation theory.

The second tern of (2) includes the value of q determined according to (3)

The exact calculation of the sum (10) is extraordinarily difficult for
two reasons: a) it is necessary to know all of the eigenfunctions for
the helium ates: b) ”k0 is the matrix element of the exchange time con-
taining highly complex molecular integrals -- the electron exchange and
the hybrid integrals in the arbitrary excited state. including the
continuous spectrum.

Therefore. in order to estimate (10) we shall use the known Unsold pro-
cedure consisting in taking some average value of (Bo-5hrz outside the

The sun (12) contains the exchange type matrix elements: therefore (see
the shove) we also used the Unsaid procedure for calculation of it. how-
ever. the characteristic difficulty is encountered here -- the product
6(r“)V(2) arises. It is an operator which is defined improperly. for it

contains the term 6(r.1)/r.1 which is aesningless. Accordingly. the tar-

"l'el with the "dangerous" deneeinator ra1-0 must be isolated and

investigated accurately without applying the Unsaid averaging to it.

The first term together with the fourth (in the fourth tern it is sufficient
to limit ourselves to wave functions in the agro approximation) gives the
local shift in the aero approximation of 6o<° (R).

Let us write the final expression for the local relative shift of the
line of the superfine structure of the hydrogen atom:

The averaging parameter 1' is estimated free a comparison of the numerical
values for the spectral sums which are calculated exactly and the application
of the Unsold procedure.

The summation in (13) also ieplies integration over a continuous spectrum
of the hydrogen atom. A detailed calculation of these sums can be found

in [7. report lV]. It is necessary to note that when calculating

xh, (I!) we were actually able for the first time to perform the integration
over the continuous spectrum.

Formula (13) which we obtained for the local shift has quite understandable
physical meaning in contrast to the results of [6. 8]. The first term of

an (R) in (13) was reckoned for the first time in the work by Clark 15].
he did not obtain the other terms inasmuch as he was limited to the ane
function in the sore approximation. This led to the fact that his theoreti-
cal result for the shift differed free the experimental result by two times.

The first tern (the Van der Heals type) was present already in Adrian's
work [6]: no for the remaining terms. they occur as a result of the appli-
cation of the more successive method of relative perturbation theory.

He also used another method of calculating 6u(R) (in the first order)

As is obvious froe Table l. the primary contribution to the local shift

at internediate ietances R~A to 6 atomic units is ends by the local shift
of zero order 6» 0)(II) and the exchange tern 92. The nonexchange sun a1
is negative for all R and is about 251 of the shift du(R). A coeperieon
of the local shifts obtained by Devison and Lisa, Dee and Ray and by us
indicates that our 6u(k) is closer to the shift free [6]. but in contrast

to it has small negative part. The local shift free [8] has the ease
property.

It is necessary to nete that the accurate calculation of the nonexchange
sun and also one of the exchange suns and nsinly with the "dangerous"

denosinator r;{ demonstrated that at intermediate distances the discrete

spectrum sakes e S to 10-fold nore'significant contribution than the
continuous spectrun which to some degree justifies the application of the
Unsold averaging in the other suns. In the sums with respect to discrete
spectrum. in turn. the primary contribution is usually made by the first
tern (n-Z). For example, in the sun 01 for 8-5 to 6 the contribution of
the first tern is 80 to 902. Thus, our calculations confirm the neglecting
of the higher excited states in other papers (apparently. we succeeded for
the first tine in correctly considering the contribution froe the higher
excited states. including froe the continuous spectrun). According to
fur-«Ins (I). (ll) presented in reference [9]. the observed (averaged
over the distances R) relative shift fp-A/(puo) was calculated. where

TNSORY OP LINE SHIFTS AND IROADBNINOS OF THE SUPBRPINB TRANSITION OF AN
ATOM IN A SUPPER GAS BNVIRONHBNT

[Vl. V. Iatygin. Vit. V. latygin. Yu. 0. Gushva. A. N. lvanov]

[Text] The phenoaena of line shift and broadening of the superfine
transition of stoss in a buffer gas anvironeent have been quite deeply
and completely investigated in the papers with double optical resonance
of alkali atoas and in creating frequency standards on the principle of
optical punping. The theoretical studies are less coaplete. Several
papers are known which are devoted to the calculation of the collision
shift of the frequency, for exasple. [l-S]. however. the line width was
not calculated in any of then. The purpose of this paper is to fill this
gap to sole extent - to obtain calculation expressions for the line shifts
and broadenings of the superfine structure with zero intensity of the
punping field and the aicrowave field.

At the present tile in all the known papers [1-5] for calculation of the
collision shift of the line frequency of the superfine transition of an

active alkali or hydrogen ateo in a buffer gas. the following formula is
used:

a—N,j:exp(-£gl-) hi’O'kk’dR. U)
""°" J-(R)-~(R)--.; (2)

”n is the frequency of thc superfine transition of the isolated active
atom: Au(R) is the local shift of the frequency occurring on fastening

the atom of buffer gas at a distance R from the active atom a( 5u(')):
N3 is the concentration of the buffer ate-s; 0(8) is the energy :9
interaction of the active and buffer atone: T is the gas temperature;

k is the Boltzmann constant. Formula (1) can be written on the basis of
the obvious statistical argulents which. however. will not peruit anything
to be said about the line width (neither about collision or doppler
width) and the width was not calculated in any of the papers (1-5].

General espruuuione for the shifts and broadeninge have been found in
correlation theory; see. for example. [6. 7]. However. it was not possible
with their help to achieve agreement with the experiment for the line

shift in contrast to formula (1). The fact that for collision broadening
rcoll values were obtained which exceed the observed ones by several

orders. was especially inconvenient. Prom correlation theory the conclu-
sion would be drawn that the foley ratio must be satisfied to]:

rcoll Isl .1. (3)

Nevertheless. from the experiment it follows that in the microwave band

at pressures of less than 100 torr the collision broadening is less by
several orders than the shift. and expression (3) is thus grossly violated.
we investigated this problem in 1969-1973 [9. 10]. The reason for such
significant constriction of the lines is the random wanderings of the
phase of the emitted field in accordance with the previously stated quali-
tative arguments [ll]. In order to obtain the calculation formulas for
the shift and broadening. it turned out to be necessary to consider the
distortion of the trajectories of the colliding atoms.

Basic Propositions

In the estimates discussed below we shall take the values of the parameters
that are standard for the gas cells of atomic frequency standards with

optical pumping. for example. [11]. The derived formulas indeed have
broader applicability.

For these values of the parameters the following theoretical propositions
are satisfied: '

l) The primary role is played by short binary collisions of the active
atom with the buffered ones - the impact approximation ro>>tc°113

2) The relative motion of the active and buffer atoms is quasiclassical
so that it is possible to talk about the classical theory. the target
parameters 0. and so on;

3) The condition l>>L of the Dicke effect ia satisfied;

6) The energy of the superfine interaction is small so that dw(R)tcoll

S) The adiabatic collision broadening is large by comparison with non-

It is significant that the forsula (13) has a reasonable structure of

The general behavior of the factors oxp(-U/kT) and F exp (-U/kT) is

with respect to (l) and with respect to (13) must be close (see below).
differing by no more than 10 to 201. Here formula (13) usually gives s

where 0 is the probability integral. Usually F1(x) for all x is quite
close to i. In order to obtain (15). in the initial expression (11) it
is necessary to introduce the average velocity v under the integral sign
with respect to v and replace it by the variable velocity v.

Let us note that the approximation of rectilinear trajectories [6]. [7]

is unsuitable in the case of lines with superfine structure. for it

erodes the basic fact of smallness of the phase a in a significant region R
(for sore details see [9]).

When calculating the adiabatic broadening in general fore it is necessary
to perfora only integration with respect to 9. Introducing the notation

supplemented for a number of temperatures by our results. The results of
the calculation and the experiments agree on the whole satisfactorily.
The difference between formulae (1) and (13) is 8-131. In all cases the
form factor decreases the value of the shift. For the H-He system with

The results of the calculations of the adiabatic broadening by formula (16)
are presented in Tables 2 and 3. The calculations were performed for the
same versions as above. The absolute values of the adiabatic broadening
are presented in Table 2. and its relative values of -r /(u p) in Table 3
along with the values of the ratio of the adiabatic broaden ng to shear
and the absolute transition frequency.

It is impossible to compare the values obtained for T, with the experiment
at the present time. for they are small and are completely shaded out by
the stronger broadening effects.

For the relaxation croaa section a we were able to obtain the closed formula
considering the diatortione of the trajectory which we shall not present

in view of the insufficient space (see [9. 10]). This gornula was used to
calculate the inelastic collision cross section o-r [(vN ) for certain

A-a pairs. The results are partially presented in able 2. They are
compared with the e perinatal [16. 15] and theoretical results [16].

Obviously. it is possible to talk about the existence of agreement between
the theory and the experiment. Our for-ole predicts a sharp increase in
cross section at low temperatures. This temperature range still has not
been investigated experimentally.
