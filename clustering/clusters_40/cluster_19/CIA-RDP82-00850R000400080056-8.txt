[Text] Abstract: The results of the most significant theoretical and
experimental studies of a new area of modern ship hydrodynamics,
which is of practical importance and is related to modern methods
of the theory and calculation of a controlled boundary layer, are
discussed in this unnograph. Along with theoretical problems,
physical models of the investigated phenomena are considered,
experimental data and structural diagrams of various methods of
boundary layer control are analyzed. Results are presented from
studying fluid flow stability in a laminar boundary layer, vari-
ous methods of laminarisation (suction, flexible surfaces and
coverings that alter the properties of the fluid), and turbulent
boundary layer control by injecting materials with various proper-
ties into the region next to the wall. Practical recommendations
are made which will permit the possibilities of one control
method or another to be evaluated, and conclusions are drawn re-
garding the expediency of using boundary layer control for vis-
cous drag reduction on ships.

The book is designed for engineering, scientific workers, post-
graduates and students in the higher courses of the shipbuilding
schools and departments.

There are 092 pages, 205 figures, 10 tables and 391 references.

PREFACE BY THE WIS

At this tine applied hydrodynsaics has developed to the point that it is possible not
only to detersine the forces acting on a body in notion. but also to alter the direc-
tion of these forces in the direction required in practice. However, whereas there
are a umber of nonographs on wave drag on a loving body in which neth of deter-
mination and reduction of wave drag are presented. the problena of determining
viscous drag are discussed in only individual journal articles. which for the lost
part are unavailable and unknown to shipbuilders at large.

This situation is explained by the novelty of the problss and absence of a clear
idea about the practical possibilities of one nethod or another of reducing viscous
drag.

The nonograph presented here is intended to fill this gap to sons degree. It dis-
cusses boundary layer control nethods and calculation procedures penitting estima-
tion of the possibilities of one control Isthod or another. Conclusions are drawn

regarding expediency of boundary layer control to “hie“ Viscous drﬂs NdVCtioﬂa

Boundary layer control can theoretically be inplelented by two nethods. The first
consists in injecting nsterials the properties of which differ fro. the

properties of water at the wall region. The second is based on the idea of lamina-
rization of the boundary layer ; with large lleynolds nutters the friction in the
boundary layer under laminar conditions is less than in a turbulent boundary layer.

Both of the indicated nethods are investigated in the book. when discussing the
first of then. problems are investigated which are connected with studying a bound-
ary layer both with continuous distribution of the fluid properties across the
boundary layer and in the presence of an interface between fluids (an air or gas
interlayer between the surface over which flow takes place and the nain water flow).

The problens of stability of the fluid flow in a laminar boundary layer and various

nethods of laninaritation of the boundary layer (suction. flexible coveringa,altara—
tion of the fluid properties in the wall region) were investigated in the discussion

of the second nethod.

Structural diagrams are presented for various methods of boundary layer control.

Reynolds number. Therefore the boundary layer characteristics of a nodel and
full scale unit can differ significantly, which. in turn, can lead to noticeable
variation of the force interaction of a body with a fluid and complicates the pro—
cess of recalculating the results of model experiments to full scale. Under full
scale conditions the Reynolds nunbers are appreciably higher than during nodel
experiments. The boundary layer of full-scale units in practice is coupletely tur-
bulent. 0n the basis of relative snallness of the Reynolds ushers, in the case of
nodels the boundary layer can rmin laninar at significant distances free the for-
ward end, and. consequently, the possibility of laninar separation arises. In
addition, under laminar flow conditions the frictional drag is appreciably lees
than under turbulent conditions. Accordingly, the people conducting experiments

are faced with the problem of turbuliration of the boundary layer which is solved
by various types of turbulence stimulators.

The turbulization problen also arises the simulating liftitg surfaces if the experi-
nent is performed with snall Reynolds numbers.

For illustration of the effect of the nature of the flow in the boundary layer on
the hydrodynamic properties of lifting surfaces let us consider the results of one
of the experiments perforned by G. G. Pilippchenko and G. V. Anderson. A foil having
Ham-2309 section. with 0.5 neter chord and I later span was moved at a speed of

9.5 n/sec in a stationary air environment. The lift was measured, and the flow
separation on the suction face of the foil was recorded by Ileana of silk threads
glued to it. A photograph of the upper surface of a foil set at an angle of attack
of 18° is presented in Figure 0.1. The behavior of the silk threads indicatd sepa~
ration of the boundary layer over the greater part of the surface. The lift (6,)
was 0.8 in this case. Figure 0.2 shows the behavior of the silk threads in the
presence of a trip wire 1 In in diameter positioned with respect tothe foil in
accordance with the diagram illustrated in Figure 0.3. Judging by the silk threads,
boundary layer separation is in practice absent over the entire foil although the
towing speed and position of the foil with respect to the flow did not change. In
the investigated case the lift was 1.15. Boundary layer separation is eliminated by

turbulization exactly as in Prandtl's well-known experiment with flow over a
sphere.

3. The next important area of application of boundary layer control is the class of
problems connected with decreasing drag. Out of the three coeponents of water re-
sistance to the movement of vessels — wave drag, fora drag and frictional drag —
first form drag began to be decreased by giving streamlined, smooth lines to bodiesr
moving in a fluid. it is also possible to reduce frictional drag by de-
creasing the wetted surface. In this case the bodies becone relatively short and
the form drag increases sharply as a result of flow separations occurring in the

aft end. Suction or ventilation of the bomderylayerin .thevicinity of the aft end

is proposed to eliminate the indicated separations.

lo. The problems of influencing frictional drag have been the least studied. In
practice, shipbuilding has no fully developed nethods of reducing frictional drag.
They are all in various stages of testing and deteraination of the expediency of
their application.

It is the goal of the authors to outline to none degree the class of basic netth

of lowering frictional drag which appear to be theoretically possible. These nethods
have been visually represented in diagram 2. The degree to which individual nethods

of lowering frictional drag have been developed differs. The most prospective and
efficient means is ventilation of the wall region with gases. This follows from a
comparison of the frictional stresses on the wall in fluids with different physical

constants. Therefore the method of reducing frictiOnal drag by creating thin air
films, which has been checked out under full-scale conditions, is the closest to

practical application. Although suction of the boundary layer to achieve laminati-
zstion has shown its best side in aviation. it is premature to recounand this

method for practical use in shipbuilding. for there are no corresponding data from
full-scale experiments.

The method of reducing drag by using flexible surfaces is the farthest from practical
application. This method has been confirmed by a single experiment and theoretical
developments.

Along with the indicated methods the classification presented in diagram 2 encom-
passes methods which have as their "assets" only theoretical developments (laminati-
zation of the boundary layer by creating a positive kinematic viscosity gradient in
the well region). Finally, methods of lowering the frictional drag are mentioned
there. the idea behind which has still be insufficiently completely confirmed by
theoretical developments and experiments (for example. the effect of an elastic wall
on a turbulent boundary layer).

when studying diagram 2 it is necessary to consider the known degree of arbitrari-
ness in dividing laminarization methods into methods that increase the curvature of
the velocity profile and methods directly influencing pulsating motion in the boun-
dsry layer. The presented classification wee constructed by the principle of con-
sidering the primary mechanism of controlling disturbing motion. Thus, with auction.
for example. not only is the steepness of the velocity profile increased, but the
centers of pulsating motion are eliminated together with the fluid; in the case of
decreasing the kinematic viscosity near the well. the profile fills out signifio
cantly. but the pulsating motion damps more slowly.

Not all methods of reducing drag presented in diagram 2 are analysed in the book.
Only the moat prospective in the sense of use for shipbuilding are touched on.
Primary attention has been given to discussing new results and investigating the
theoretical aspects of applying one method or another.

The apparatus of stability theory is used for theoretical evaluation of the possi-
bility of boundary layer laminarieation. This approach sometimes encounters objec-
tions in connection with the fact that there is a transition region between the
point of loss of stability defined by this theory and the developed turbulent boun-
dary layer zone. This transition region can also change in its extent. Therefore
the following remarks are appropriate.

Hydrodynamic stability theory has been confirmed by many experiments (see Chapter I)
and correctly indicates the basic trend in the occurrence of turbulence. Based on
the conclusions of stability theory, laminarired foil sections were built which un-
der actual conditions demonstrated theoretically predicted better drag character-
istics than ordinary sections (Figure 0.6).

This qualitative agreement between the stability theory conclusions and full-scale
experimentation is also observed in boundary layer laminariaation by auction of
fluid froa the surface over which flow is taking place.

Thus, the application of hydrodynamic stability theory for qualitative evaluation of
the possibilities of one method of boundary layer laminarisation or another appears

to be justified. the more so in that calculations perforned with respect to the loss
of stability point always give a "margin" in determining the length of the laminar
section (of course. if all of the significant factors of the phenomenon are taken
into account).

Laminarization of a boundary layer requires elimination of quite powerful disturbing
factors: surface vibration and roughness, extraordinary external turbulence, local
boundary layer separations. The effect of some of the indicated factors on transi-
tion of laminar flow to turbulent is discussed in Chapter V.

Hydrodynamic stability theory studies the behavior of smell disturbances in a lami-

nar boundary layer. It is obviously impossible exactly to define the boundary
which separates small disturbances from finite ones at this time. It is necessary

to define the adnisaible magnitude of the above-enumerated disturbances in each
specific case on the basis of experimental data.

It has been pointed out that the most prospective means of reducing the frictional
drag of flat-bottomed transport vessels is ventilation of the wall region of the
flow with low-viscosity and lowvdensity materials, that is, gases.

Accordingly, a theoretical study of a two-phase boundary layer is presented in the
book.

Two boundary layer gas saturation modes are investigated: the film mode in which a
clearly expressed. stable gas-liquid interface is observed, and the diffusion or
bubble mode in which a gas—water mixture moves near the wall, the viscosity and
density of which exceed the viscosity and density of the gas.

From the point of view of decreasing frictional drag the film gas saturation mode
is of the greatest interest.

As a result of complexity of studying a two-phase boundary layer. the phase motion
diagram is given. that is, the gas saturation mode (film or bubble) and the mode of
motion of the liquid and gas (laminar or turbulent) are assumed in advance. This
approach makes it possible to determine all of the hydrodynamic flow parameters.
The problems of stability of the assumed form of the flow are not considered.

In view of significant difference in physical characteristics of a gas and a liquid

two different methods of theoretical investigation of film gas saturation are pre-
sented in the book.

On the one hand, boundary layer theory is used to study film gas saturation consid-
ering the effect of the gas density and viscosity under the condition of neglecting
the influence of the gas ventilation on the pressure distribution which is assumed
to be given. The form of the interface is deter-ined by the gas flow rate and
method of injecting it into the flow.

0n the other hand, for investigation of artificially created gas films the theory

of developed cavitating flow is used in which real gas properties are not considered.
Motion with an interface is considered as motion of an ideal fluid defined by the
cavitation and Froude numbers with a free flow line subject to determination. the
pressure on which is constant and equal to the gas pressure in the film.

Here a study is made of the problem of the limits of applicability of the indicated
theories important in scientific and practical respects.

The efficient use of cavitating gas films to reduce drag is possible only if the
basic physical laws defining the cavitating flow parameters are known.

In the proposed book a quite detailed discussion is presented of the results of
theoretical and experimental studies determining the parameters of artificial gas
films created on the bottom. The most important results of these studies was the
conclusion of the existence of a limiting Proude number with respect to length of
the gas film or. what amounts to the same thing, with given speed of the vessel -
limiting (maximum possible) length of the gas film. In addition, it is demonstra-
ted that limiting gas films can be obtained for very small (theoretically zero) air
flow rates, and the cavitation drag of the fittings used to form the gas films is
very small.

The results presented in Chapter VIII can be used for practical solution of problems

connected with the development of drag reduction devices for flat-bottoned
transport vessels and planing vessels. '

In the Soviet Union. papers by a number of researchers consider the problem connec-
ted with inconpressible boundary layer control.

CHAPTER I. LAHINAR BOUNDARY LAYER STABILITY

§ Ll. Sane General Problens of the Stability of the Laminar Form of Fluid hotion

During fluid flow two fem of notion can be observed in the boundary layer: lami-
nar and turbulent. The laminar forn of motion of the fluid (from the latin word
lamina — plate) is characterized by the fact that its elenents move in an orderly
fashion. in layers, not mixing with adjacent layers. The turbulent form of fluid
notion (free the latin oord turbulentus - storey, disordered) is characterized by
disordered, nonsteady displacements of its elements along conplex trajectories.

here the fluid particle velocities are of e rendos nature and vary with high fre—
quency.

It must be emphasized that the presence of dieorderliness in the notion of fluid
particles only in tine is insufficient for the motion to be considered turbulent [1].

Actually. .one can conceive of defined quantity of fluid moving randomly as a
solid body in space.

In exactly the sane way, it is insufficient to have disorderlineas of motion of

the fluid particles only in space, for it is possible to imagine steady notion of
a fluid with disorderly trajectories in any volune.

As an example, let us consider the flow behind a circular cylinder [2]. For snail
Reynolds numbers (Figure 1.1a) the flow in the wake is of a laninar nature. with an
increase in the flow velocity around the cylinder (Figure l.lb-d) s Karnn vortex
sheet forms behind the cylinder which, in spite of a quite complex nonateedy state
law of development in tine and space. cannot be classified as turbulent notion be-
cause of the absence of dieorderlineas of the displacements of the fluid elaents.
Hith a further growth of the flow velocity around the cylinder. the motion in the

wake acquires a turbulent nature. An analogous picture of the laminar to turbulent
flow transition is observed between coaxial cylinders [3].

It is possible to obtain a representation of the nature of velocity pulsations in
the laminar, transition and turbulent regions of the boundary layer fron investiga-
tion of none oecillograns (Figure 1.2e-c) obtained by V. Di. Nikolayeva and II. A.

Sergiyevskiy during wind tunnel testing of a nodal of a wing using a tharnoanemo-
metric device.

The existence of two fluid flow conditions naturally inposea the problen of the con-
ditions causing transition of one type of flow into the other. In practical lpplir
cations usually we are dealing with transition of laminary flow into turbulent. in

connection with which the primary attention of hydro and aeromechanics specialists
is directed toward the discovery and study of the stability conditions of laminar
fluid flow, the conditions of sustaining it [b]. However. recently problems have
been discovered in which it was necessary for researchers to deal with transition of
a turbulent flow to laminar [SI-[9]. A discussion is presented below of the prob—
lems connected only with the laminar-turbulent transition. The phenomenon of lasi-
nar to turbulent transition is highly complex. Thus. for example. for the case of
fluid flow in a boundary layer the following regions are distinguished in the tran-
aition zone free the laminar boundary layer to a developed turbulent boundary layer
[10]. The beginning of the first region (Figure 1.3) is determined by the point of
loss of stability of the laminar boundary layer with respect to small tendon dis-
turbances incident in the boundary layer. As the experiments of Schubauer and
Skrasstad [11] demonstrated, relatively regular oscillations of the laminar flow can
and do exist in this zone. These oscillations. developing downstreanv increase with
respect to amplitude and. acquiring an irregular nature, make the transition to the
next region characterized by the presence of turbulent "spots" [6]. Increasing in
size. the turbulent spots gradually fill the entire wall space. forming a turbulent
boundary layer. Oscillograms of the recordings of velocity pulsations in the tran-
sition zone obtained by N. A. Sergiyevskiy using a thsrnosnenometer when testing
plates in a Iodel testing basin are presented in Figure 1.6.

At the present time only the conditions of occurrence of the first region, that is.
the conditions of stability of a laminar boundary layer with respect to small dis-
turbances [12] have been sufficiently completely studied as applied to the boundary
layer.

From what has been stated it follows that the state of the art in determining loss of stability

in a boundary layer does not offer the possibility of indicating the beginning of
developed turbulent flow in the layer, for the characteristics of the second

fron the point of View of their transition to the turbulent state. On the basis of

the conclusions of stability theory [Bl-(15], lasinsriaed foil sections have been
built which denonstrate better drag characteristics than ordinary sections [16].

Stability theory has also predicted [17], [18] significant possibilities of laninari-
zation of bodies by auction of fluid out of the boundary layer. As an sample. in

Figure 1.5 we see the results of deternining the transition point by e that-canno-
metric device on a perforated {on with and without suction of air across its sur-

face (the experiment was perforned by V. a. Nikoleysva). By the transition point in

the indicated experiment she neant the point of antinu- intensity of the velocity
pulsations recorded by the instrlment.

In connection with an investigation of the transition zone it suat be noted that the
loss of stability of the initial laminar form of flow in a boundary layer need not
i-ediately cause turbuliration. It can be fond that the flow converts to another
laminar fora more stable than the initial one [19]. [20]. An analogous phenonenon

occurs in the wake behind a cylinder (see Figure 1.1) when a rectilinear laninar
flow sakes the transition to an oscillatory flov uhich, in turn, develops into a

Karnan vortex sheet which is a note stable tern of lasinar notion than the initial
fora. The transition of one laninar fore of fluid notion into another can be

observed also in experiments with rotating coaxial cylinders [3]. [21]. when the

laminar flow in the gap between cylinders becosss proper vortex notion (so-called
"Taylor vortices").

Among researchers studying the problem of transition in a boundary layer there are
two points of View with regard to its nature. Certain researchers (Taylor [22],

in the boundary layer. Others (Tollmien [26]. Schlichting [6], Lin [12]) explain
transition as a consequence of loss of stability of the laminar boundary layer with
respect to small random disturbances. Experiments performed under the corresponding
conditions [ll], (25], [26] and [27] confirn both theories. In reality, obviously
the situation is such that in the presence of quite large disturbances transition
takes place by a scheme close to the Taylor scheme, and for relatively small dis-
turbances, phenomena develop as predicted by Tollmienuschlichting theory.

At this time the Tollmien-Schlichting stability theory based on the classical method
of small disturbances is considered generally accepted. This theory is VB?!
strictly substantiated and confirmed by many experiments. As will be obvious from
what follows, it gives a picture of the development of smell random disturbances in
a laminar boundary layer which is quite close to reality.

when studying different methods of boundary layer lasinarisation. which will be dis-
cussed later, it is necessary to have a method of estimating the degree of stability
of the laminar form of flow under various conditions. The method of small oscilla-
tions, a systematic discussion of which is presented in the following sections. was
selected as this apparatus. Before proceeding with a description of this method,

it is necessary to indicate its place among the existing methods of calculating
stability: the Goertler method and the energy method. A brief description of the
mentioned methods and their areas of application are considered below.

The above-described systens of equations of notion of a viscous fluid are basic when
studying flow over bodies in cases where the forces of inertia in the flow greatly
exceed the viscosity forces everywhere except the thin well region where the indi-
cated categories of forces are conparable with respect to nagnitude. The Prandtl
equations describing the notion of a fluid in this region called the boundary layer
with good approximation, can be obtained by different nethods [29]. [321-[35].

In order to study the flow in a boundary layer it is expedient to introduce the scale

It is natural that the scale selected in this way lust he related to the Reynolds

it is possible to reduce the problem of integration of tha systea (1.18) to finding

the function u(x. y. t). Naturally the boundary and the initial conditions in this
case will he set only for the function u(x, y, t) and its derivatives. As follows

from (1.19). the function v(x, 0, t) which also mat be given. constitutes an excep-
tion.

The main boundary conditions for the system (1.18) which fully determine the flow
picture are the following expressions

«(1. 0. I)= Hit. 1); 0(x. 0. !)=I.lx. I);
«(1. y. 0],... » (HI. I). (1.20)

The last of the conditions (1.20) is defined insufficiently clearly. for the bmnadary
layer region smoothly becones the external potential flow region. In addition, it

is necessary to remember that the Prandtl equations are valid only near the surface
over which flow takes place. However. the use of this condition does not lead to
any dif f iculties, for the equations themselves are such that even for finite and
quite small values of y the velocity in the boundary layer in practice becomes equal
to the velocity of the potential flow.

In the case of nonsteady notion in the investigated region it is necessary to give
the function

“(1-, y, 0) ... /,(.\. g). (1.21)

For practical solution of the problem of a nonateady boundary layer, instead of the
condition (1.21), the velocity of the body at the time t - O and lav of subseqmt
variation of this velocity are given. If the initial velocity of the body “0 1‘ 0.
then it in necessary to indicate how the body reaches this velocity; otherwise the

problem will be incowletely fornulated. for the function f3 in equality (1.21) will
not he defined.

Approximate methods of integrating the systen (1.18), for example, the neth based
on using the Karman integral relation, replace the problen of finding one function
u(x. y, t) by the problem of defining several. but simpler functions with respect to

structure. It is natural that to find these functions more boundary and initial
conditions are required. These additional boundary conditions for the case of

steady-state flow include the Kamn- Pdilhatnen condition consisting in the assumption
of validity of the first equation of motion at the wall and also the expressions ob-
tained by differentation of it with respect to the transverse coordinate. At the
outer boundary of the boundary layer the conditions of snootlmess of conjugacy of

the velocity profile in the layer with the external flow velocity are used. equating
the derivatives of the function u(x. y) with respect to the coordinate y to zero.

layer. Thus. the problen of the boundary layer in an inconpressible fluid on a body
of rotation can always be reduced to the problen of the boundary layer of a flat
outline with corresponding velocity distribution in the potential external flou.

Equation of Disturbing Motion. when studying the stability of the laninsry fora of

Stability of a flow described by equations (1.22) and the corresponding boundary
conditions will be determined, as usually accepted. by the behavior of small random
disturbances which can be inposed for any reasons on the investigated flow. If these
random disturbances are damping with tine. the given flow conditions will be stable;
if they build with time. than the flow conditions will be unstable. The equations

In system (1.2k), u, v, w are considered to be given coordinate functions. For the
case of a boundary layer when the velocities vary significantly more sharply with
respect to the y coordinate than with respect to the x coordinate, it is possible

to set u - u(y); v - w - 0. The variation of the velocity profile along the surface
is taken into account by successive calculation of the stability characteristics for
the velocity profiles in the boundary layer cross sections located at different dis-—
tances from the transverse edge of the body. Some argumnts indicating admissibility

Goertler Instability in a boundary Layer. The general solutions of systens (1.27)
and (1.28) under boundary conditions corresponding to the case of a bomdary layer
are unknown at the present tine. Researchers have been forced to consider the de-
fined forms of disturbing notion, selecting their forn considering the equations of
motion. Bare, being given the forn of the velocities of the disturbing notion as a
function of three variables (usually at. r. t) the system of partial differential
equations was reduced to a eystes of ordinary differential equations. the solution
of which has been investigated. The special position of the variable y is connected
with essential dependence of the nein flow characteristics on the transverse coordi-
nate. It is possible to indicate tvo basic forne of disturbing notion. The first
corresponds to giving snall harmonic oscillations of the type of traveling waves in
the boundary layer

The sign of the real exponent B in (1.30) definss the variation of the disturbances
in tine. Relations (1.29) and (1.30) in which the variables x and t change places
can serve as a variation of the disturbing notion. In this case the develop-ant of
disturbances is investigated not in tine, but downstream. If on the basis of the
equations of motion and boundary conditions the disturbances increase with an in-

crease in the r-coordinate. the notion is considered unstable; otherwise it is con-
sidered stable.

For the existence of disturbances of the type of (1.30) in the boundary layer. the
presence of a dynanic situation in which additional centrifugal forces of inertia
and the corresponding transverse pressure gradients arise (the second equation of
the system (1.27)) is necessary. These conditions occur. in particular. for flow
over a concave surface. If the wall is flat or convex, which in the nejority of
cases is of the greatest interest, the vortex instability does not arise (see below).

Then disturbances of the type of (1.29) are considered which theoretically can exist
both on convent and concave surfaces. Therefore they play a very ilportant role in
the theory of hydrodynamic stability of the boundary layer, a consequence of which
is their detailed investigation in the following sections.

However. recently Goertler,et al. investigated sons inortant aspects of the appli-
cation of vortex theory which sakes a brief discussion of its basic results neces-
sary. When investigating the Goertler nethod we shall begin with the system of
equations (1.27). Let us exclude pressure free the equations of notion and substi-
tute the expressions for the velocities of the disturbing notion (1.30). Here we
consider that the pressure of the disturbing notion does not depend on the x coordi-
nate. In addition, in equations (1.27) we neglect values on the order of Ur.
Since the thickness of the boundary layer 6 is usually selected as the characteris-
tic dimension, the corresponding errors will he on the order of 6/: << 1. The tern
(2/r)u-v in the second equation of (1.27). constitutes an exception. It cannot be
dropped,‘becauae the inertial forces are deternined only by it for neutral distur-
bances (B - 0). Por the case of neutral disturbances we find theAfollowing systen

In addition. the require-ant of disappearance of the disturbing notion for y r '- is

The system (1.32) with boundary conditions (1.33) was first obtained and investigated
by GoertlerlloO], [lol]. Later the folloving authors studied the solution of the '
investigated problen: Heksyn [62]. line-erlin [63], [66], Prina [66], and Slith [65].
The last two researchers used the Galerhin .0th for approxilste integration of the

systen (1.32). A detailed discussion of the neth and corresponding bibliography
can be found in the nonograph by Hikhlin [67]. Various problem of the application
of the Galerkin method to the problems of hydrodynanic stability are contained in
references [‘81-[53], [81].

For explanation of the further course of the investigation of boundary layer stabil-
ity in the presence of vortex disturbances, let us consider the solution of the
problem (I.32)-(l.33) by the Galerkin nethod. the studies by Goertler [60], [loll
demonstrated thst the stability characteristics of a laminar bounary layer with
respect to the investigated disturbances depend very slightly on the form of the
velocity profile. Therefore, according to Prima, we consider

“=!I:(0<y<l); ‘

Proceeding according to the general scheme of the Galean nethod [67], let us select

l — flow near a concave wall; 2 - flow in the vicinity of the

The instability of laminar flows with respect to vortex disturbances can be observed
not necessarily only near concave surfaces ()igure 1.8). The studies by Goertler
[$4] and Has-serlin [551 detected an analogous picture of loss of stability for a
flow in the vicinity of the critical point. Significantly before the indicated
theoretical solutions, the fact of loss of stability of a flow near the frontal
point of a cylinder over which flow was taking place was established eaperinentally
by Piercy and Richardson 156]. [57]. The noted fact of loss of stability of the
laninar fora of flow in the vicinityof the critical point can have practical sig-
nificance, for the arbitray vortices for-ed in the flow can play the role of ester~
nal disturbances (turbulence of the external flow) the intensity of which essentially
determines the critical Reynolds nuber (see Chapter V). Accordingly. it is neces-
sary to recouend that the forward end of bodies with controlled boundary layer
(control for purposes of laninsriastion) be made with as little fullness as possible
so that the region of undesirable distortion of the current lines will be least.

The vorticea with longitudinal area can also arise in the boundary layer developed
on a plane or convex surface as a result of the appearance of the appearance of

wave disturbances of the type of (1.29). The studies of Goertler and Hitting [58]
demonstrated that if the oscillation anplitude f the fluid particles in the bound-
sry layer reaches a value on the order of 1'1 6*, conditions are created for the
occurrence of a "secondary instability" connected with vortices of the type of
(1.30). The importance of the indicated result in connection with the creation of
the general theory of transition is obvious [59]. [60]. In addition, it is possible
to expect that for unavoidable vibration of the skin of reel bodies saving in the
water, the Goertler instability will have defined significance.

A list of basic papers studying vortex instability can be found in the surveys by
Goertler [61], [62]. [63].

Energy Method of Investigating Instability. In addition to the above-discussed ntbod
of small disturbances based on studying the behavior of a defined fore of velocity
fluctuations in the boundary layer with the help of linearised equations of notion,
there is the so-called energy method of investigating the stability of the laninar
fans of flow [6‘], [66]. Its essence consists in the fact that the behavior of the
kinetic energy of the disturbing notion in tine is investigated. If the kinetic
energy at any selected point in tine is increasing. the notion is considered un-
stable; if it is decreasing, the laminar flow conditions are defined as stable.

The sign of the derivative of the kinetic energy of the disturbance with respect to
tine is investigated using the relation obtained free the equations of disturbed

notion [32], [29]. It is natural that it is inpoaaihle to define all the values of
Vx’ vy. p entering into one equation (the tvovdinensional case) by using only one

equation and the corresponding boundary under initial conditions. Therefore it is
necessary to give the form of the disturbances. For the case of elliptic vorticea
proposed by Lorentz [64], detailed calwlationa appear in the nonograph [29].

Let us discuss some of the assumptions used as the basis for deriving the energy
balance equation of disturbing notion

In equality (1.39) the basic notion is characterized by the presence of only veloc«‘-
ity along the x-axis u - u(y); the velocity along the y-axis is absent (v - 0).

The derivative of the kinetic energy of a fluid with respect to tile entering into
(1.39) is calculated as follows:

that is. it is assured that the fluid particles are transported only with the ve-
locity of the nain flow. This proposition appears to be sufficiently strong, for
near the wall the velocity of the main flat: in the boundary layer can be couensu-
rate with the velocities of the disturbances. Hriting the derivative in the fore of
(1.60) is actually equivalent to the condition of slallnees of the disturbances.

Let us obtain the energy balance equation analogous to (1.39) using arguments free
of the indicated assumption. Let us begin with the equation of notion of a viscous

Investigation of expression (1.53) is useful for understanding the physical nature
of the processes occurring in e laninsr boundary- layer on appearance of randon dis-
turbances in it. Actually, let us first consider the second tors in the right-hand
side. It is always positive and enters with the sign of the ndnunn, i.e., it prarotes a
decrease in the kinetic energy of the disturbing notion by converting it to heat.
This process is naturally deterninad by the fluid viscosity. The first tern of the
right-hand side of the indicated equality characterizes the work of the ao-called
"Reynolds stress" Jar—T. which can transfer the energy fron the basic notion to
disturbances. In orde¥ that the kinetic energy of the disturbance increase, it is
necessary in the sinplest case where 3v/ax - 0 Chat the signs of the Reynolds stress

appears at a point of the layer I with the coordinate x in accordance with the

fluid flow arises with velocity («v ) fron layer ll to layer 1. For positive velo-
city gradient of the basic flow au 73y > 0, the fluid particles saving free layer
11 will have velocity in the direction of the sain current greater than the fluid
particle in the layer 1, that is. they will pronote an increase in the occurring

disturbance v at the point of the layer I with the coordinate: Here an in-
crease in the disturbance will take place as a result of the kinegic _energy of the

nain flow. It is obvious that the sign of the Reynolds stress (-pv_ v y) will be
positive in the investigated case.

in Figure 1.9. the velocities of the disturbing flow are illustrated for clarity in
the right-hand side of the basic flow velocity disgran. In conclusion of the pre-
sented argtnnent it is necessary again to consider the inportant role which is played
by the property of continuity of the aediun in the process of develop-mt of the
disturbances expressed by the continuity equation.

If the equation (1.53) is written in dinenaionlese fore, taking. for example, the
thickness of the boundary layer 6 as the characteristic thickness and the velocity

at the boundary of the boundary layer u as the characteristic velocity. then equat-
ing the right—hand side of (1.53) to re 0, it is possible to dstsrnine the critical

Reynolds nuater defining the existence of neutral disturbances, the kinetic energy

An actual calculation of the critical Reynolds nunber by fornula (1.56) can be ads
for the known velocities of the disturbing notion. Functions defining the values
of v‘, vy nust satisfy the equations of notion and continuity equation. I'or each

for. of disturbance, generally speaking, there will be a critical Reynolds War.
The least critical Reynolds nunber out of the corresponding set for all-possible

disturbances will define the boundary below which laninar notion will always exist,
that is, all of the randon disturbances entering the boundary layer will be damped.

Thus, one equation (1.54) is inadequate for detersining the nininun critical Reynolds
number for the boundary layer. It is also necessary to integrate the equations of
notion for disturbances. If we consider any disturbances, not relating then to

the equations of notion of a fluid, low Reynolds ntaabere are naturally obtained.

Usually when investigating the work of the Reynolds stresses in the boundary layer.
absence of a basic flow velocity normal to the surface v - 0 is seamed. For a
boundary layer developed on an inperneable surface. this sssmption is sufficiently
substantiated. In the case of fluid suction across the surface. it is necessary to
have a cautious attitude toward the indicated asst-ption. For eagle. for slot

auction there are sections on the surface of the body where sharp variation of the
basic flow velocity takes place in the direction of the y-exis. In these areas lo-

cated in direct proximity to the slots, it is inosaible obviously to neglect the
derivative 3v/3x in the fornula for the Reynolds stress

“"E (%+%)' (1.55)

for, in spite of the small value of v. its variation near the wall takes place very
rapidly. Fornula (1.55) shorts that the initial section of the slot has a favorable
influence on the laninar boundary layer stability. for the turbulent Reynolds stress
transferring the energy to the disturbance at the leading edge of the slot decreases
as a result of the presence of 3v/3x < 0. The trailing edge of the slot, conversely,
has a negative influence on stability. for the presence of avian > 0 increases the
total Reynolds stress. The nature of the stress -pv v - avlax is exactly the sale
as -0vxvy~3u/3y. The practical conclusion which can“ drawn when investigating

forsula (1.55) is that fron the point of view of increasing stability. the slot not
be designed so that the nornal suction velocity gradient in the direction of the :—

aris on the trailing edge will be the least possible. and on the forward edge, the
highest.

Of course, when selecting the forn of the slot it is necessary also to consider the
inportant requirasent of least drag of the slot for the given fluid flow rate. In
view of the necessity for solving the equations of disturbed notion to obtain a re-
liable value of the critical Reynolds order. in contrast to the shell oscillation

method, the energy nethod has not found significant practical development. Its basic
value consists in the explanation of the physical aspects of the develop-eat and
damping of disturbances in a boundary layer.

Surveys of research in laninar boundary layer stability can be found in references
[6]. [12]. [671-03]. [111]. [112].

§ IJo. Snell Oscillations hethod. Orr-So-srfsld Equation

In the linear statenent of the problen, the velocity conponents of the disturbing
notion nust satisfy system (1.28). The basis for investigating snall disturbances
is the fact that it is always possible to asauns conditions of develop-ant of the
laninar forn of flow such that the external tendon disturbances will not exceed a
given value. The practical possibility of insuring such conditions is confirned by
experinentsl research (5 1.10) denonstrsting very cowlete coincidence of the ob-

served processes of develop-est of disturbances in a laminar boundary layer with
linear theory.

The problees of the behavior of finite disturbances in laninar flows are discussed

in references [1001-[110]. however, the difficulties of studying a nonlinear system
of partial differential equations describing the behavior of finite disturbances
do not pernit creation of a final theory of their develop-eat which, of course,

point and region of developed turbulent notion.

Condition (1.56) is strictly satisfied only for the Poiseuille flow which follows
free the Navier-Stohes equations [29]. It is not valid for flow in the boundary
layer. when studying lasinsr boundary layer stability. Pretsch (1e) made an effort
to consider the variation of u along the sell and also the presence of the velocity
conponent v in the boundary layer. 0n the basis of the approxinate nature of the
methods of solving the problen of laninsr flow stability in s boundary layer (see
the following itens) it turned out that the refines-ants of Pretsch are seeningless,
for the corrections that he introduced are beyond the liaits of the approxinstion in
which the problem is solved.

The next simplifying assunption is two-dinensionality of the investigated disturb-
ances. here we base our argunents on the proof of Squire [7A]. [12], who denou-
atrated that two—dinensional disturbances of the traveling cave type are sure dan-
gerous in the sense of the occurrence of instability than three-diseasional ones.
This problen was the subject of a paper by 1. Tssya-Chnn‘ [75]. It is possible to
find interesting expetiaental confirsation of the discussed proposition in the paper
by Sehulte-Grunov [76]. I‘ve-dimensional transverse oscillations corresponding to
the points 1, 2, 3 in the vicinity of the neutral stabilitv curve (Figure 1.10) were
also isposed on a two-dinensional lanine! flee using an oscillating wing. The

curve in Figure 1.10 use constructed by the data of Tolkien [17]. Point 1 corres-
ponds to the dsnping disturbances. and point 2 corresponds to mtual disturbances;
point 3 corresponds to building disturbances. In addition to transverse disturbances
longitudinal disturbances were created in the (lac using individual roughness ele—
ments. here it turned out that the presence of additional longitudinal disturbances
use not felt at all at the beginning of loss of stability of the basic Janina! flow
(Figures 1.11-1.13). In Figure 1.11 it is obvious that longitudinal disturbances

3 (Figure 1.13) they build, that is. transverse planar disturbances for which the

mum investigating stability of the leninar forn of flow near a rigid surface it is
natural to consider that adhesion conditions are observed on the wall, that is, for

§ 1.6. Construction of Solutions of the Ora-Comfeld Equation

In the general case of giving the function u(y) it is iapossible to indicate enact
solution of equation (1.59) under the boundary conditions (1.60). (1.61), (1.63).
(1.66). Therefore various approxiaate neth of constructing partial solutions of
the investigated equation are used. In (1.59) the coefficients are regular functions
of the variable y in the interval 0 j y _<_ 1, that is, in the vicinity of any point
yo free the indicated interval they can be expanded in converging series of the type

shady—10'. 11 ly-“l<0-'

where the values of p > 0 (the symbol a determines to which coefficient i the
given convergence radTus pertains). Consequently [82], in this interval it is
possible to find the solution of equation (1.59) in the for: of a series with re-
spect to powers of an independent variable. If series for four independent solu-
tions of equation (1.59) can be constructed such that they will converge unifornly
in the region of definition of y, the existence of the fundamental system of solu-
tions of equation (1.59) will be proved at the sens tine. In vies of the fact that
the coefficients in (1.59) are also regular functions of certain parameters (a, c,
Ilene), using sasllness of sole of than (c, Ilene) it is possible to construct solu-
tions in the for. of series with respect to powers of these psrsaeters. Heisenberg

[83] and Lin [67], who investigated the given nethod in detail proceeded in this
fashion in their research.

Determining the solutions of the first equation of system (1.66), it is then possible
by the method of variation of arbitrary constants successively to determine all the
functions . however. usually we are limited in the series (1.65) to onl the

first term, permitting an error in determining 0(y) on the order of (003)“ , and the
problem thus reduces to integration of the equation

(u — €)(9'—-a’9)— «('9 = 0. (1.67)

Equation (1.67) determines the development of disturbances in antideal fluid. It
must be renmsbered, of course. that the effect of the viscosity is felt in the for-
nation of the function My). which. in turn. determines the variation across the
boundary layer of the velocity pulsation enlitude. neglecting the viscosity lowered
the order of equation (1.59). in connection with which it is necessary to use another
approximate method of integration (1.59) discussed below to find the missing solu-
tions. The differential equation (1.67) has a singularity at the point y - ’k’
where u(yk) - c. This case corresponds to comparison of the propagation rate of

a neutral disturbance in the boundary layer with the basic flow velocity. It is
possible to explain the processes occurring in the layer y - y , which is called the
“critical layer," by the following arm-ant [86). Let us intrgduce the disturbing
notion vortex into the investigation

' " 96?"? -(a’9-9')c"“""

and the basic motion vortex n - van/3y. Than equation (1.67) can be represented as
follows:

(u—c)-g;-+%-o,= o. (1.68)

Equality (1.68) expresses the condition of preservation of the vortices in an ideal
fluid. If for y - yk, may f 0. then (as/3y», 9‘ 0, for in the general case v’(yk)

1‘ 0. Therefore for observation of the equality (1.68). its first tern (u - c)3r/3x
must also be nonzero. For u - c -> 0 this can occur only in the case of atlas * 0’.
that is, in a critical layer in the absence of viscosity the vortex of the disturb-
ing notion increases without limit. In order to bring the calculation scheme in
accordance with reality in the critical layer it is necessary to consider the

effect of viscosity which will also be done when finding the solutions of equation
(1.59) as a function of viscosity.

it is possible to reduce these expressions to the fan (1.78) and (1.79). The region

The inequality (1.95) shows that when going around the critical point y - yk it is

§ 1.7. Construction of the Neutral Stability Curve for Given Velocity Profile in
the Boundary Layer

Beginning with the general forn of the solution (1.96) and considering the boundary
conditions (1.60). (1.61) and (1.63), it is possible to obtain a unifors cysts. of
linear algebraic equations with respect to the constants c1. c2, c3:

(191(0) 4‘ ‘19:“), ‘1 €8,8(0) "-‘ 0

-| c_,[1p;(l)l-aq>,(l)l= 0
From the condition of limited nature of the solution at infinity it follows that

- 0. In order that the uniforn systen (1. 97) have nonzero solutions with respect
t3 c1, c2, c3. it is necessary and sufficient that its detersinant be equal to zero

In equation (1.98) relating the values of a, Re, c, let us neglect the terns which
include the sun 05(1) + M30), for the function 950) + M30) very quickly de-

creases uith an increase in y. which is obvious fros (1.78). and it is in practice
equal to zero at the boundary of the boundary layer. It is possible also to see
this, considering the results of the Holstein [89] and Schlichting [90] calculations.

Let us transforn equation (1.98)

As a result, we obtain the coqlex equation

§ 1.8. Permian for Finding the Critical Reynolds Number

The form of the graph Re - Rem) having the shape of a loop is defined by the two-

valued nature of the function u - v01). This fact is a reflection of the dual

role of the viscosity in controlling , the disturbances occurring in a laminar

boundary layer. 0n the other hand, the viscosity is the cause of the occurrence of

a phase shift in the vicinity of the wall between the velocity components of the

disturbing notion, such that the Reynolds stress 1 - may begins to transfer energy

fron the basic notion to the disturbances [12]. On the other hand. the viscosity has
a danping effect on the disturbances occurring in the fluid.

Therefore the velocity profile without inflection points for Re + G (v -> 0) is stable
with respect to sinusoidal oscillations of any wavelength. for the vorticity distri-
bution across the boundary layer has a stabilising influence on the disturbances
that arise [12]. with an increase in viscosity. the Reynolds stresses arise, which
insure an inflow of energy into the disturbances in the wall region at the expense
of nain flow energy. Thus, in some range of values of a and Re, the disturbances
build with tine. The instability region arises inside the neutral curve on the
plane to, Re]. Further increase in viscosity leads to an increase in energy dissi—
pation, es a result of which all of the disturbances occurring in the laninsr boun-
dary layer are extinguished. The ninim- Reynolds nu-ber for which neutral oscilla-

equal to 0.58. Therefore. if z (c) < 0.58, there are two values of w and. conse-
quently, two values of Re corresponding to one value of c. If e is such that 11(c)-
0.58, then there is only one value of w, and, consequently, one value of the Re
number. The parameter a. defining the disturbance wavelength will also be uniquely
defined by formula (1.111).

In order to find the critical Reynolds number (he ), it is possible to indicate the
following procedure based on previous ar-zuments. Cl'F'or a given velocity profile in

formally be of the same nature as in the first interval. Detailed calculations by
the scheme discussed in § 1.7 demonstrated that in the region of negative w the
critical Reynolds numbers are also found to be negative which has no physical mean-
ing. In the range of S < u < 8, the neutral curve is actually deformed somewhat.
but on the basis of insignificant variation of the curve A, =-' 5. (W) . this deforma-
tion is found to be negligibly small and in no way is felt in the magnitude of the
critical Reynolds number. Calculations with respect to investigating the behavior
of the neutral curve in the indicated three intervals were performed for velocity
profiles with A - -2, 0, 2 (A is the Pohlhausen parameter when using a sixth-degree
polynomial for approximation of the velocity distribution in the boundary layer).

It must be noted that the formula for the critical Reynolds amber (1.115} differs
from the corresponding Lin formula [12]. [67]. This difference is explained by the
approximate nature of the methods of solving the problem of hydrodynamic stability
of the laminar form of flow, on the basis of which various authors can use a differ—
ent degree of approximation in their constructions. In particular, Lin [67] used
the approximate equality n - u'c for determination of the parameter a at the sue
time as the value of a use detgrnined fron the expression (1.111) when deriving

the formula (1.115).

5 1.9. Construction of Asymptotic Branches of a Neutral Stability Curve

The behavior of the neutral stability curve for the boundary layer for different
Reynolds numbers was investigated in the papers by Tollmien [210], [96], Schlichting
{13], Schlichting and Ulrich [15], and Lin [67]. In this section a study is made of
the behavior of a neutral curve for large values of the Re number based on the
expressions obtained above.

Let us consider the intersection of the polar diagram (Figure 1.15) with the positive
part of the x-axis. At this point F1 - 0, and consequently, in its vicinity the

5 1.10. Experinantal Confirmation of the Basic Conclusions of Stability Theory

The study of the stability of s laninar boundary layer has developed historically
so that the first results were obtained in the theoretical studies by Tollnien and
Schlichting. It was only after 13 years that Schubauer and Shrsnsted, creating a
flow with a low degree of turbulence (0.021), confirmed all the basic conclusion
of the theoretical research of [6]. [11]. [lb] and [12] well.

Schubauer and Skransted performed uperinents on a plate. Oscillations of different
frequency were created in a boundary layer using a natal plate and electronsgnets.
Observing the development of these oscillations, it was possible to determine under

what conditions the oscillations do not danp and do not build. The corresponding
dimensionless frequency of neutral oscillations defined the point in the plane [-Reﬁ,

Brv/U . where at . u-c-Uo/G. It is also possible to reconstruct the theoretical

curve Re* - Re*. (0*) in the plane (Raﬁ, B v/Uzl. for each point (03*. Re") of the
indicated curve corresponds to a defined vilue of c (Figure 1.19).

A conparison of the theoretical calculations with the experimental sets of Schubauer
and Skraneted is shown in figure 1.21. Schubauer and Skr :ssted nde their measln'e-
ments in the boundary layer using a thermosnuomatric device.

Recently Burns. Childs, Nicol and Ross [97] performed analogous studies in the boun-
dary layer. However. for measurements of the velocity pulsations they used a light

plate which underwent oscillatory movements under the effect of the transverse com-
ponent of the pulsation velocity in the boundary layer. The plate oscillations were
recorded using a reflected beam. Bxperinental points are shown on Figure 1.21.

Stability theory also found qualitative confirmation in the experinsntal paper by
Berg [98]. Using snoke pluses, Berg observed oscillations of a wing in the boun-
dary layer (NAM-0012). A display was obtained on s stroboscope. The oscillation
source was a loud speaker generating sound of different frequency. The oscillations

were observed near the wing surface in the region of positive pressure gradients.

1n the three sention-d evperinental papers studies were performed in air flows.
Analogous experiments were set up in water by liortnsnn [26]. who used the telluric
nethod for visual representation of the flou'and llama [99]. In both cases the
oscillations in the boundary layer were created using a vibrating strip by the
«here first used by Schubauer and sure-sud.

The results of Hortmann and Hana, which agreed well with the theoretical results and
the data of other authors are presented in figure 1.21.

Investigation of the expression for the ssplitude of the disturbing motion current
function (5 1.6 and § 1.7) indicates that as a result of the presence of a singula-
rity at the point v - yk, for y > ’k the disturbing notion is described by a for-
nula of the tyne

Thus. for transition through a critical layer, a phase discontinuity arises in the
oscillations deternining the disturbing notion. This conclusion was obtained
theoretically by Toll-ion. The experiments of Schubauer and stunted confined

it brilliantly. They were also able to obtain surprising cowariaon of the awlitude
distribution of the oscillations across the boundary layer uith the Schlichtinz
calculations [90].

It is also necessary to point out the recently published results of the esperinantal
studies of Schils [27] which agreed satisfactorily with thatbeoratical calculations
of the neutral stability curve. Using thernnsnenoneters. Schils studied the be-
havior of small disturbances introduced into the boundary layer of a plate, a
surface over which flow was taking place vibrating by a known law.

In conclusion of this section, let us present a statelent by one of the founders
of bydrodynanic stability theory. 1!. Schlichtins [lo]: "Experilental studies have

so brilliantly confirmed stability theory that it must be considered a fully checked-
out component part of hydroaeromechanics."

§ 1.11. Application of Stability Theory Results in Calculations of the Length of a
Laminar Segment of a Boundary Layer

By the length of the laminar segment we mean the distance between the initial (fron-
tal) point of the body over which the flow is taking place and the loss of stability
point of the laminar boundary layer. He exclude the transition some (see 5 1.1) from
the investigation, for its extent depends on several factors [4]. the most important
of which are the degree of turbulence of the external flow, the external pressure
gradient. and surface roughness.

Failure to consider the transition zone in the boundary layer leads to underestima-

tion of the length of the laminar segment, which goes "into reserve" for the calcu-
lations connected with laminarization of the boundary layer. For practical calcula-

tions of the loss of stability point of a laminar homdary layer on bodies with a
pressure gradient along the surface, it is necessary to have the function ke* -
Re* (A). Instead of the Pohlhausen form parameter it is possible to use anycsther
paf‘meter reflecting the relation between the pressure forces and frictional forces
in the boundary layer. Here it is necessary to consider that the f s of pro-
files constructed by different methods using the same parmaeter A - "“6 /y can
differ from each other on the basis of the limited nature of the single—parametric
method of approximating velocity profiles in the boundary layer. As an examle it
is possible to present a comparison of the family of profiles constructed by the
Pohlhausen method with the application of a fourth-degree polynomial [l3] and the
analogous family in the case of using a sixth-degree polynomial [15].

For the possibility of determining how the form of the approximation of the velocity
profiles in the laminar boundary layer influences the critical Reynolds number, cal-
culations were made by the scheme in § 1.8 of the functions Re* - Re* (A) based on
the family of Pohlhausen profiles (sixth degree polynomial), tﬁg uni; of Howsrt
profiles and the family of Basin profiles.

In the first case the velocity distribution across the boundary layer is expressed
by the formula

:1 = [1.01) + 10.01).

together with their first and second derivatives are presented in Table 1.3 taken
from reference [15]. The family of Howart profiles is determined by the following
dependence of the velocity at the boundary of the boundary layer on the longitudinal
coordinate U93) - U (l - r), where U - U(0); r - -(xIU )(dU/dx) (x ia__a dimensional
variable). If r < . then the velocgty increases with increase in x; if r > 0.
the velocity decreases with an increase in x. The velocity distribution in the
boundary layer depends on the magnitude of the parameter r. The values of the

functions u(y). u'(y), u"(y) taken from reference [13] are presented in Table 1.2.

tﬁe corresponding values of A6 and A3. Schlichting and Ulrich used the analogous

condition when establishing the relation )‘6 - A6Q6) [15]

cates the necessity for a careful approach to the pioblan of which method is used

the Pretsch and retervin calculations was the family of ﬂartrss profiles with

power dependence of the velocity at the outer boundary of of the boundary layer on
the longitudinal coordinate. Zaat also selected a single-parametric family of
velocity profiles in the boundary layer for his calculations. but the paraneter that
he used [95] differs from the Pohlhausen parameter. Comparison of the curves Be:r -

§ 1.12. Calculations of Stability of a Laminar Boundary Layer with Suction1

With relatively small removal of fluid from the wall. the stability of the laminar
boundary layer developed on it increases significantly [4]. [17]. [18]. During a
theoretical study of this phenomenon all of the researchers known to the authors of
this paper only considered the increase in fullness of the velocity profile in the
boundary layer with auction. The stability characteristics were calculated under
the assumption that the transverse velocities are absent in the boundary layer.

This statement of the oroblem saves it possible to use formulas § 1.7. 1.8 to calcu-
1ate the critical Reynolds number and neutral curve of anv velocity profile obtained

during suction.

A study of the stability of the laminar boundary layer in the presence of constant

The value of 3 - coast is the transverse velocity component of the nain flow in the
boundary layer. An example of a boundary layer with constant transverse velocity
is the asymptotic boundary layer with fluid auction at the lower boundary.

Substituting (1.127) in (1.126) and considering the usual (5 1.4) expression for the
current function of the disturbing notion

we obtain the following equation with respect to the amplitude of the current func-

where u(y) is the mean velocity distribution in the boundary layer.

Let us take the velocity at the boundary of the boundary layer as the characteristic

velocity U and the thickness of the boundary layer as the characteristic dinenaion
d, and let us rewrite the preceding equation in diaensionleas fore, retaining the
previous notation for the dimensionless variable U

The boundary conditions for equation (1.128) will be found fro- the following pre-
requisites. On the well for y - 0 the tangential component of the velocity of the
disturbing notion is absent on the basis of the adhesion condition. This leads to
expression (1.61). The presence of a constant transverse velocity of the Iain flow
for y - 0 theoretically pernits the existence of a normal velocity component of the
disturbing notion at the wall v (0) i 0. However, the presence of transverse oscil-
lations under the main flow conditions with a longitudinal velocity gradient for y Z_o

would have to unavoidably cause oscillations of the longitudinal component of the
velocity, that is, would contradict the condition vx(0) F 0. Therefore it is
necessary to consider the identity v (0) I 0, valid, which gives condition (1.60).
At the boundary of the boundary layer for y - 1 let us take the condition of meth-
ness cf the transition of the desired solution of equation (1.128) to the solution
for an ideal fluid. This condition is written as follows with accuracy to the first

0n the basis of arbitrariness of the constant A3 the two indicated equalities impose
only one condition (1.63) on the values of M1) 3and d)‘(1), which is obtained by find-

expressions (1.60), (1.61), (1.63) and (1.66). In the latter, it is necessary to
consider the value of [MI - t as snall as one night like. Usually this restric-

tion is not required when investigating stability problems by the snail oscilla-
tior nethod.

Let us note that the relative nagnitude of the transverse velocity v 1in the case of
boundary layer control using laninarisation is on the order of (Be)"1.where Re -
UG/v. Accordingly. as the first two solutions of equation (1.28) we take the
analogous solutions of the Orr-Somerfeld equation (1.72), (1.73), which are found
under the assumption of smallness of the right-hand side of the equation as a
function of viscosity.

In order to detenine the remaining two solutions of equation (1.128) let us lake
the substitution (1.71.), which converts (1.128) to the following expression:

In turn, finding the solution of equation (1.129) in the form of the series (1.76)
and limiting ourselves to the first two terns, which gives an error on the order of
(cr.Re)'1/2 , we find (see 5 1.6):

The value of v is on the order of l/Re; therefore the product vRe/Z is on the order

constructed under the assumption one >> 1. The relative propagation rate of the

sented in Figure 1.28. The depgdence of Re r on the parameter 2. and the relative
transverse velocity in the boundary layer iscshown in Figures 1.29, 1.30. Iron an
investigation of this function it is possible to draw the conclusion of the exist-
ence of a relative. velocity v for each velocity profile such that for a suction
velocity greater than v the ganinar boundary layer retains stability for all Rey-
nolds numbers. The gra s of the function v0 - v (2) and the corresponding function

than Re... If Re+ > Re > Re_, the flow is unstable.

For more conplete explanation of the indicated fact, neutral stability curves were
constructed for the velocity profile with the parameter 9. - 0.2. Each curve in
Figure 1.33 corresponds to a defined value of the paraneter I. If we calculate the
value of relative suction velocity v at each point of the neutral curves and join
the points with v - corst. then closed regions are obtained which are shovn in
figure 1.33 by the dotted line. Inside these regions the flow is unstable. and

outside then it is stable. For a defined suction velocity (v0), the instability
region degenerates to a point. Thus, for distributed auction, for purposes of
laninarization it is meaningful to increase the relative auction velocity only to a
defined amount corresponding to disappearance of the instability region. The pre-

§ 1.13. Stability of the Asynptotic Velocity Profile

The study of the stability of an asyuptotic velocity profile based on an infinite
plate with unifors and constant section with respect to the plate length plays a
special role in studies of the stability of a laninar boundary layer with auction.
The ssysptotic profile has the greatest fullness of the velocity diagram, and there-
fore it has the greatest stability by conparison with all velocity profiles foreed

on the plate with constant and uniforn suction. The critical Reynolds number was
calculated for asymptotic velocity profile in references [l7], [18]. For the

critical Reynolds nunher Pretsch obtained a value of he:r - 5.52'10‘; Buesnan and
Hunt found Reg: - 7-10‘.

Since in the calculations of the stability of laminar boundary layers with suction
these figures (more frequently a value of Re* - 7-10") are used to estimate the
required suction intensity and the calculatiShs by the nantioned authors were

The above-presented results were obtained without considering the influence of the
transverse velocity component of the main flee on the stability of the asymptotic
velocity profile. In the preceding 5 1.12. this calculation was performed. but the
magnitude of the relative pumping velocity was in no vay connected vith the velo-
city profile characteristics in the boundary layer. This statement of the problem
is valid for the accelerating segment of the boundary layer (l < 1). In the case of
an asynptotic velocity profile vhen the profile characteristics are rigidly connec-
ted with the suction belocity. consideration of the influence of the transverse
component of the velocity on the stability of the laminar form of flou requires
more precise definition. Let us perforn this study, using the results of § 1.12.

CHAPTER II. INFLUENCE OF SURFACE FLEXIBILITY OF A BODY OVER WHICH FLOW IS TAKING
PLACE 0N LAHINAB BOUNDARY LAYER STABILITY ' '

§ 11.1. Brief Survey of Studies of the Influence of Surface Flexibility on the Drag of
Bodies Moving in a Fluid

The idea of using a flexible surface for boundary layer control obviously was a con-
sequence of observations of the notion of fish and narine aninsls. The opinion
exists that narine aninals. in particular. dolphins. have acconodations still unknown
to nan which persit then to nove in the water at speeds greatly exceeding the nsxi-ns
speeds calculated on the basis of estinsting their power. Thus, it has been con-

firned that the drag of a dolphin‘s body is less than that of the corresponding
solid model.

It is possible to deternine the hydrodynanic drag of moving fish and urine aninsls
only indirectly, deternining their power developed to. sustain given speed.

Accordingly, the question arises of a reliable nethod of determining the power and
speed of aninste noving objects. An analysis of the known data on hydrodynanic re-
search perforned with dolphins appears in the paper by l'oche [23] written with the

participation of h. Schlichting. The corresponding bibliography is presented in
that paper.

Focke notes that the speed of dolphins has been determined by nsny observers both on
shore and iron a noving vessel. Elmer. in none of the described cases are data
presented on the equipnent by which the observations were nade so that the accuracy
of the neasurenents is unknown. This fact appears to be significant. for in order
to develop speeds of 9 and 11 n/sec. powers differing by approxinstely a factor of

2 are required. 0n observation free a loving vessel it is necessary to consider that
dolphins can use the energy of the syste- of waves occurring near a ship in their
novenent (a method of riding the waves known in Australia and Polynesia). and they
can also use the favorable pressure gradient in the vicinity of the bow. locks
performed calculations for a vessel 30 neters long and 6 neters wide moving at a
speed of 10 n/sec. It turned out that in the vicinity of the state a dolphin 2.75
neters long experiences a propelling force approxinately equal to 160 kg at the

sane tine as the drag of his body is about 15 kg at this speed. Analysing the lost

reliable sources, Pocke arrives at the conclusion that a dolphin can develop a speed
of up to 10 n/sec.

The power of dolphins can theoretically be determined by several nethods. The
najority of researchers. including Poets, consider it possible to take a specific

power of dolphins (power per kg of msculature) approxinately the same as for' nan

96

and other mammals. that is, about 5 kg-i/sec. Some researchers have perfoer
special experiments to determine the power of dolphins. The American scientist
Hero observed a dolphin weighing 180 kg juping. In 0.6-0.7 seconds this dolphin
developed a speed permitting him to jump 2.1 meters out of the water (-his speed

- having the water was about 125 knots). Calculations show that his specific
power was in this case 3 5 kg-m/sec. In the opinion of biologists. the most exact
method of finding power is connected with measuring the consumed oxygen, but as
applied to such relatively large subjects as dolphins, this procedure runs into
technical difficulties.

Investigation of the available data at the present time does not permit definite
conclusions to be drawn that the drag of the dolphin's body is appreciably less than
the drag of the corresponding rigid models. However, it is necessary to mention

the experimental studies of Kramer [ll-[3], which were an impetus to the development
of the discussed method of boundary layer control.

In his first paper [1], H. 0. Kramer describes experiments with a rotating cylinder
(inside diameter 50.8 cm, height 25.4 cm). the inside walls of which. in contact
with the water poured into the cylinder; were covered with a damping layer. The
cylinder was rotated at a speed of up to 720 rpm. The given angular velocity was
sustained for 10 minutes until the fluid in the cylinder began to turn as a solid
body. Then the cylinder stopped. and the rotational velocity of the fluid in the
cylinder was measured. The flow conditions in the cylinder were determined by the
variation of the rotational velocity of the fluid with time.

The critical Reynolds number (the diameter of the inside circle of the cylinder was
taken as the characteristic length. and the rotational velocity of the inside
circle of the cylinder before stopping was taken as the characteristic velocity),
using the best version of flexible covering was 2.6 times greater than the corre-
sponding critical Reynolds number in the case of a rigid surface.

Obtaining hopeful results in the experiments with a cylinder, Kramer performed the
following series of tests under conditions closer to the actual nature of flow over
bodies [2]. A solid of revolution (1. - 2.“ m, D - 6.35 cm) in the four of a cylinder with

adapter lo? cm long was towed behind a boat developing a speed up to 35 knots on
a thin (d - 2.36 mm) steel line 5.18 meters long. The forward half of the model,

covered with various coverings. was attached to a spring, the detonation of which a};
recorded by strain gages. made it possible to determine the drag acting on the
tested surface. A corpsrison was made with a standard rigid surface.

The maximum gain in the drag was 591 for “I. - 1.5.107.

In reference [3] Kramer describes experiments which are a development of the pre-
ceding studies. Improvements pertained to the towboat (the boat speed could vary
up to 1.0 knots) and the design of the covering which had ribs as the elements
supporting the outer diaphragm instead of columns as in the preceding version.

Positive results were obtained from the experiments although the decrease in the
drag was somewhat less than in the case of the "calm" covering.

Soon after publication of the experinsntal results of H. 0. Kramer, the paper by
Benjamin [lo] appeared in which the first effort was ends to give a theoretical

97

analysis of the stability conditions of the laminar boundary layer on a flexible
surface. Benjamin solved the problem for the following wall boundary conditions:

9' (0) + aim — o. (11.1)
9(0) =- M. (11.2)

where a is the couples amplitude of the harmonic oscillations of the wall surface.

The bcundary condition (11.2) corresponds to the assumption that the normal compon-
ent of the disturbance velocity at the wall is equal to the velocity of the move-
nent of the wall in the direction of the y—sxis. The boundary condition (11.1) re-
lstes the tangential velocity cowonent of the disturbing motion to the deforntion
of the wall and velocity distribution in the main flow.

For determination of the surface deforesti .n the normal direction Benjamin uses
a formula obtained from the Navier-Stohes equations without considering the term
that depend on the viscosity.

The indicated boundary conditions and adopted simplification when determining the
pressure on the wall permitted Benjnin to obtain a relatively simple form of the
basic characteristic equation of the problem - However. even in the case of
surface deformstion' by a trip wire vibrating in the resistant medium he was

unable to come up with a method of calculating the critical Reynolds
numbers for different characteristics of a flexible surface.

The article by Landahl [5] is a development of Benjamin's work. in this article the
author, using benjamin's ssumption, takes the first steps to discover general Laws
controlling the successful operation of flexible surface in the sense of laminarisa-
tion.

The study by Becker [6], [7], where he investigates various conditions of supplying
energy to a fluctuating wall from the incompressible laminar layer side. is very
similar to the ideas of Benjamin‘s work.

R. Betchov demnstrated an original approach to the solution of the problem of lami-
nar boundary layer stability [8]. lie divided the disturbances in a laminar bound-
ary layer into three parts: disturbances. the behavior of which is described by

the inviscid Orr-Somrfeld equation. disturbances connected with the presence of
a "visdd" zone near the wall and disturbances determined by the effect of viscos-

ity in the critical layer where the velocity in the boundary layer coincides with
the disturbance propagation rate.

An equation equivalent to the characteristic equation use obtained from the espres-
sion v (0) - 0. It is proposed that this equation be solved graphically. The
characferistic equation is generalized to the case of a surface that is compliant in
the normal direction.

The strictest statement of the problaa of laminar boundary layer stability on a f lax--
ible .surface appears in the paper by Boggs and Tohita [9]. liriting out the rela-
tions for this surface deformation as a function of normal and tangential stresses
on the wall, they then use the incomplete characteristic equation and present their

98

FOROFHCIALISEONLY
FOR‘OFFKJAL.USE(NNLY

arguments without considering the conditions at the upper boundary of the boundary
layer. However. even this simplification and neglecting the influence of the tan-
gential deformation on stability did not offer them the possibility of indicating
a specific way to calculate the critical Reynolds number for various characteris-
tics of a flexible covering.

A qualitative investigation of the behavior of a flexiblesurface under the effect
of a fluid flow over it appears in the papers by Nonweiler [10] and Benjanin [11],
[15].

A description of experiments in determining the influence of foes polyurethane
coverings on the position of the laminarbto-turbulent boundary layer transition

point on models of wings is given in the paper by bregory and Love [12].

The study of the stability conditions of a Poseuine flowin the presence of flexible
boundaries made by Rains and Price [13], [16] is closely adjacent to the mentioned

During oscillations the film experienced drag proportional to the first power of the
velocity. The inertial forces connected with the mass of the film and the forces
proportional to the shift of the film in the normal direction Glexibility of the
base) were not taken into account. Calculations cf neutral curves for different
film tensions and drag coefficients were made on computers. The calculation re-
sults gave closed instability regions in some cases.

In connection with the discussed problem it is necessary to note the cycle of pa-
pers by Miles studying wind wave generation. The basic results of these papers with
the corresponding references can be found in the survey article [16].

§ 11.2. Boundary Conditions for the Orr—Sommerfeld Equation in the Case of a
Flexible Surface

The problem of stability of the laminar form of flow nesra flexible surface differs
from the analogous problem for a rigid wall by the boundary condition for y - 0.

Hhereas in the case of a rigid surface the velocity componsnnzof the disturbing mo—

tion at the wall are equal to zero, in the case of a flexible surface it is natural
to assume that on the basis of satisfaction of the adhesion condition. they are

equal to the corresponding velocity components of the wall surface points. Deforma-
tion of a flexible surface. in turn, is connected with tangential and normal stresses
on the surface of the body caused by velocity pulsations of the disturbing motion in
the flow. we shall consider only small deformations of the well such that their in-
fluence on the basic velocity profile can be neglected.

Let us be given the following equations relating the surface stresses and strains

The boundary conditions obtained on the wall are a consequence of the adopted re-

which. in spite of its simplicity is very general. Thus. for ample, relation

The dimensionless paraneters It (11.9) and I (11.15) play the role of sinilarity
criteria characterizing the properties of the covering. For the sane mechanical
characteristics of the covering, its operating efficiency depends on the density of
the fluid flowing over the body, the square of the flow velocity at the boundary

of the boundary layer and the thickness of the boundary layer. it is necessary to
consider the significant increase in relative conpliance of the covering with an
increase in velocity. Since the thickness of the laminar boundary layer is inverse-
ly proportional to 01/2, with in inzreaae in velocity the compliance of the cover-
ing varies proportionally to I! I This fact ashes it possible to hope for success

in using dalping coverings for laninariration at high flow velocities over a f lex-
ible surface.

studying laminarization.

Let us discuss the nethod beginning with the basic Lin concepts [19] which he de-

The scheme for calculating the critical Reynolds umber as a function of the parame-
ter k for a given velocity profile in the boundary layer and for a given value of
the parameter 91 reduces to the following.

1. Being given the numerical value of the derivative kc and knowing the values of
61 and u“) (the velocity profile is given), let us calculate A and B by for-nae

(11.23) and (11.26). Let us note that it is spossible to give the value of k with-
out relating it to the value of c. for in this case the right-hand sides of equali-
ties (11.25) will be functions not only of u, but also the para-ate: c which excludes
the possibility of using the basic Lin concept (§ 1.7).

§ 11.4. Calculations of the Critical Reynolds timber of a Lainar Boundary Layer

as a Function of the Characteristics of a Cowliant Surface in the Normal Direction
and the Pohlhausen Form Parameter

The methods discussed in this section permit calculation of the loss of stability
point of a laminar boundary layer developed on an elastic surface with known charac-
teristics k and 81. However, such calculations are very tedious. For significant
amplification of the process of finding the loss of stability point on elastic
surfaces the universal relations Reﬁt - Ra* (It. 61) were constructed for different
values of the parameter A. cr cr

The perforned calculations indicate that the value of the critical Reynolds amber
varies monotonically with variation of the paranetar k and has an obvious peak on
variation of 61 within the interval 0' f. 61 < 360‘. Moreover, in none range of
variation of 61 the critical Reynolds masher on an elastic surface becomes less
than the value for a rigid wall.

This fact has exceptionally important significance. for it indicates the necessity
for careful selection of the coverings designed to damp pz‘lsations in a lanai-

nar boundary layer. It cannot be expected that the softer the coating, the greater
the effect from using it. It can turn out to he the opposite if the daQing proper-

ties are iaproperly selected.

In connection with what has been discussed, all of the following calculations were
perforned for a fixed value of 01 - 60’. The basis for the calculations was the

family of Pohlhausen profiles defined by a sixth-degree polynomial.

Figures 11.3 and 11.6 show the results of calculating a family of curves Raﬁr - Reg:
0., k) for 61 - 60°. The rapid growth of the critical Reynolds under wit
variation of the parameter It in the interval 0'_< It 5 l attracts attention.

In addition to finding the critical Reynolds nuaher which was determined by the

scheme in 5 11.3 directly without constructing a neutral curve, it is of defined
interest to consider the nature of variation of the wavelength of the disturbance

which, as before, causes instability, and its propagation rate as a function of the
characteristics of the elastic covering.

The corresponding graphs were constructed for three velocity profiles defined by
values of the paraneter A - 2, 0; -2 (Figures 11.5, 11.6).

From Figure 11.5 it is obvious that with an increase in It the wavelength of a
dangerous disturbance increases sharply (X - 216m). and its propagation rate along
the x-axis drops sharply (Figure 11.6).

Considering the fasily of curves Re:r - Re:r(A. so (Figure 11.1l), it is possible to

draw the conclusion that the cospliance of the surface in the tangential plane over
which flow takes place has insignificant influence on the lasinar boundary layer
stability. This infleunce, which is perceptible for ssell critical Reynolds nunbers
(the range of negative values of the paraseter A). decreases with an increase in A,
and for A 3 4, it becones in practice negligibly snail. This is explained by the
fact that the influence of the surface coapliance in the tangential plane on the
boundary layer stability is inversely proportional to the Reynolds nusber as follows
fro. the second boundary condition (11.17).

5 11.7. Energy Exchange of Oscillatory Notions of a Pluid and a Hall

Let us consider the direction of energy flow on interaction of a atrean with a
flexible wall. Knowing this direction sakes it possible to deter-ins the nature of
the operation of the covering. 1f the energy flow is frol the fluid to the well,
work is done by the pressure forces in the flow; consequently, the covering can be
classified as passive, oscillating under the effect of the pressure forces. If the
energy flow is directed from the wall to the fluid, work is done by certain external
forces applied to the covering and not connected with pressures in the flow over the
surface. Such a covering can be called "active."

Stability of the laninar fors of flow in a boundary layer developed on an oscilla-
tory surface does not depend directly on the direction of the energy flow at the

investigated interface. For example, it cannot be said that if work is forned by
the pressure forces free the fluid, the disturbances causing these pressures will

deep. and vice versa. the direction of energy flow into the fluid does not neces-
sarily lead to an increase in pulsation energy and, consequently, to buildup of the
pulsations.

The indicated fact is connected with the presence of another source of energy trans-
fer to a disturbing motion. which is basic. This source is the Reynolds stresses

which define the process of energy transfer fron the nsin flow to the disturbances.
If it turns out to be possible to control the magnitude of the Reynold stresses, it

116

FOR OFTNCJAL USE()NLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

is possible to regulate the development of the disturbing notion. Therefore it can
turn out that in the presence of an energy flow fro- the wall to the fluid the
Reynolds stresses decrease. and the disturbances in the flow dininiah. The opposite
picture is also possible when the energy flow is directed to the wall, but the
energy of the disturbing motion increases as a result of the energy of the aain flour.
for the magnitude of the Reynolds stresses increases.

The results of the calculations presented in § 11.6 encompass all coverings, active

and passive, for all possible phase shifts between the pressure in the flow and the
wall displacmts were considered there. Optimal phase shifts have been established
for which the stability of a laminar boundary layer increases to the highest degree.
Accordingly. it is of interest to determine what coverings (passive or active) have
these phase angles that are the best free the point of view of laninarization.

Energy flow per unit surface displaced with a velocity v alder the effect of pres-
sure p' is calculated by the ordinary fornula yw

N =. —p,-u,.. (11.“)

The minus sign in (11.46) is taken because under the effect of a positive pressure
in the flow the surface moves in the negative direction of the y-exis. if when cal-
culating by formula (11.44), N > 0. then the work is done bv the pressure forces and
the covering is "passive." If N < 0. then the energy flow is directed to the fluid.
and the covering operates as an "active" covering. The values of p" and v“ are con-

plex variables which vary harmonically with respect to the a-coordinate and time.
Therefore. considering an area with the coordinate x - x0. we can write

Fornula (11.65) does not depend on the choice of the point so; therefore it is valid
for the entire surface.

The stabili y calculations perforned in S 11.5 for the case of a surface that is
compliant in the normal direction corresponded to the following relation of the
surface deforestion and pressure:

From a comparison of (11.68) and (11.66) we see that the phase shift between the
pressure on the wall and the velocity is defined by the sum
‘ T " (11.69)

Substituting (11.69) in (11.65), we arrive at the following expression for the energy
flow at the interface of the fluid and elastic surface

N '" '— +lﬂ.l-lu,,lsm0.. (11.1.50)
Go the basis of (11.50). we obtain the following conclusions:
a) if 180' > 81 > 0°. then N < 0 and the covering must he considered "active":
b) if 360' > 81 > 180°. then N > 0, and the coverine must be considered "passive";

r) if 61 - 0°. 01 - 180°. the energy flow is absent, and the covering can in this
sense be considered "neutral."

Considering the results of calculating the critical Reynolds number of a laminar

boundary layer on an elastic surface (5 11.6), we arrive at the conclusion that the
greatest effect can be achieved by controlling the boundary layer uning an active
covering (caz-e "a"). For the majority of shift angles characteristic of a "passive"
covering, the critical Reynolds number decreases. There is adefined range of shift
angles provided by a passive covering where the critical Reynolds nuﬁer increases.

the function U'(r). The corresponding curves are illustrated in Pigure 11.1.2. The
distribution of the radii r(x) with respect to length of the invesEigatsd bodies is

§ 11.9. Sone Structural Diagrams ofFlexible Coverings Designed to Extinguish Pulsa-
tions in a Boundary Layer

Kramer obtained his first results with respect to reducing the drag of bodies nov—
ing in water using the so-called "columnar covering," the structural design of which
appears in Figure 11.21. Silicone fluid with different kinematic viscosity was used
as the filler. Figure 11.22 shows the results of testing a model described in § 11.1
with different versions of the columnar covering. Curve 1 corresponds to the fric-
tional drag of the model for a completely turbulent flow condition in the boundary
layer. Curve L corresponds to completely laminar flow in the boundary layer.

Curve 1 was obtained for a covering made of rubber with rigidity of 15.8 Its/cs3 and
filled with a fluid having a viscosity of 400 centiatohes. Curve 2 corresponds to
a covering with rigidity of 44.3 kg/cn filled with a viscosity of 1200 centistokes.
Curve 3 corresponds to a covering with rigidity 22.2 kg/cn3 filled with a fluid

with viscosity of 300 centistokes. Curve 8 gives a representation of the drag of

an absolutely rigid standard under similar test conditions.

A structural design that is easier to put together for damping coverings tested by
Kroner appears in Figure [1.23. The test results are presented in Figure 11.22 in

the fern of curve 4. As Kramer notes [3]. this design allowed for nsintaining
damping properties of the covering over a prolonged period of time at the some tine
as the properties of "colunnar coverings" changed in a negative direction during
prolonged storage for unknown reasons.

Kramer proposed several structural designs of damping coverings (Figure 11.26, 11.25).
The cosplexity of manufacturing them differs. However. cannon features include the

Apparently the sinplest structural design is a three-layer covering (Figure 11.26)
consisting of a base. porous filler (sponge rubber. foan polyurethane) impregnated
with a fluid with the corresponding viscosity and upperflexibh diaphragn.

By varying the filler porosity. the fluid viscosity and pressure under which the
fluid operates in the coating. it is possible to vary the damping characteristics

of the investigated design.

CHAPTER III. INFLUENCE OF VARIATIOS OF THE PHYSICAL COGSIANTS OF A FLUID (l
STABILITY OF AN INCOHPRBSSIBLE LAMINAR BOUNDARY LAYER

5 111.1. Statement of the Problem. Equations of Motion of an Inhomogeneous Viscous
Fluid

The equations of motion and the continuity equation of an inhosogeneous into-pres-
sible fluid are written in the form of expressions (I.l)-(I.3).

1n equations (1.l)-(I.3) the fluid density p and viscosity u will he considered the
variables which depend on the space coordinates. Considering the study of fluid
flows in a boundary layer where variation of all of the variables with respect to

the v-coordinate is appreciably greater than with respect to the x-coordinate, let
us *et

9 a My). 9 = Mal (111.1)

uhere v - u/p - v(y). In order to discover the basic physical lass connected with
variability of the fluid properties in the boundary layer. it is expedient to con-
sider the relations 0(y) and v(y) given. The methods of creating inhomogeneity in
the fluid boundary layer leading to specific definition of the indicated functions
are not considered in this section.

This approach greatly simplifies the problss, for it eliminates the necessity for
joint solution of the equations of hydrodynamics and equations characterizing the
material or heat transfer in the boundary layer. Possible inexactness connected

with noncorrespondence of the assumed functions v(y), p(y) to the real functions
obtained in each specific problem do not turn out to be significant, for the pur-

pose of this chapter is to discover qualitative laws and indicate the possible
order of magnitudes.

1n the adopted statement, the fluid density is a function of the coordinates of a

point in space. Therefore let us introduce the gravitational force acting on a
unit volume of the fluid into the investigation

The gravitational acceleration vector 3 has the projections g:. gy, g2. Consider-
ing (111.1), (111.2), the equations of action are urittsn as follows:

The systes of equations (111.3) together with the continuity equation (1.2) will be
the basis for studying the characteristics of a laminar boundary layer in an inhoso-
geneous fluid.

Restriction of the problen to only lasinar flow in a layer is connected with the
fact that creation of inhomogeneity of the fluid in the wall region is used for
laminarization of the flow in the boundary layer. The control of a turbulent boun-
dary layer is the subject of the following sections of this paper.

In order to discover the conditions of maintaining the laminar form of flow in an
inhomogeneous boundary layer, it is necessary to solve two problems successively.
The first is determination of the characteristics of the laminar boundary layer in

an inhomogeneous fluid for given laws of variation of p(y). v(y). The second is to
study the stability of a laminar boundary layer with velocity profile in an inhomo-
geneous fluid obtained as a result of solving the first probles. For qualitative
discovery of the basic laws of the influence of inhomogeneity of the fluid on the
stability of a laminar fluid flow in a boundary layer and also simplify the problem.
the case of variable density p - p(y). v - const and the case of variable kinematic
viscosity v - v(y), p - count will be investigated separately below.

5 111.2. Laminar Boundary Layer in an lncospressible Liquid with Variable Kinematic
Viscosity

Flaws of the boundary layer type in an incompressible fluid with variable kinesatic
viscosity have been investigated both by Soviet authors [l]-[7] and foreign authors
[8]-[lb]. References [ll-[3], [8]-[10] study a laminar boundary layer in the
presence of a kinematic viscosity gradient in the well region. In references [6]-
[7], [Ill-[lb] studies are made of flows in tubes and channels. The methods of
solving the system of equations for a boundary layer in the indicated papers are
divided into two groups. The first group includes approximate methods [1], [2],
[8]. [10]; the second can include the methods of numerical integration [7]. [3],
[9]. The authors of all the enumerated papers relate the kinematic viscosity dis-
tribution in the boundary layer to the fluid temperature variation across the flow
which greatly complicates the problem. The studies [2], [8] were performed by the
Pohlhausen method using a third-degree polynomial. The problea was stated as in
references [15], [16].

In this section the Pohlhausen nethod is used. but approximation of the velocities
in the boundary layer is nade using the fourth-degree polynomial. In addition,
calculated formulas were obtained for a flow with gradient velocity on the outer
boundary of the boundary layer which, with respect to structure, correspond to the

known Loytsyanskiy-Val'ts formulas. being a generalization of them to the case of
variable kinematic viscosity.

The system of Prandtl equations obtained on the basis of (111.3) in the investigated
case has the form

The influence of gravity is not taken into account, for the corresponding tern can
be conbined with a tern characterizing the pressure gradient along the surface
over which the flow takes place. tor specific definition of the function v - v(y)

where v0 is the viscosity of the onconing flow;

is represented for different values of the parameter I in Pigure 111.1.

For solution of the problen let us use the Pohlhaussn nethod [l7]. that is. we
assume that the velocity distribution in the boundary layer can be represented in
the fern of the polynomial

§ 111.3. Laminar Boundary Layer in a Fluid with Variable Density

Let us consider the two-dimensional, steady-state boundary layer under the assump-
tion that 3x - 0, gy - —g. where g is a gravitational acceleration. The

systm of equations of the boundary layer obtained on the basis of (111.3) is written
as follows:

It must be emphasized that the continuity equation (1.2) for an incompressible fluid
has the above-indicated form in spite of the dependence of the density on the space

point coordinates (see [28], Chapter 1).

Defining the pressure gradient along the flow from the condition of validity of the
first equation of (111.25) at the upper boundary of the boundary layer. we arrive at
the expression

where 9* - 0(6).

For solution of the problem. just as in § 111.2, we use the Pohlhaueen method. The
velocity profile in the boundary layer will be approximated by the polynomial (111.6),

the coefficients of which will be determined free the conditions (111.7), (111.9)

the value of Ball/8x in the right-hand side of (111. 6). and then let us integrate
both sides of the equality with respect to the y-coordinate within the limits of the

boundary layer. Considering the continuity equation, we obtain the followiu inte-

In this section a study is made of the influence of the variability of the Itinenatic
viscosity on boundary layer stability with respect to ‘rollnisn-Bchlichting waves.

No approaches to studying the development of disturbances in an inhomogeneous fluid
are possible. On the one hand. it is possible to seems that the displacussnt of
the fluid particles causes no change in the distribution p(y).v (y), that is. the
velocity pulsations are not accompanied by pulsations of p and v. This will occur
if s fluid particle characterized by values of pl. v1 incident in the layer with
defined values of v2. 0 instantaneously changes its properties so that v becones
equal to v2 and, respec ively.p acquires a value of 02.

On the other hand. it is possible to consider that a fluid particle sowing froa layer
1 to layer 2 conpletely retains the properties which it had in layer 1. Here the

velocity pulsations essentially cause pulsations of the values of v and p.

In reality. obviously the phenonenon develops by some internediate scheme, for on ‘
displacement in an inhomogeneous fluid the particle changes its properties. The
degree of approxination of the process to the first or second scheme depends on

the rate of these variations.

Studies of disturbances in a fluid that is inhomogeneous with respect to kimstic
viscosity, discussed below, have the first scbese as their basis.

Using (111.3), let us write the system of equations of disturbing motion of a fluid
with constant density for the twocdinenaional case,not considering the influence of
ease forces.

in the flow stability in the case of a negative density gradient (3 > 0) in the well

Reynolds stresses discussed in § 1.3. Hith negative density gradient the nagnitude

51v.1. Similar Solutions of the Laminar Bomdary Layer Equations in the Presence

Solutions of the laminar boundary layer equations which define the longitudinal
velocity conponent profiles having similarity properties, that is, for each cross
section of the boundary layer there is a characteristic linear dilension and
characteristic velocity such that the dimensionless profile obtained with their
help is identical for all cross sectiomof the layer. are called similar.

The system of equations of a two-dimensional steady-stats boundary layer in dimen-
sional form is described on the basis of (1.18) as follows:

The procedure for describing the last of the boundary conditions (IVA) is of a
somewhat formal nature, for equation (IV. 3) itself correctly reflects the motion
of the fluid only in the wall region and. generally speaking. it is impossible to
consider its solution for you. However, the calculations for the special cases of
flow with boundary conditions (IVJo) give satisfactory correspondence to the
experimental results, which is the basis for the application of the methods of an

asymptotic boundary layer in practical applications of the nthods in which the
condition for y-N- is used.

Finding similar solutions, according to the definition let us introduce [1] func-
tions 6(x) and 9(n) such that

an inperneable surface are widely known ad are put in the najority of nonographs
on boundary layers [3], [6], [5]. Integration of the bomdary layer equations
for a porous surface in the. case of then“ is presented in references [13], [52].
The problem of studying similar solutions of the boundary layer equations are
investigated in the studies [61-[8]. [S8]. A broad bibliography of papers on
similar solutions of a laminar bomdary layer with suction appears in the nono-
graph [3]. N. I. Pol'skiy [53] studied sililer solutions of boundary layer equa-
tions written in Hines form. and he detected that classes of sieilar solutions of

the Mises equation exist only for the velocity distributions of the external flow
for which similar solutions of Prandtl equations occur.

SIV.2. Use of Pulse and Energy Equations for Approximate Calculation of a
Boundary Layer with Suction or 'Blowing.

In practical calculations of the boundary layer characteristics it is usually
necessary to deal with hidily varied velocity distribution laws at their outer
boundary. The developed calculation schemes can be divided into three groups.
The first group includes methods of numerical integration of the Prandtl control
system. The application of numerical integration to the problem of boundary
layer control using suction is discussed in ”v.9. The second group enconpasses
the cathode connected with expansion of the velocity at the outer boundary of the
layer in a series with respect to the variable which depenb on the longitudinal
coordinate [9], [10]. The desired function at which ﬁnally the current function
is taken is also expanded in an analogou series, but with coefficients that
depend on the transverse coordinate in the boundary layer. Using the system of
equations (IV.l). the set of differential relations is obtained from which variable
coefficients in a series which represents the desired solution are determined
considering the bomdary conditions. The cowlexity of the method consists in
weak convergence of the series and the necessity of tabulating a large meter of
auxiliary functions. Recently. Coertler [ll], [12] proposed modified series for
solution of the problem which have better convergence. but. as before, require
calculation of a significant nulber of auxiliary functions.

It is possible to consider approximate methods based on the application of
integral relations of the bomdary layer in the third group. Beginning with the
known Karman-Pohlhausen method, the integral relations found broad application in
practical calculations of the boundary layer, and they are used in) to the present
time.

Let us consider the case of axisys-etric flow over a body of rotation, the radius
of which to is appreciably larger that the thickness of the boundary layer. Using
the ordinary assumptions adopted in boundary layer theory. the equations for an
axisymtric flow can be written in the following for: [5]:

For suction vo-v(x, 0)<0. Equations (IV.37). (IV.38) can be obtained by applying
the laws of conservation of momentum and energy to an element of the boundary layer
on a permeable surface. For k>l the integral relations (IV.7.5) do not have an
obvious physical interpretation.

For approximate calculation of a laminar boundary layer with an arbitrary velocity
distribution law on its outer boundary, the integral relations of the pulses (137.37)

are used independently [161-[19] or jointly with the energy equation (IV.38\ [20]-
[23].

The basic idea of these methods consists in using the approximate aingle-paraaetric
family of profiles to approximate the velocity profiles in the boundary layer

cross sections. Variation of the family parameter permits us to create a variety
of shapes of profiles required for approximate description of the velocity distribu-
tion in the homdnry layer. A survey of the single-parameteric methods is con-
tained in the monograph M]. It is possible to find a specific calculation system
from the standard single-paramtric Karman-i’ohlhausen112mml in 5111.1-

In conclusion, let us note that the set of Golubev integral relations cannot be
considered from the point of View of their use in the sense of the mthod of
successive approximations [lo]. All of them, beginning with k-Z. were obtained
essentially by a formal procedure, and therefore they do not contain additional
information about the fluid flow in a boundary layer. Cmsequently, using several
integral relations in the boundary layer calculatims, it is possible to obtain
results that diverge with reality more than the data based on the application of
only one pulse equation k=0.

5mm. Use of a System of Three Equations of lbments for Approximte Calculation
of a Laminar Bomdary Layer

The existing methods of approximate integration of the equations of a laminar
boundary layer on a porom surface are based on ming the pulse equation or on
joint application of the pulse and energy equations. The accuracy of these

methods depends to a significant degree on successful approximation of the velocity
profile across the boundary layer. For exeqle, the velocity profile proposed in
reference [16] very approximately reflects the effective variation of the veloci-
ties in the boundary layer on a porous surface, especially near the layer separa-
tion point. The use of a fourth degree polynomial also in this one leads to
errors in calculating the boundary layer characteristics [17].

As was demonstrated in reference [26], by wing the system of equations of "moments"
of the basic differential equation of the bomdary layer md applying sinle
families of velocity profiles. it is possible to develop an entirely satisfactory
mthod of integrating the equations of a laminar boundary layer c.-. an inermeable
surface. In this section. a system of three equations of "moments" is med for
approximate integration of equations (IV.l) of the laminar boundary layer on a
porous surface in the presence of auction in an incompressible fluid [25].

For a body vith porous surface the investigated system of differential equations
must satisfy the following bomdary conditions:

§IV.7. Approximate Method of Calculating a Laminar Boundary Layer in the Presence
of Slot Suction

The existing methods of calculating a laminar boundary layer with fluid suction
through transverse slots located on the surface of the body are based on the prop-

osition that suction does not change the pressure distribution on the outer
boundary of the boundary layer.

An approximate method of calculating a laminar boundary layer on a plate with
slot suction was proposed for the first til: by Huest [39]. The procedure is based
on the application of a single-parametric fanily of profiles

u r Fm. K).

where k is the fora parameter, n-y/d.md also on joint me of pulse and energy
equations.

A very simple mthod of calculating the pulse loss thickness for a laminar
boundary layer with suction through transverse slots was proposed by c. Lachnann
[40]. For calculation of 6” in the profile between the slots 5.15535), let us

Let (GM/l.)n be the ratio of the pulse loss thickness to the length of a body on
reaching the n-th slot. As a result of suction..this ratio dacreuea to a value
of (on/0'“. During the development process, the pulse loss thickness behind the

slot increases again and reaches a value of (6**/L)n+1 at the n+1 slot.

According to Lachnann. from the condition of transition of a luminary boundary layer
to turbulent, we limit the value of the critical Reynolds nmer constructed by

the pulse loss thickness to a value of Reg -1250.

it is possible to find the profile after the slot, dropping the lower part of the
profile before the slot through which the fluid is sucked at a distance y fro-
the surface. The area of the dropped part of the slot corresponds to the smunt

51V. 8. Determination of the Elements of a Slot Suction Systen Insuring Boundary
Layer Laninariaation

The optimal removal of fluid fron a boundary layer is distributed suction throuﬁ:

a porous surface. with corresponding mothness and porosity of the surface. this
organization of fluid removal introduces the lent disturbances into the boundary
layer and. acting continuomly on the flow along its entire surface, it creates

the most favorable flow stdailizatim conditions. However. for a nutter of process
reasons, the most inortant of vhich is danger of rapid clogging of the pores mder
actual operating conditions. in contrast to discrete. primarily slot auction.
distributed suction still has not fond practical application for boundary layer
laminarizetion purposes.

For slot suction, the slot width must be selected quite snall so that the surface
rougmess will not exceed a defined level. for the edges of the slot play the role
of disturbance sources in the £100: even when they do not protrude above the sur-
face. Snell slot width with defined flow rate through the entire surface imlies
relatively large local fluid flow velocities in the slot by coaparison with dis-
tributed suction. Therefore. by using the apparatus of boundary layer theory
based on the proposition of snallness of transverse velocities. it appears possible
to determine the flow characteristics near the slot.

The indicated facts give rise to an anpirical nature of all of the existing calcu-
lation methods of determining the para-stars of slot suction system. A discussion
is presented below of an approximate method developed by Yu. N. Alekseyev.
Calculation practice shows that for longitudinalflou over syrstric wings and
axisymetric elongated bodies with Reynolds nudaers not/11:11.10 the inﬂuence of
individual form of the body on the anount of sucked fluid and location of the
slots is small. The obtained nuaber of slots and sucked fluid flow rates
required for boundary layer lsminariaation differ little from the corresponding
values for a plate with longitudinal flow over it. Consequently, for approxilnte
estimation of the paraneters of the suction system for wings and bodies of revolu-
tion, it is possible to me the relations obtained for a plate.

the slot, which is defined as the difference dim-63*, where 63* is the pulse loss

5iV.9. Numerical Integration of the Equations of Motion of a Fluid in a
Laminar Boundary Layer with Suction '

The methods of calculating a laminar boundary layer investigated in SIV.2-IV.4

and based on the application of integral relations and a set of boundary conditions,
offer the possibility of comparatively quickly calculating the desired layer
characteristics for distributed suction on bodies of revolution .and profiles. How-
ever, the accuracy of the calculation is in this case limited by a nuﬂaer of
specific assumptions and forced mathematical simplifications. Bxasplea of such
assumptions. in particular, are to a known degree the subjective assimptions of

the possibility of representing the velocity profile or tangential stresses in the
form of a fmction of one or several paramters and the mthod of approximating it.
Using the methods of calculating a laminar boundary for discrete suction, it must
be noted that the assumptions on which they are based are still mre approximate.
Therefore, for comparative estimation of the quality of different calculation
methods and degree of reliability of the results obtained by them, experimental

and theoretical checking are required. Inasmuch as the experimntal data on a
sucked laminar boundary layer are eager and basically are of a qualitative nature,
a great deal of significance is attached to the possibility of theoretical analysis,
for which primarily the methods of numerical integration of the equations of nation
of a fluid in a laminar boundary layer can be used.

It is known that the equations of a laminar boundary layer are among the parabolic
type equations of mathematical physics. It is possible to obtain the solution to
these equations in quadratures only in individual special cases. for exasple, in
the case of an asynptotic boundary layer with miform auction on a plate. As for
solutions obtained using series, according to the evidence of Schlichting [3],

this calculation of the boundary layer is in the majority of cases highly complex,
tedious, and it cannot be performed with admissible expenditure of time in practice.

The numerical method of integration which is called the "continuation method" in
some papers on boundary-layer theory makes it possible for us to obtain solutions
which are more accurate than the solutions using series. and this numerical inte-
gration method has been adapted well for computer use. The development of the
methods of numerical integration of the boundary layer equations have attracted

the attention of a number of researchers (Prandtl. Goldstein. Schroeder. Goertler,
Hitting, Reinboidt in the German Democratic Republic and Federal Republic of Germany.
Hartree. Homersly. Manogar. Smith and Clutter in the United States and A. A.
Dorodnitsyyn in the USSR).

Among the German papers. the following are of practical interest: the paper by
Goertler llol] on the application of the finite-difference method of numerical
integration to the laminar boundary layer equations for an impermeable surface and
the paper by Hitting [42] which introduces corrections into the Goertler method.
Generalization of reference [61] to the case of auction was accomplished by
Reinboldt [1.3]. The primary content of his research was determination of the
variation of the flow characteristics at the boundary condition discontinuity points
on the wall. The data on the effect of suction on a laminar baundary layer were
also obtained by numerical integration by Smith and Clutter [44].

In addition, the velocity profile is given in the initial cross section :1 of

into k parts with atepsize l. The set of nodes tornad on intersection of the
straight lines at - ih (i - 0.1. 2.... ) and y - 1:1 (It - 0, l. 2. ...) is a rectangu-

The structure of formula (H.156) is such that the values-of A1 calculated by it
are calculated successively. beginning with the layer k-l, for (km-0), as a result
of the presence in the numerator (H.156) of a suby the index v assuming values

fron l to k-l. Prom the boundary conditions it follows that at the nodes two.

In addition, inasluch as the initial velocity profile is considered given at the
nodes i-l; k-0,1.2..... the values are knowu

“I. - ”a (a. .L,.,- m. 158)

Thus. the problen of integratinnof the boundary layer equations is reduced to a
purely algebraic problem of solving a system of "explicit finite-difference"

equations (H.156) considering (H.157) and (H.158) with an error called the
"approximation error."

The calculated values of A k'“1+1 k’"i k are the velocity increaents in layers with
the index k on transition rotn crdss section 1 to cross section 1+1. Consequently,
if the velocity profile is given in the initial cross section, it is possible to
calculate the velocity profile in the slbsequent cross section downstream. that is,
it is possible to calculate the deformation of the velocity profile during the pro-
cess of development of a laminar boundary layer and all of its characteristics:
integral thicknesses, fora pat-enter. frictional stress at the wall.

It Inst be noted that expression (H.156) has a significant deficiency which does
not per-it its use to calculate the velocity incrennt for snall k-l, 2. Pros
analysis of this expression it is possible to conclude that the value of y exists
(in practice within the limits of the first layer) for which indeterminacy of the
type of 0/0 arises in equation (H.156). This fact leads to significant calcula-
tion errors A k for k-l.2 and forces us to resort to special aethods of obtaining
more exact calculation formulas for the layers closest to the well. For 192,
expression (H.156) is applicable without any stipulations.

The mentioned formulas for k-l, 2 were obtained in Uitting's paper [62] in the case
of iwermable surfaces; the method of successive approximations for calculating
the velocity increment by these foraulas is also discussed there.

Yu. N. Karpeyev generalized the Hitting method to the case of arbitrary boundary
conditions on the wall. This generalized method was used to investigate the develop- .
tent of a landnar boundary layer on a plate on transition from the iwernssble

section of surface to a permeable section through which distributed suction is

uniformly performd. In order to get around the difficulties connected with the
presence of a normal velocity discontinuity at the wall, a suction lav shown in
Figure H.25 was adopted. The values of u*.-7 Ilsac, L~0.5 m were taken as the
characteristic velocity and length; here, lie-2.5405. The dimensionless suction

" — ”o
velocity was taken as ”- =' Tin/Re "' “2.5 (7' =0.005). and the cell dimensions

tangential stress on the wall is presented, and the step distribution h is indi-
cated. The results of the Reinboldt [43], Smith and Clutter [166] calculations are
presented there also. The nature of deformation of the velocity profile in the
calculated exanple (vo-02.S) is explained in Figure IV.27, where it is possible to
trace a gradual transition from the Blasius profile to the asyaptotic velocity
profile. It is of interest that the suction effect is first manifested in the wall
region, and then it is propagated to greater distances from the wall on going down-
stream.

Figure IV.25. Distribution of suction velocity in the calculated
examle

It was noted above that the application of the nethoda of nunerical integration
permits investigation of the development of a laminar boundary layer for arbitrary
suction laws and, in particular, discrete auction with precision not available to
approximate methods based on using integral relations. One such problem is the
problem of the boundary layer with uniform suction through a short permeable sec-
tion simulating a slot. The results of the Reinholdt, Smith and Clutter calcula-
tions illustrating the process of layer development on transition through a
permeable section 1.0<xsl.l$ in length (suction velocity vo—l.$) are depicted in
Figure IV.28. By variation of the values proportional to the displacement thick-
ness and tangential stress in the vicinity of the slot and after it, it is possible
to judge the intensity of the development of slot suction. At some quite large
distance downstream by comparison with the slot width, the velocity profile
approaches the Blasius profile. but the boundary layer thicknesses and tangential
stresses are not restored to values which would occur in the absence of discrete
suction.

Application of the A. A. Dorodnitayn Method for Calculating a Controlled L-inar
Boundary Layer

The original method of numerical solution of the laminar boundary layer equations
was proposed by A. A. Dorodnitsyn [59]. This anthod allows the solution to be
found to the specific problem of calculating the laminar boundary parameters with
any degree of accuracy using high-speed computers.

The A. A. Dorodnitsyn calculation nthod is discussed below for a more general case
of a laminar boundary layer when fluid is either injected or sucked out.

Let us first transform the initial system of laminar boundary layer equations
(IV.l) to dimensionless form, introducing the following expressions:

In accordance with A. A. Dorodnitsyn, we now obtain integral relations of a
general type for the system (IV.162) and (IV.163), analogously to how this is done
for the nontransforned system. For this purpose let us multiply equation (IV.163)
by an arbitrary function f(u). equation (IV.162) by f'(u). and let us add then.
Then we have

The arbitrary function f(u) must satisfy only one condition, that it approach zero

The ventilation law (Iv.l76) gives physically real results only for n<l and,
correspondingly, for 8<l.

For vo-O. from the above-presented formulas, the results of A. A. Dorodnitsyn are
obtained.

The investigated case of 0-1:“ permits investigation of the problem of converpnce
of successive approximations and scmracy of the spproxiute system. The calcula-
tions performed by A. A. Dorodnitsyn for an moontolled laminar boundary layer
demnstrated that the third approximation gives satisfactory results, especially
far fron separation. Therefore it is possible to state that when solving the

problem of suction of a laminar bomdary layer, the accuracy of the approximate
system increases simificantly.

In accordance with the recommendations of A. A. Dorodnitayn for an arbitrary
velocity law 0(5) the solutions of the type of (H.175) can be used as initial
values for 6k which permit us to depart free the singular point {-0 and then apply

any methods of numerical integration of the systems of ordinary differential
equations.

layer characteristics.

“.1. Theory of Laminar Bomdary Layer Transition to Turbulent Under the Bffect
of Initial Flow Turbulence

The existing methods of determining the transition point can be divided into two
groups.

The first group includes cumin-ice! asthods based on the results of statistical
processing of the experimental data. In these aathods the influence of the initial
turbulence of an external flow on transition of the la-inar boundary layer to

turbulent is for the most part considered in iqlidt form. Surveys of this type
of research Qpear in references [27]. [28].

The second group combines semi-eqirical mathoch, vhich include the known methods
of A. A. Dorodnitsyn and L. G. Loytsyanakiy [l], A. P. Hsl'niltov [2],
Van-Drist and Bloomer [32]. These methods permit consideration of the effect of

the initial turbulence in an external flow on the extent of the laminar section in
the bomdary layer.

The basis for semi-emiricsl aethods is the proposition that the cause of occurrence
of turbulence in a laminar boundary layer under the effect of external disturbances
in eddies. These eddies are generated near the surface of the body as a result of
instantaneous local separations of the laainsr layer formed as a result of pressure
disturbances in the external flow. The idea of such a mechanism of influence of
finite-amlitude external disturbances on transition of s luinar boundary layer
to turbulent was apparently first stated by ‘l'aylor [3]. Espirical studies [lo]

have demonstrated that this transition lechanisn in a boundary layer occurs only
for initial turbulence of the flow, the degree of vhich exceeds 0.1 to 0.22. The
indicated scheme for the occurrence of a lalinar boundary layer transition to
turbulent pernits an equation to be written for determining the transition point.

In order to explain the basic principles of the seni-erpirical trmsition theory
let us discuss the nethod of A. A. Dorodnitsyn and 1.. G. Loytsynskiy [30] for
calculating the transition point. lat ll consider the condition of occurrence of
separation in a laminar boundary layer which is written in the form [22]

The separating laminar flow has significantly less stﬁility by culparison with
the laminar boundary layer [28]; therefore in direct proximity to the separation
point turbulent motion of the fluid sets up. It is expedient to rewrite the

disturbances of the external flow velocity. Smell random nonsteady disturbances
can noticeably influence the dimensionless paranter vU'le, changing it on the
average by de fined anount 7 having negative sigiificance so that the boundary layer
separation will be shifted upstrean. The indicated fact is explained in that the
spatial frequency of the disturbances can be so rest that the derivative of the
longitudinal velocity of the disturbing mtion Id: can be of the same order as
11'. Thus. the condition of occurrence of separation of a lusinar boundary layer
mder the effect of tendon disturbances can be written as follows:

The value of f3 and also the constants in the formula for d“ can be somhat

In particular. the rethod of A. H. Basin [20] gives a value of f.-0.077 for the
fore parameter at the separation point. The dimensionless values are denoted by
a bar at the top.

If the velocity distribution at the external boundary of the layer is known. the
values of y and Re. then, constructing the graph of the lgfthand side of formula
(v.1). it is possible to find a dinensionless coordinate x for which equality
(v.1) occurs. This will be the transition point of the laminar boundary layer to
turbulent. It is necessary to determine the value of y in the discmesd method on
the basis of analyzing the experimental data.

Using the Taylor hypothesis [3]. it is possible to establish the relation of y to
the turbulence characteristics of the external flov. For this purpose let us
rewrite the basic equation for detersining the coordinate of the separation point

in the following dimensionless form

difficulties arise in selecting the value of the parneter yo characterised. in

disturbances in the external flow. However. Ye. n. Hinskiy [29] denonstrated

experinentally that the paramter Y depends also on the longitudinal pressure
gradient at the outer boundary of t e boundary layer.

Let us proceed with the discussion of a somewhat different method of determining
the critical Reynolds nutter at the trmition point [6]. As before. we shall
consider that turbulence in the boundary layer occurs under the effect of finite-
amplitude disturbances camed by eddies generated at the surface of the body and
formed as a result of local separations of the boundary layer. In the investigated

case, finite disturbances are introduced into the bomdary layer by turbulence of
the oncoming flow.

The dependence of the critical Reynolds mater for a plate on the degree of

The calculated and experimental values of the local critical Reynolds numbers at
the transition point as a fmction of the degree of turbulence of the oncoming flow
were compared in Figure v.1. (see formula v.12). Considering the dispersion of the
experimental points, it is possible to recognise the cowarison as entirely satis-
factory with the exception of the segment of the curve corresponding to an insig-
nificmt (no more than 0.12) degree of turbulence of the oncoming flow. The reason
for the divergences in this case is unauitability of the transition scheme used

in this section for very small velocity disturbances introduced into the boundary
layer by turbulence of the oncoming flow.

It is of interest to note that comsrison of the data obtained with the graphs for
calculating the transition point proposed in references [Bl-[10] indicates
correspondence of the lentioned graphs to formula (v.11) for c-0.15 to 0.352.

This fact is an additional confirmation of correctness of formula (v.11) inumuch
as the experimental data used for cupsrison of these graphs were obtained in the
indicated range of the degree of turbulence of the oncoming flow.

5V.2. Influence of Surface Roughness on the laminar Boundary Layer Transition
to Turbulent

One of the basic factors defining the position of the transition point of a laminar
boundary layer to turbulent is surface roughness of the body. Accordingly.

studies aimed at investigating the effect of roughness on turbulisation of the
boundary layer have significant theoretical mud practical interest.

The study of the effect of roughness on the lusinar boundary layer transition to
turbulent is found in a large umber of experimental papers. 3. Dryden [ll].
classifying his experimental results, arrived at the conclmion that the ratio

of the critical Reynolds mater at the transitim point for a rough plate to the
corresponding value for a smooth plate is a "universal function" of the ratio of
the height of a roughness element to the pulse loss thickness or the displaceunt

flow at the location of the roud'lness element. Universality of the mentioned
function consists in its independence of the initial turbulence of the oncoming
flow. A coaparison [12] of the "universal function" with the experimental data of
Peindt [7] obtained on a setup with large initial flow turbulence did not oonfirn
Dryden's preposition. We also arrive at an analogous conclusion when analyzing
the experimental results of Japanese researclers [13], [14]. Accordingly. uhen
determining the influence of rougxness on the laminar boundary layer transition to
turbulent. Dryden's "universal function" must be used with caution. Nevertheless,
this function is widely used in aerodynamic calculations, for example, in the
calculation technique proposed by C. Lachunn [15].

A nonuniform flow caused by the stagnadng effect of the fluid viscosity near the
body surface hits a roughness element located in the boundary layer. By the
effect on the roughness element, it is possible approximately to replace the non-
uniforn flow in a boundary layer by a uniform flow with an average velocity.
Analysis of the experimental data of [11], [7], [13], [14]. [l6], [17], [33]
demonstrated that the roughness element becomes the cause of premature turbuliss-
tion of the boundary layer.when the Reynolds nuber constructed by the average
velocity and height of the roughness elenent is greater than 10-40. After circular
cylinders and other poorly streamlined bodies in a miforn flow. when the mentioned
hynolds nudaers are reached, a Benard-Karman vortex sheet is formed. Accord-
insl)’. it is possible to assume that flow over a roughness element is also
accoapanied by periodic vortex formation. As a result of the shielding effect of
the body surface, after the roughness element a vortex chain nut be formed. and
not the vortex sheet as in the case of unlimited flow over a circular cylinder.

Experiments in visual representation of the flow in the boundary layer by dyed
stream confirmed this proposition [17]. After passage by a two-dimensional rough-c
ness element located on a plate. the dyed stress: of fluid twists into rectilinear
vortex plaits. Then. from the individual vortex plaits formed periodically on flow
over a roughness element, a vortex chain is formed. At a significant distance from
the roughness element. the vortex plait assume a sawtooth shape with clearly
expressed periodicity in the transverse direction.

Passage of a vortex chain nust cause periodic velocity pulsations in the boundary
layer. which influence the velocity redistribution across the layer and also
obviously serve as a source of turbulent disturbances in the layer. The velocity
profile in a bomdary layer in the absence of a roughness elemnt (l) is depicted
shematicslly in Figure v.5. As a result of the disturbing effect of the vortex
plaits, the velocity profile acquires the shape denoted by 2 at some point in time.
and the state of the boundary layer becomes close to preeeparstion. Then the pre-
maturely separated laminar layer decomposes into individual vortices and becomes
turbulent. Schematizing the flow in this way, it is possible to see a direct
relation between premature separation of a laminar boundary layer and transition
of the laminar layer to turbulent caused by a roughness elesent.

This schemtization of the flow permits generalization of Taylor's hypothesis
regarding the mechanism of transition of the laminar boundary layer to turbulent

to the investigated case of a rough surface. The mentioned hypothesis was formu-
lated by Taylor [3] when studying the effect of the initial turbulence of a flow
on the transition of a laninar layer to turbulent.

Figure v.5. Diagram of the transition of a laminar bomdary layer
to turbulent after a single roughness element

In the majority of cases the transition of a laminar layer to turbulent is simul-
taneously influenced by the initial turbulence and the surface roughness. In
this section we shall limit ourselves to studying the effect of roughness on the
laminar layer transition to turbulent. This approach has practical significance
for low-turbulent flows (less than 0.1-0.21). ,

For determination of the conditions of local separation we shall use fonaula (v.6).

A turbulent flow foraed as a result of the fornation of vorticea on the roudmess
element will be considered isotropic. Then. wing the results of statistical turb-
ulence theory [3]. let us apply the first for-ula of (v.5).

Inasmuch as the fornation of vortices on flow around a roughness is taken a the
only came of premature transition of a laninar boundary layer to turbulent in this
section. the size of the "least vortex" in formula (v.5) will be taken as a value
proportional to the height of the roughness elennt. that is. Al'd. where d is the
roughness eleaent height.

where r is the circulation of a vortex separating fro- the mudtneas element.

a. Schlichting [18] demonstrated that flow over a roughness element located in the

with a velocity equal to the corresponding value in the bomdary layer at a mud:-
ness elemnt height in place of the location of the roughness elemt. Taking
this into accomt. in the investigated case it is possible to write that the
circulation of a vortex formed on flow aromd a roughness clennt

The values of the lower critical Reynolds nullaers for different pressure gradients

this value.

It nust be noted that the constant A1 in fornula (V. 18) is the only value which
cannot be determined theoretically. Cowarison and analysis of the calculated

51-70 to m.

known experimental data of [11], [7], [13], [14]. The cowarison results which

dence of formula (v.18) to the experiuntal data.

In the proposed theory it was considered that the only cause of premature
transition is surface roughness. Therefore it is natural that comparison of the
theoretical and experimental data (Figure v.6) turned out to be better, the smaller
the initial turbulence of the flow.

Let us consider a special case of laminar boundary layer transition on a plate
under the effect of roughness which is of inortance for practical applications.
The calculations by formula (v.18) for this case (f-O) allowed the graphical rela-
tion (Figure v.7) for the local critical Reynolds number of the transition Uxt/V
to be obtained as a function of the Reynolds nunber lelv constructed by the
velocity of the oncoming flow and the distance of a single roughness element from
the forward edge x1.

The proposed diagram makes it possible to solve various practical problem. From
the presented graph, in particular. it follows that the transition of a laminar
boundary layer to turbulent will take place directly after a single roughness

element (xt-xl) if

This formula permits determination of the height of a single roughness element, for
which at the given flow velocity the transition of the laminar boundary layer to
turbulent takes place directly after the roughness elsmnt.

Figure v.8 shews the coupsrison of the calculation results by formulas (v.20) (the
solid line) and (v.21) (the dotted line with the corresponding experimental data
of Fage [16] and Japanese researchers [13], [14] (noted by the circles). These
data confirm the correctness of the proposed formula (V.20),and they agree with
the theoretical results obtained in reference [21].

Practical calculation of the transition point for a body of given shape and known
surface roughness consists in calculation of the local Reynolds nuliaer Re** and
also the parameters f and d/d** for a laminar layer as a function of the coordinate
x reckoned from the forward chtical point along the lines of the body. It is
possible to calculate the characteristics of the laminar boundary layer by ordinary
m‘tlmds [22]. Values of the critical Reynolds nunber Re** are determined for the
calculated parsmters by formula (v.18). and the equation of the type of (v.13) is
solved graphically. The root of this equation is the transition point coordinate.

The papers that study the influence of various types of surface mudmeas on the
transition are finding broad application in model experineats in the mdel testing
basins. Small Reynolds nuﬂaers by comparison with the full-scale units lead to

the appearance of significant laminar sectims of boundary layer on the ship mdels.
The viscous drag of the models decreases oomared to the turbulent flow conditions
in the bomdary layer. which is a cause for undesirable errors when recalculating
to actual Reynolds numbers. Therefore special ensures to turbulise the boundary
layer of the models are taken in all of the model testing basins MOI-[62].

It is possible to accelerate the transition of the laminar boundary layer to the
turbulent state by various methods:

a) By increasing the local surface roughness in the forward part of the mdel
(pins of different shape, trip wires, strips with large grainy roughness);

b) By increasing the turbulence of the oncoling flow using gratings caved in
front of the model;

c) By varying the physical properties of the fluid in order to increue the
Reynolds nusber (for example, heating the water in the basin).

§V.4. Flow Structure and Frictional Drag in the Transition Region of a Boundary
Layer

A study is nade below of sons of the quantitative relations pertaining to the
calculation of boundary layer characteristics in a transition region. In connec-
tion with the fact that such relations have been insufficiently studied. it is
possible to establish such relations at the present tine only for a plate [25].

The experinental observations show that in acne stage the developent of Tollnien-
Schlichting waves leads to the fornstion of a concentrated vortex which than is
formed into vortex loops in the boundary layer. Rupture of the vortex loops leak
to the occurrence of turbulent spots which. moving along the flow, develop along
and across the laminar boundary layer. The spots are generated randonly. and as
they grow they overlap each other. leading to the. function of a nonletely turbu-
lent bomdary layer.

The passage of the spots over different sections of the body surface leads to
alternation of laminar and turbulent flows. This alternation is described quanti-
tatively by the "intermittence factor":

A comparison of formula (V. 26) with the experimental data is presented in

Figure v.12. The presented graph confirm universality of the relation obtained.
This means that the "internittence factor" is defined only by the value of 1.
However, this says nothing about the location of the transition region on the
surface over which flow takes place. It is recouended that the value of the
critical Reynolds number at the transition point be calculated by the fornulas
investigated in the preceding sections of this chapter. Analyzing the experi-
mental data (Figure v.13), Narasiaha and mawan [25] established the following
relation between the transition Reynolds nunber Rex-lu/v and the critical Reynolds
number at the transition point Ret:

Re; = 0.5Re‘:~'. (v. 27)
Analysis of the experimental data and obvious theoretical arguannts damnstrated

that the instantaneous value of the velocity in the transition region of the
boundary layer is defined from the equation

where “L is the velocity profile in _a laminar boundary layer;

CHAPTER VI. CONTROLLED TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER

§VI.1. Sone Results of Experimental Studies of a Turbulent Boundary Layer of a
Plate on Injecting or Removing Fluid at the Wall

All of the calculation techniques for determining the characteristics of a turbu-
lent boundary layer (TEL) both in the case of an inperleable surface and a
permeable surface, are based on the application of a defined nutter of experinental
relations relating certain parameters of the boundary layer.

In this section a study is nsde of sons of the experimental results of investigating
the T81. of a plate with distributed removal or injection of a fluid on the surface
over which flow takes place. The fluid entering the boundary layer has physical
properties that coincide oomletely with the fluid properties of the main flow.

The experinental materials presented below are tied hereafter to construct md
check out aeni-enpirical nethods of calculating a controlled TIL.

One of the first and most significant experimtal studies in the indicated area
is the paper by Mickley, Ross. Sguyera and Stewart [1].

The experimental setup used in these studies was a wind tunnel are then 6 uters
long. The permeable surface made of 15 isolated sections with a total area of
3.068x0.3068 m and chewera required to incurs uniformity of auction or injection
was the upper wall of a rectangular channel of a closed operating section. The
lower wall was made flexible; its displacements (using special adjmtnsnt attach-
ments) made it possible spproxinately to insure constancy of the pressures along
the channel. In order to isolate the boundary layer developed on the per-able
surface from the boundary layer of other sections of the wind tunnel. suction was
used before the beginning and on the side walls of the working section.

The capabilities of the setup permitted various suction or injection laws to be
realized within defined limits and also studies to be made of both laniner and
turbulent boundary layers inasnuch as artificial turbulization is not used. During
the experimnts, the velocity and tenperature profiles and also the flow rates of
the injected or sucked air were ”cured.

The data obtained permit determination with sufficient oompletenessof the effect

of injecting or auction on the T31. characteristics. In Figure V1.1, in particular,
velocity profiles in the TB]. cross section located at a distnce of 1190 :- fron
the beginning of the perneable surface are presented for injection and auction of

different intensity. Cosparing these profiles, it is possible to note the
increase in thickness of the boundary layer on injecting the fluid and the decrease
in fullness of the velocity profiles with an increase in vain.

From the point of view of the possibility of lowering drag, the results of cal-
culating the local friction coefficients (Figure V1.2) are of the greatest interest.
It must he noted that in the liickley experiments direct measuremta of the
turbulent tangential stresses were not taken. Their values were determined at the
wall by using the pulse equation and approxisate differentiation of the experi-
mentally obtained relations for 6**(x) considering the presence of injection or
suction and possible deviations from the conditions of constancy of the pressures
along the working section. In Figure V1.2, the results of calculating the rela-
tive local friction coefficient cflcf as a function of the injection or suction
parameter are presented in universali ed form, that is. a form suitable for differ5
ent Reynolds tuners Rer The universalising factor here is a value which is the
inverse of the local friction coefficient (to in the case of vo-O. The graph in

Figure VI.2 offers the possibility of estimating the variation of {f for given

Stanton tube was used for the measurements, the accuracy of the neasurennts in
the small stress and high injection intensity range is doubtful in view of the
strong influence of the transverse velocity cosponent in the boundary layer on the

Hacker's data in the range of (yo/UN“ ”-0.06 to 0.01. just as it is also
necessary to exercise caution with re rd to the critical value of the injection

From the Soviet experimntal studies of injection of a material into the ‘l'BL. it
is necessary to mention the papers of V. P. Hugalev [4], P. N. Romanenko and

V. N. Kharchenko [5]. An interesting analogy was detected in reference [6]
between the effect of uniformly distributed injection and the effect of a positive
pressure gradient in the outer flow on the boundary layer characteristics of a
plate.

The study of the effect of uniformly distributed auction on the m. characteristics
was performed by Kay [6). who, studying the laminarisation problem. was interested

of the T31. during suction. The velocity distribution in the sublayer turned out to
correspond to the exponential law

The studies by Kay received further development in the paper by button [7]. where

surface. In the first version the surface was formed frost two perforated sheets

In the other version the surface was ends of calendered nylon. which insured more

The noted difference in quality of the skin was also reflected in the results of
seasuring the bomdary layer characteristics presented in Figures V1.5 and V1.6.
As is obvious froe the figures. for every two surface versions there is a suction
velocity for which the pulse loss thickness along the plate renains unchanged and
equal to this value at the beginning of the permeable section. For a nylon skin
this relative velocity VOID-0.0046, and for perforated skin 0.0073. which indi-
cates significant influence of the surface qmlity on the flow rate of the sucked
air required to maintain constancy of the thickness of the TBL.

Dutton's experimnts again confirud the possibility of obtaining an umtotic
turbulent boundary layer with uniformly distributed auction; in addition. during
these experimnts it was discovered that for a defined, sufficiently high auction
intensity, inverse transition from turbulent to laninar flow conditions in the
boundary layer is possible.

Pavre, Dunes and Verolet [8] studied TB]. under uniform suction conditions through
a porous surface using measuring devices malopue to those used in reference [1]-
[7] and with the help of a thermanenonetric device. A characteristic feature of
these experinents was significant thickness of the boundary layer at the

beginning of the porous section as a result of the presence of an inerneable
surface 1 seter long ahead of it with a total plate length of about 2 tasters.

The pert-stole part of the plate mdel was made of netsrial with porosity of 501
and pore sizes from 1 to 10 microns. The following were found for different
boundary layer cross sections ad different suction intensities (Va/U varied from
0 to 0.02): velocity profiles, profiles of the men more values of the pulse-
tion velocity_¢l:£ponents turbulent stress profiles on v', correlation
coefficients u '1'le and the longitudinal pulsation energy spectra. Velocity
profiles are presented in Figure V1.7 for the cross section x-300 I from the

beginning of the porous section. The influence of suction is already noticeable
for mini-u- intensity (Valli-0.0007); for large values of vo/U, the velocity pro-
files reveal an inflection point.

 

Figure V1.5. Re**(Rex) for uniforn suction [7]. Surface made
of calendered nylon.

Favre notes that the wall part of the velocity profile is approximated satisfac-
torily by expression (V1.1), which is valid for the mtotic state of a laminar
boundary layer with uniform suction if the value of 01 at the velocity profile
inflection point is taken as the velocity outside the boundary layer U. The
nature of variation of the values of 3(1). 6**(x) (Figure V1.8) calculated by the
velocity profiles is in general close to the Kay and button data. However, the
asynptotic state of the 1'31. was not reached in Pavre‘s experiments. Even with
powerful suction the velocity profiles were still a weak function of distance.
which can be explained by the previously noted characteristic of the experiments
which consists in the fact that suction begins not with the leading edge, but
significantly back along the length of the iner-eeble section in which sufficiently
developed TM. is formed.

The profiles of the values of 1:77 and W presented in Figures V1.9 and V1.10
reveal the significant influence of suction on the longitudinal and transverse
comonents of the pulsation ooaponent of the velocity.

The suction effect on the magnitudes and nature of distribution of the turbulent
stresses (Figure V1.11) is manifested quite characteristically. In spite of the
fact that the tangential stress on the well increases with auction. the turbulent
stresses decrease with an increme in suction intensity. ‘ihe lad-u: distribution
shifts from the wall into the inner region of the TEL. Near the wall in the ed:-
layer zone the tangential stresses of a viscous nature r-u bu/ay significantly
exceed the naatimm turbulent stresses ou'v' in the sucked boundary layer.

sv1.2. Methods of Calculating a Controlled Turbulent Boundary Layer, Which Are
a Development of the Truckenbrodt Method

Approximate methods of calculating the turbulent boundary layer characteristics
can be provisionally divided into two groups: the first group includes methods
based on using the pulse equation. and the second group, methods based on joint
use of the pulse equations (IV.29) and energy equations (“.13). The Truckenbrodt
and Eppler methods. which belong to the second group, are considered in this sew
tion as applied to TB]. control by auction and injection of material. Surveys of
various nthods of calculating 1'31. appear in monographs [lob] (uncontrolled 1'31.)
and [105] (TIL on a permeable surface).

The Bppler method [28] belongs to the group of asthods following the basic princi-
ples of the paper by Truckenbrodt. The initial equations of the method are also
the pulse and energy equations. Additional semi-ewirical relations. as before,
include the functions tf(Re**, a); cD(Re**. a) and Hal). However, the font of
these relations is somewhat altered, beginning with the specific require-ate which,
in Eppler's opinion, they amt satisfy in the case of auction. Bppler considered
the necessity for expanding the region of application of the above-nentioned func-
tions in the direction of values of H<1.2, in view of the fact that suction leads
to a decrease in the napitude of this form parneter. The aentioned requireunta
basically consist in the following:

a) Mandatory observation of the condition 111: ll-l for 3+2;

5) Restriction of the influence of fast growth of 6“ for [Pl on (f and c”. which
in the absence of such a restriction, approach zero.

Considering the enmerated requirements. Bppler recouenda the folloving expressions

calculating 'i'BL, the tediousneas of this calculation does not differ very much from
the tediousness of calculations by other methods. The advantages of the
numerical method of integration consist in absence of mathematical simplifications
and additional assunptions, without which it is inmossible to obtain a solution by
other methods. and also convenience of implementation of this mthod on computers.
The accuracy of calculating the TEL characteristics by Eppler's method can be

as a result of a decreme in step size Ax and not by using more couple): numerical
integration procedures.

If during the calculation the lefthand side of this equality exceeds the sdmiuible

Developing his own-method. Eppler had in mind its application for_‘l'Bl. calculation
with suction, in particular for calculating the suction velocity v0 providing for
satisfaction of special requirements imposed on the variation law of some of the

hmmdary layer characteristics. A number of practical purposes of the application

or vuction are satisfied by the condition of constancy of the TBL form parameter
on the surface over which flow takes place. For exawle, maintenance of the pre-
soparation value of the form paramter promotes elimination of the danger of

separation in the case of large positive pressure gradients.

In Figure V1.15 results are also presented from the calculationfor the case of
distributed suction with constant relative velocity vow-0.0005, beginning with
x-0.S. These data show that auction even with low intensity effectively promtes
the prevention of separation with significant positive pressure gradients.

Each of the mthoda investigated in this section has its advantages and disadvan-
tages. For exauple, direct generalisation of the Truckenbrodt method, permitting
us to obtain a relatively precise solution, is distinguished by complexity. The
Eppler method which is free of mthesatical siwlifications as a result of the
application of numerical integration of the initial system of differential equations
is more effective. This fact advantagsoI-ly distinguishes the Bppler mthod among
others from the point of view of performing the calculation on counters. When
using ordinary conputing means the calculation by the Bppler method with the sun
nusber of calculation points differs little with respect to labor intensivenese
from other nethods... at the sen tine giving more reliable results.

§VI.3. Application of the K. K. Fedyeyevskiy Method to Calculation of a
Turbulent Boundary Layer in the Presence of Injection and Suction

In this section a discussion is presented of the nethods of calculating the turbo-
lent boundary layer characteristics in the presence of injection and suction ming
the semi-empirical turbulence theory.

The method of calculating a turbulent bomdary layer in the presence of a longi-
tudinal pressure gradient proposed by K. K. Pedyayevskiy and A. S. Ginevskiy [32].
[33], [36] was taken as the initial nethod.

As will be demonstrated below, the advantage of this method is that with a fixed
value of the K. K. Pedyayevskiy form parameter the basic relations relating the
values which enter into the integral relations of the investigated problem for a
controlled layer with respect to torn coincide with the corresponding uncontrolled
layer functions.

It is reconmnded that the turbulent bomdary layer be calculated in the presence
of injection and auction by the method of successive approximations. beginning with
the assumption of the possibility of extension of the empirical constants and a
number of relations for the characteristics of the uncontrolled bomdary layer to
the case of a controlled layer. ‘l'ne paramters of the mcontrolled turbulent
boundary layer were taken as the zero approximation.

In order to siaplify the method of calculating the zero approximation and avoid
tedious calculations it is possible to use A. V. Kolesnikov's reconendations [35],
which permit inprovement of the calculation part of the K. K. Fedyayevskiy method.

As A. V. Kolesnikov has demonstrated, calculation of the uncontrolled bomdary
layer on the basis of the semi-ewirical turbulence theory by the K. K. Pedyayevakiy
method can be made as siwle as the seni-eapirical calculation tednnique of

L. G. Loytsyanskiy [36] based on the analogy between turbulent and laninar- layers.

As a result of introducing a new form parameter analogous to the L. G. Loytsyanskiy
fora paramter, it was possible to convert the integral relation of the boundary
layer pulses to a linear nonun: form first-order differential equation. the solution
of which is expressed in quadratures. Thus, it we possible greatly to siaplify

the K. K. Fedyayevskiy and A. S. Ginevskiy Inthod for calculation of an uncontrolled
turbulent boundary layer. A comparison of the calculation results by this nthod
with experinents demonstrated satisfactory correspondence. Hereafter the
Fedyayevskiy-cinevskiy-Kolesnlkov method is used as zero approximation for calculat-
ing a controlled turbulent bomdary layer.

911.4. Effect of a High-Speed Jet Aimed Tangentially to a Surface Over Which Flow
Takes Place on the TB]. aiaracteristics for Positive Pressure Gradient

The boundary layer is separated as a result of the fact that the fluid particles

in the wall layer do not have sufficient artery to overcome the positive pressure
gradient in the diverging region of the flow. If the missing energy is fed from
the outside. separation can be eliminated. One of the nethods of cmication of
additional nomentun to the stagnated particles in the flow direction isinjection of
a thin jet having significant energy and directed along the tangent to the surface
over which flow takes place into the preseparation zone. This method has found
practical application as a neans of increasing the lift factor of wing sections
with large angles of attack. The possibility of applying the inveuigated control
nethod in order to decrease the drag (in particular, the pressure drag) is m-
questioned. but this problem has been studied little.

The first indications that "ventilation" of the boundary layer (as this method of
control is sonstimes called) can lead to elimination of separation and alteration

of the aerodynamic characteristics of the profiles, were presented in 1921 by

K. Bamann. and the first exocrinental results were obtained by P. Seawald in 1927.
During World War II broad studies of "ventilation" were performed on wings by

H. Schwier. After World War II, numerous experiments studying the effect of high-
speed jets propagated along surfaces over which flow took place on the boundary
layer and the profile characteristics were psrforned in England (J. William,“ sl.).
in France (P. Carrierg A. Poisson-Quinton. E. Bichelbrenner), in the United States
(J. Attinello. J. Dode, H. 3. Kelly). in the Soviet Union (Ya. G. V1 lenskiy,

v. H. Stepanov. s. T. Kashafundinov), and in the Federal Rspxblic of carnany
(P. Thomas).

A representation of the possibilities and sons of the peculiarities of the
investigated nethod of controlling a turbulent boundary layer can be put together,
in particular, by the results of the paper by P. Thomas [39] in which a study was
made of the effect of "ventilation" of the boundary layer of the flaps on the
characteristics of the section. The object of investigation in this paper was

a wing section NAM-0010 with flap mounting to 25.71 of the wing chord with
respect to length. The angle of setting the flap “k um varied from 0- to 105'
during tests in a wind tunnel. In the case of absence of "ventilation," separa-
tion of the boundary layer began at the point of "bending" of the section tamed
by setting the flap even for cowsrstively small angles. In order to protract the
elimination of the separation, ejection of a thin, high-speed jet fron a slot
through the leading edge of the flap (Figure V1.25) was used.

Fitting of the jet to the surface of the forward part of the flap wa inam‘ad as

a result of the Coande effect.1 Further development of the flow in the boundary
layer of a flap depended significantly on the aptitude of the jet momentum An
increase in the mntun was acmenied by a shift of the separation point in the
direction of the trailing edge and an increase in lift of the section. The latter
occurred as a result of partial or complete mintensnce of the rarefaction peak
at the "break" point under "ventilation" conditions. As Figure V1.26 shows. in
the beence of escape of the jet, this peak becomes diffue.

As a dimensionless characteristic of the jet momentum in reference [39] and also
in other studies devoted to boundary layer control by "ventilation" the "jet
momentum factor" -- cu -— is med:

1By the Cosnde effect we mean the capacity of jets (in particular. plane jets)
propagated near solid surfaces to fit to these surfaces. The capacity to fit to
a known limit is not influenced by the orientation of the jet or the location of
its initial section with respect to the surface [100].

Until the separation point reaches the trailing edge, the lift factor increases
rapidly with an increase in cu and becomes close to the theoretical value

calculated using the Cheplygin-Zhuhovekiy hypothesis.

With an increase in nonentue of the jet above that required for displace-ant of
the separation point to the trailing edge (the corresponding value of the
coefficient c is denoted c A) the growth rate of the lift is sharply decelerated
(Figure IV.27¥. Therefore gnawing cm is of interest for engineers designing a

The approximate theoretical-ewerimental methods of determining cm can be found
in references [39]~[k2]. The discussed method of insuring given displacemt of
the separation point downstream in the boundary layer can be used not only in
studies aimed at increasing the lift of the sections. but also when studying the
problem of decreasing drag of poorly streamlined bodies. It is known that any
reduction in dimensions of the separation zone leads to a decrease in width of the
wake and together with this. a reduction in pressure drag and also total drag. How-
ever. up to now the problen of boundary layer control by high-speed jets remains
almst entirely uninvestigated for this purpose. In addition to lowering the drag
it is also possible to use "ventilation" to increase the efficiency of turbomotora
and marine devices having diverging exit cones in their makeup and, in addition,
to decrease the vibration of various types of struts around which flow takes place
if this vibration is caused by separation of the vortices.

W15. Use of high-Molecular Additives to Decrease Surface Friction in a Turbulent
Flow

The interest of hydrodynamic specialists studying the problem of the resistance
of water to motion of bodies, to anomalous or nonnewtonian fluids is caused by
recent experimnts with flow in pipes of weak water solutions of hidl-moleoular
compOunds. Usually the flow of such fluids is a subject of investigation in
rheology. The experiments perforud by a meter of researchers both abroad [46]-
[49] and in the Soviet Union [501-152] demnstrated that addition of a small

”6

FOR OFFIGAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL IISE ONLY

amount of a defined type of polyner to water leads to a significant reduction in
the surface friction (in individual cases. to 60-702).

It is irpossible to explain the noted effect from the point of view of qmntita-
tive variation of the density and viscosity of the ndium inasnuch as the density
of a weak solution of the polymer in water almost does not differ from the density
of the solvent. and its viscosity measured by ordinary methods, for exswle, by a
capillary viscosineter. as a rule, somewhat exceeds the viscosity of pure water.
It is obvious that the introduction of polymer additives into water lenh it new
qualities. converting it to an snonalom fluid.

Theoretical explanation of the indicated phenomenon has still not been forthcoming
at the present time; therefore a brief study is made below of some of the basic
experimental results. The greater part of the experiments performed with weak
aqueous solutions of polymers in pipes are devoted to establishing the relations
between the pressure gradient in the measuring section of the pipe and the flow
velocity of the fluid or its flow rate. The results of the experimnts of Savins
[68] with aqueous solutions of cellulose and vinyl derivatives are presented in
the graphs in Figures v1.29 and V1.30; the results of Hetzner and Grdtan [69] with
a J-lOO polymer solution are presented in Figure V1.31.

Investigation of the curves presented in Figures V1.29-V1.3l permits a umber of
peculiarities to be noted that are characteristic of flows of weak polyner solutions.
First of all, the addition of not all polyurs will lead to a decrease in pressure
gradient with invariant flow rate. In Figure V1.29 the function Ap-f(Q) wu
constructed from experiments with a 0.2861 solution of cellulose derivatives; in
Figure V1.30, the same relation reflects the behavior of a 0.1631 solution of

vinyl derivative. From the graphs it is obvious that the addition of vinyl deriva-
tive to water only causes an increase in drag, whereas in the case of cellulose it
is clearly possible to note a reduction in drag. Attention is attracted by the
difference in the transition from laminar flow to turbulent in the two solutions:
whereas for the vinyl solution it is possible definitely to indicate the critical
velocity for which the laminar motion shifts to turbulent. in the case of cellulose
solution there is a less sharply expressed broad transition region which is pro-
tracted with respect to the velocities.

Another characteristic feature of flows of weak aqueous solutions of polymers and
pipes is the existence of a velocity zone favord>le in the sense of drag reduction.
As is obvious from Figure V1.29, the curve for the pressure gradient as a function
of the water flow rate with the addition of polymer first goes below the analogous
curve for pure water (region of mfavorable velocities), and then for some value
of the velocity intersects it (region of favorable velocities). Further increase
in velocity leads to the fact that the points lie on a straight line corresponding
to water flow in a large-diameter pipe, that is. with snaller hydraulic losses.
This fact indicates that the drag reduction reached in the expert-rents, increasing
with an increase in flow rate or flow velocity. is not unlimited, but approaches
some value which depends on the type of polyurand flow conditions. Figure V1.32
shows the results of the Savins'experiments in the form of the relation for the
ratio of the pressure gradient with a solution flow to the pressure gradient with
a water flow with the same volumetric flow rate. These curves are an illustration
of the staterent above.

A third characteristic feature of the ration of dilute aqueous solutions of hid:-
nolecular cowounds is the influence of the pipe diameter on the drag reduction.

The greatest pressure yadient reduction with invariant flow velocity is reached,
as is obvious fror. Figure V1.31, in a pipe of suller diameter.

Finally, the inclination of sons. as a rule, the nest effective solutions, toward
aging, toward loss of properties insuring drag reduction. is a characteristic
feature of flows of dilute polymer solutions inortsnt in practical respects.
Thus, Savins [68] points out that deterioration and depolymerisation of the solu-
tion of vinyl I derivative was so intense and fast that during the experiment with

invariant volumetric flow rate constant buildq; of the nasured pressure gradient
was noted with tine in the pipe.

Is has already been pointed out, the greater part of the experiments in flow of
dilute polymer solutions in water in pipes have been connected with determining
characteristics of practical importance - drag and flow rate. The form of the
average velocity profile and turbulent motion characteristics have been studied
such more weakly. The Bogu measurements in pipes with an aqueous solution of
carboxylnethyl cellulose and also the Shaver and Ibrril experimnts [67] demon-
strated that in the solution the velocity profile is less full than in water. Some
intonation about the nature of turbulent mixing was obtained by G. I. Barenblatt,
et a1. [50]. In his experiments a at reamof colored liquid was introduced into a
pure water flow in a transparent tube; on addition of one amomt of carbonyl-ethyl
cellulose solution to the water, the nature of diffusion of the colored stream was
altered, the mixing of the stream became smother, there were no high-frequency
pulsations noted on dissipation of the colored stream in the water.

A natural continuation of the experiments with aqueous solutions of polymers in
pipes was experiments measuring the drag of bodies towed in weak aqueous solutions
of high-molecular compounds and also the study of the influence on the drag which
comes from introducing polymer solutions into the boundary layer of bodies around
which water is flowing.

Among the papers of the first of the above-indicated areas it is necessary to note
the studies by lioyt and Fabula [53], Emerson [54], Levy and Davis [55]. Hoyt and
Pabula established that under certain conditions the turbulent friction coefficient
in weak aqueous solutions of polymers with defined molecular chain length is 702
less than in water.

During tow testing of models in the basin at the University of Newcastle, Bmerson
[51.] obtained data on turbulent friction in aqueom solutions of "SR-”l polyox.
The rated concentrations by weight of the solutions were 0.000125, 0.00025,

0.0005, 0.002 and 0.0052. The effective polymer concentration during the tests
turned out to be noticeably lower than the rated value as a result of precipita-
tion of the polymer out of solution on the bottom of the basin and also as a result
of depolyinrization of its molecules with tin.

Drag determination experiments were performed with 3-116, 6-119 nodels and also

with a plate and pontoon. The KS-ll6 model 2.“ mters long corresponded to a

with an increase in Reynolds nuwer (comtructed by the kinematic viscosity of
water), an increase in drag reduction is noted. Figure V1.36 shows the average
velocity profiles in the cross section of the boundary layer of a plate slammed
by Pitot tubes: the velocity profile in the polymer solution is less full. which
agrees with the above-mentioned msuremnts in pipes. Levy and Davis towed a
plate in a circular channel with an aqueous solution of "SR-$1 polyox. for a
polyox concentration by weiytt of 1.5-10'5, the drag of the plate was reduced by
321, and with a concentration of 15 to 20-10'6. by 631 as compared to the tow
testing in pure water. The Reynolds nmber range constructed by the length of the
plate and speed of towing was 3'106 to 1'107 in the Levy and Davis experiments.

Emerson proposes that the property of polymer solutions having in practice the same
density and viscosity as water to significantly (by 50-60:) decrease the turbulent
friction coefficient be used to obtain full-scale values not only of the wave

drag factor, but also the frictional drag coefficient when using polymer solutions
of the corresponding concentration under model experimentation conditions. The
basis for this procedure is identicalneas of the shape of the curve for the total
drag factor as a function of the Proude amber for models in pure water and polymer
solutions. Figure VI.3S shows the curves of the total drag factors as a function
of the Proude mater for the Its-119 model 2.“ 1: long in water and 0.0052 aqueous
solution of polyner and models of the sane lines 6.1 asters long tested in water
qualitatively confirming the proposition stated above. Quantitative comparison of
the wave drag curves as a function of the Froude number for water and aqueous solu-
tions of polymers can be achieved if the turbulent friction coefficient of an
equivalent flat plate multiplied by son factor which depends on the shape of the
model and takes into accomt the deviation of the frictional resistance of the model

from the flat plate drag (see Figure V1.35) is subtracted from the total drag factor
measured experinentally.

0n the basis of Emerson's tests, he concludes that towing a model 5.5 Intel's long
with UNITE-0.8 and lie-8.10.105 in a polymer solution that decreases the viscous

drag by :02 can give results equivalent to testing a full-scale unit 120 meters long
(Red-lo ).

Just as for certain experiments with flow of polymer solutions in a pipe, Emerson
noted aging of the polyox polymer in his experiments. The big molecular weidit
(lo-106) of polyox obviously is the reason for disbehavior of its aqueom solutions
which are dstroyed under the effect of an acid ndim. liyut. ultrasonic oscilla-
tions and mechanical shear. Hoyt [56) presents noteworthy data- in this sense in a
discmsion of Eaerson's article. Polyox solutions in water were puqed through a
pipe 40 cm long and 1.09 III in dianeter at a speed of about lb Blast: in Hoyt's
experinnts (the Reynolds nutter constructed by the kinematic viscosity of water
is 14,000). Hheress at first the drag reduction in the experiments was 32 and
66.51 by comparison with pure water for polyur concentrations of 310‘6 and
9~10'5, respectively, when pumping the sans solutions through a pipe the third time
pressure gradients less than for pure water by 18.5 and 63.22. respectively,were
obtained. Nevertheless, Emerson and Hoyt point out the possibility of using the
more stable Gusr-Guaa polymer as an additive leading to drag reduction. This
polymer is inferior to polyox only in the sense that somewhat greater quantity of
it is required to obtain the same effect. In hoyt's experiments desgribed above,
aqueous solutions of Gust-Gm with concentrations of 10" and 5'10” revealed
stable drag reduction by 56 and 682 by cowarison with pure water in three experi-
Dents.

The above-described experiments with respect to a flow of dilute aqueous solutions
of polymrs in pipes and also with respect to towing models in such solutions
indicating the possibility of a sharp decrease in surface friction led to state-
nent of a masher of eXperiments with respect to the introductiai of these solutions
into the boundary layer of models around which water is flowing. ‘l'htm, in a dis-
cussion of the above-investigated paper by Emerson, A. Voeper [56] reported pre-
liminary results of testing a mdel which had a polyox solution injected in its

boundary layer. These exteriuents performed at AER (Adliralty Research Center in
ﬂmlar, England) demonstrated that the greatest drag reduction is detected for high
speeds of the oncoling water flow. At low speeds the degree of dispersion of the
solution in the boundary layer obviously is insufficient to obtain the required
polymer concentration in the well region. Above all, the experiunts denonstrated
that even at high velocity the introduction of a solution into the boundary layer
in cross sections located farther than a quarter of the length of the aodel frm
the baw in practice does not change the drag.

The effect of injeCting solutions of high-lolecular compounds on hydrodyna-ic drag
of a cylinder placed across an oncoming flow was examined in reference [50], the
work for which was done at the Mechanics Institute of the USSR Acads-y of Sciences.
A cylindrical pipe 40 s- in disaster and 400 - long had openings 0.5 III in die-tar
used to let the polyner solution into its forward and aft sections. The tests

were run in an open channel at low speeds (on the order of 1.6 Ilsec) so that the
Reynolds nwer constructed by the cylinder disaster was 6.5.10‘. Therefore in
order to obtain transcritical conditions of flow aromd the cylinder surface, it
was covered with a screen SXS - made of longitudinal and annular slots 0.5 II

An aqueous solution of carboxylmethyl cellulose, an aqueous solution of polyvinyl
alcohol and an aluminum naphthenate solution in chemically pure kerosene were used
as the high-molecular additives. The solution concentrations varied from 10 to
0.51.

The experiments demonstrated that injection of water or glycerine solutions in
water of different concentration at low velocities. does not change the cylinder
drag, whereas injecting polymer additives at low escape velocities from the open-
ings leads to drag reduction, the magnitude of which depends both on the type of
polymer and its concentration. A maximal decrease in drag was noted when using
5-101 solutions of polyvinyl alcohol, and it amounted to 31-302: s 0.62 solution
of carboxylmethyl cellulose decreased the hydrodynamic drag by 101.

In conclusion, let us mention the experiments of Thurston and Jones [57] performed
with models of bodies of revolution, on the forward surface of which weather-
soltble. polymer copounds were applied. No models were tested: with a blunt
forward section and a model, the forward section of which had smooth lines. Differ-
ent coverings including "SR-301 polyox were used. The tests concluded with aeasur-
ing the speed of the models under the effect of gravity in a vertical tank 6.1 m
high filled with water. It was discovered that at such low velocities a were
achieved in the experiments (R6106, 1.20.5 meter), drag reduction (by 16-182) is
observed only on a model with blmt forward section on which the boundary lever was
turbulent and high solution rate of the coating was noted. On a mdel with well-
strcamlined forward section obviously under laminar flow conditions, no change in
drag was recorded.

The above-investigated experiamntal data, therefore, demonstrate that introduction
of polymer additives into a bomdery layer leads to a decrease in hydrodynamic drag,
but the effectiveness of these additives is determined not only by the properties
or the polymer, but it also depends on the method by which the polymer additive is
introduced into the flow. There are grounds for expecting that with appropriate
organization of polymer injection in the wall region a significant reduction in
surface friction will be achieved which was obtained in experiments with polymer
solution flows in pipes and when towing models in such solutions.

§VlI.1. Introduction. General Ststelent of the Problsl of a Gas Film on a Body
An effective means of decreasing surface friction is injection of naterials with
low viscosity and density into t‘e wall region. This follows fra a comarison of

the frictional stress on the wall in fluids with different physical constants --
u101 and uzoz.

hence. it follows that significant friction reduction on a wall over which water

is flowing should be expected on gas ventilation of the wall region inasnuch as the
"We of ”191 is a very small proportion of u 92 for then (for air and water. for
example. ulplluzpz-IO'S mder nor-s1 conditions .

with respect to nature of gas distribution in a water flow it is possible to dis-
tinguish two gas saturation conditions: fill in which the clearly expressed,
stable gas-fluid interface is observed, and diffusion or bdable. in which a gas-
water Iixture - a fluid saturated with gas btbbles -- mvss near the wall. The
viscosity and density of such a mixture exceed the viscosity and density of gas,

as s result of which the study of fill gss saturation conditions is of the greatest
interest from the point of view of drag reduction.

A characteristic feature of two-phase flow camed by participation of two i-Iisci-
ble components -- fluid and gas - in the notion canaists in the fact that for gm
velocities given on the body surface (that is, essentially for the given gas flow
rate and method of injecting it in the water flow) and known conditions at infinity,
the form of the joint motion of the phases and. in particular, gas distribution in
the flow are unknown. Accordingly, the phase ration diagram usually is given in
advance, that is, it is designated in advance how (in the form of a solid film or
individual bubbles) the gas is distributed and also how the motion in the fluid and
gas occurs - laminar or turbulent. With this approach determination of the hydro-
dynamic paramters of a flow which is frequently a very cowlicated problem, is
only part of the problem as a whole. A study of the stability of the a priori
proposed form of motion is no less important.

Some exaaples of the indicated method of constructing solutions of the equations of
hydrodynamics are presented in the following sections.

Significant difference in the physical concepts of fluid and gas has given rise to
a dual approach to the investigation of film gas sstm‘ation conditions. 0n the one
hand. in order to study artificially created gas interlayers, the theory of a
developed cavitation flow is used. Actual gas properties are not used in the
calculation. and action with an interface is interpreted as notion of an ideal
fluid with free current lines subject to determination. the pressure at which is
constant and equal to the gas pressure in a film. The characteristic: of developed
cavitating flow depend slightly on the nethod of injection of the gas into the

flow (that is. the method of creating the required pressure in the cavity), and
they are determined by the cavitation and Proude nulbers (see Chapter VIII).

Another approach to the investigation of film gas saturation conditions is

boundary layer theory. The finite magnitude of the density and viscosity of the
gas is taken into account in it, but the influence of its injection on the pressure
distribution which. in accordance with the basic assumption of the theory is con-
sidered known. is neglected. The form of the interface in this case is determined
essentially by the gas flow rate and the method of injecting it into the flow. for
exaaple. in the cue of a porous surface. the distribution of the ventilation
velocity with respect to length.

Discovery of the region of applicability of the indicated theories and determina-
tion of the boundary layer stability conditions in a developed cavitating flow and
in the boundary layer is an important problen in practical respects.

In connection with the first of tne indicated problem it is natural to consider
the statement of the problen of a gas film on a body in general form.

For determinacy let us consider flow over a plane contour, selecting (Figure VII.1)
the system of curvilinear coordinates x, y made up of normals to the contour
(curvesx-const) and curves orthogonal to the nor-als (curves yeast) in such a
way that the elements of length along the coordinate lines will be (ii-hymn and dy
respectively (see Chapter I). and the Lane coefficients hfh-lﬂcy. hz-l. liere

Let us assume that as a result of gas ventilation through the permsble surface
of the contour a boundary layer arises in the all region, the equation for which
in the selected coordinate systen is y-f(x).

Neglecting the effect of viscous forces. the problen of a gas film fornuleted

and obtained from the initial equations (VII.1) for vi-O. In viev of extraordinary
sasllness of the gas density by comparison with the liquid density (pl/92°10'3)v

in the majority of cases it is possible to neglect the force of inertia in the gas
so that the equations of motion for it

will have the integral p-const-pﬁ everywhere in the gas film region. For the
region corresponding to motion 0 a fluid [ysf(x)]. as follows from equalities
(VIIJo), (VII.7), (VII.ll)-(VII.l3), the problem reduces to determining the form
of the interface (the so-called free current line) as a function of pressure in
the fill (more precisely, the cavitation mder (p.-pk)/0202/2)) and the Proude
nuter (for given conditions at infinity). This is the problem of developed cavi-
tating flows.

Its defining conditions contain only a unique pars-star characterizing the state
of the gas - pressure in the cavity pk. Accordingly. the 12th by which the
indicated value of pk is reached. in other words. the gas ventilation method, is
insignificant if we a priori' assume that the flow: conditions are film.

The distinguishing feature of developed cavitating flow is the presence of a
positive pressure gradient directed into the liquid. The pressure at the boundary
of a cavitating film is minimal and increases vith an increase in the y-coordinate.
This fact gives rise to stable nsture of the gas-liquid interface confirmed by
experimental observations. In order to discover the influence of the viscosity

Lamina: motions in the bomdary layer of a plate with interface of two iniscible
fluids were investigated by G. c. Chernyy for ratios between the viscosity and
density of the moving nedia not very small [ll]. The case of a gas filn studied
in reference [1] in which nulerical integration of the systen of differential
equations of the boundary layer (VII.32) was med to calculate the tangential
stress on the wall as a function of the Reynolds nmer. the physical properties of
the gas and its flow rate during injection distributed along the length of the
plate according to the law vo(1)'~1/";- As was denonstrated in [11]. this assign-
ment of the ventilation law, just as in a homogeneous fluid. leads to the self-
sinilar problem. In reference [13] a study was mde of the heat transfer
characteristics in a laminar boundary layer with gas-liquid interface.

svn.2. Iva-phase Laminar Boundary Layer1

Let us present the fundamentals of two-phase laminar boundary layer theory for the
case where gas is injected at the body surface. when developing the theory the
assmtion is made that as a result of gas ventilation on the body surface a solid
film is formed which is a liquid and gas boundary layer interface. For the case
of flow over a plate, this two-phase laainar boundary layer problem was solved in
the paper by Sparrow, Johnson and Bckert [1]. In the mentioned paper it was demon-
strated that the presence of a two-phase boundary layer for a flat plate leads to
sharp drag reduction. Practical realization of this drag reduction depends on the
possibility of creation and maintenance of a oontinuom gas film. Realization of
the continuous gas film is connected with difficulties arising from the necessity
for insuring stability of the interface. for it will decay into separate bubbles
and go over to turbulent flow conditions.

Hocever. the solution to the problem of two-phase laminar boundary layers has
practical significance, for it permits not only establishment of the upper admissi-
ble limit in drag improvement, but it permits an approach to the solution of the
stability problem of gas and liquid interfaces and also the creation of the two-
phase turbulent boundary layer theory.

Statement of the Problem and Basic Equations. when studying flow of a viscous fluid
over the surface of a body. the case where the external flow is considered to depend

on only one parameter is of great interest. The single-parametric solutions to
the Faulkner and Skan problem of a steady-state laminar boundary layer with

Let us use the exponential velocity distribution for solution of the problem of
a laminar two-phase boundary layer [3].

Let us assune that gas is injected into the liquid boundary layer through surface

pores of the body in such a vay that a continuous gas film is created and maintained

§VII.3. Calculation of a No-Phase Laninar Boundary Layer for an Exponential
Velocity Distribution law at the Outer Boundary

The results of nmrical solution obtained in EVILZ of the basic two-phase laninar
bomdary layer equation using the srsu-zn counter [7] are presented. These results
made it possible to investigate the effect of the presence of a gas layer on the
velocity profiles in a two-phase laminar boundary layer and on the frictional drag
of the body along which flow is taking place. In addition, nunrioal calculations
offer the possibility of analyzing the nature of separation of the two-phase lauinar
boundary layer.

Basic Formulas. The equations of Dtion of a laninar boundary layer have the form
(VIIJoZ) and (“1.63). The boundary conditions of the problem are described by the
expressions (VII.6$)-(VII.49).

For numerical calculations on a digital cosputer it is are convenient to introduce
the following values instead of 001) and the variable n by formulas (VII.51) and

equation from [2] analogous to that presented in “11.2

Method of Solving the Equations. Equation (V1133) was solved in advance for a
fluid boundary layer. In this case we have the following boundary conditions:

‘|':l0) - 0; «14(0),. 4.; (“1.106)
"’3 ' f” ‘="°°- (vu.1o7)

The calculation was performed for values of Ao-O to 1.0 with a 0.1 interval and
for values of the parmter 8-1.0 to 0.50.

The boundary conditions (VII.107) do not peruit nt-erical calculations to be per-
formed. Therefore the equation was solved for the following boundary condition:

01;; l fot! :3 -oB. (VII. 107‘)

The value of B must be selected quite large.

[n the given case the basic calculations were performed for a value of 3-12. 'me
control calculations were performed for 3-26, 36 and 6. A ooqarison of the
calculation results for variom B and also with the results of calculations per-

formed for some special cases by other authors [2]. [5] shows that the value of
0'20.) for 3-12 in practice coincides with due exact solution (with accuracy to

four significant figures).

For B<0 the solution of equations (VII.93) under the boundary conditions 0711.106)
and (“1.107) can be aubiguous (see [2]). Therefore after solving the equation,
the equation was solved again under the following boundary conditions:

where [0"z(0)] is the value of the second derivative.

In order to find the solution of equation (1711.93) under boundary conditions
(V11.106) and (VILIO'I). we assume that the solution of this equation is a contin-
uous fmction of 0"2(0). Here we also determine the value of 0"2(0) such that

Equation (Vlt.lll) and the boundary conditions (VILllZ) are obtained by differ-

entiarion of the equation (“1.93) and the boundary conditions uith respect to the
parameter 0"2(0).

Let us note that the practical application of the given nthod when solving non-
linear differential equations with sinilar boundary conditions gives good results
and is easily realized on s cowuter.

The process of successive approdmtions quickly converges even in the case where
the initial value of O“ (0) is selected unsuccessfully. In all of the investigated
cases it turned out to ﬁe sufficient to perforn three to four iterations to satisfy
the boundary conditions with higt precision.

and f"1(€5) and f'1(f.5) will be defined as a result of solving equation (“1.111)

"hen performing practical calculations by the given nthod it is necessary that the
function F be given in a quite broad range of variation of the value of 6'1. and

for a value of 0"1(0) selected in the first approximation. the condition (“1.119)

In the case where the function 17(0'1) is monotonic. the given process of successive

approximations is converging. In order to obtain a solution. 3-6 iterations are
sufficient.

In the case where the function 1(0'1) is not monotonic. in the case of unsuccessful
selection of the first appronination it can turn out that convergence will not occur.

In this case the solution of equation (“1.93) can be obtained as follows. Bquao

Under these boundary conditions the equation can be solved numerically by any
approximate method (for example, the Runge-Xutta method).

The condition 0-0 is satisfied on the outer boundary of the boundary layer (con-
dition VILIO). If we take values of a and b satisfying the relations O"-l'(0')
which is easily expressed in ten; of the introduced variables and function, the
solution to the equation found will correspond to a set of boundary conditions

at the outer boundary of the boundary layer (“1.116).

The inner boundary will be determined from the condition (“1.113) 0'-0-0,
and the value of 00 is not given in advance, but is found as the value of the
independent variable in equation (Vl.ll9a) for 0-0.

This solution technique is effective, but it required analysis of the solution

obtained at points where 0-0, for velocity profiles are possible for which several
points have ﬂ-O'-0.

Results of Ninaericsl Solution of the Equations. For the boundary conditions
(VII.106) and (VII.lO7a) equation (VII.93) was solved for values of Ao-O, 0.1,

0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6. 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95 and for values of the paramter 8-1,
0.5, 0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, -0.45.

For the value of 8-0 and also for certain selected values of 8 and A0, the results
of such calculations appear in [8]. The obtained results agree with these data.

‘lhe results of solving the equation are presented in Figure VIlJo in the form of
the functions u/U-0'(€) for different 8. These graphs characterize the velocity
profiles for a body during flow of a viscous fluid over it under the condition
that at the body wall u-ul. Graphs were constructed for u1/U-0.l to 0.95

In Figure VILS, curves are presented for the function 0" (0)-P[0'2(0)], which
were obtained as a result of solving equation (“1.93) vi boundary conditions

0111.106) and (VII.lO7a). This function is mad when cowiling the boundary con-
dition (“1.114).

Analysis of the data presented in Yigure VII.‘ indicates that with an increase in
the value of O'(0) which is proportional to u(0)-u1, the range of 8 expands where
attached flow is posaihla. The naxiaun value of 8-0.5; then attached flow is
possible only for u(0)-U; ullv-l.

The results of solving equation (VII.93) for a gm boundary layer are presented
in Table VILZ where values are given for 0"1(0), 55. 9"(55) as a function of 60
for different values of B. In this case all the calculations are perfomd for
a value of the parameter R-[ozuzlolulll/Z-ZOO. This value of the parameter
corresponds to the case of injection of air into the boundary layer found by the
water, which is of practical importance.

In Figure VII.6, the relation is presented for the ratio of the frictional drag
in the investigated case of a two-phase laminar boundary layer to the frictional
drag in a homogeneous liquid as a function of the ventilation paramter 00 for
values of 8-1, 0.5, 0, ~0.l. Investigation of this figure shows that injection
of gas leads to significant frictional drag reduction. This reduction is greater
the larger the ventilation parsmter 00 and the value of 8.

Let us consider a two-phase boundary layer consisting of a wall gas layer with

The integral relation of the pulses for the outer boundary layer will be obtained
as follows.

Let us assume that the noml to the interface of the gas layer and liquid layer
makes a small angle of d61/dx. Therefore when ctr-piling the integral relation of
the pulses it is possible to neglect the value on the order of (d61/dx)2, for in
this case the error is within the limits of accuracy of the assuwtiona node when
compiling the bomdary layer equations.

Hereafter. when calculating the liquid layer paraneters, the transverse coordinate
is reckoned from the liquid-gas interface.

Let a consider a two-phase laninar boundary layer for a flat plate on which
vertical injection of the gas into the liquid layer is realized.

Let us assume that between the gas layer and the liquid layer there is an inter-
face vhich is a distance 61 from the plate.

The sliding velocity at the interface and friction reduction as a function of the
air injection in a lasinar film are presented in Figure VII.9.

It is obvious that anall gas flows lead to sharp variation of the frictional drag.
This. a tenfold reduction of friction by the cowarison with the friction in water
(to/too-l/lo) is reached for a value of the paraneter (v0/UWE-3Jr10'2 (which
corresponds to A-10'3). Here the speed of actions: the interface (y-dl) is

0.93 of the speed of the oncoming flow (MID-0.93).

For very small values of the ventilation parameter, the friction reduction is less

signifi cant. Thus, for a value of the ventilation para-seer (vying-1T3,
the friction is reduced by only 251.

SVII.6. Turbulent Motion in a nae-Phase Boundary Layer (Diffusion Gas Saturation
Conditions)

The diffusion or bubble gu saturation conditions are characterized by notion of a
gas-liquid mixture (a liquid carrying gas bubble) in the well region. The parame-
ters of this notion depend on the density and viscosity of the mixture, the method

of injection of the gas into the flow, and the effect of the gravitational forces,
and so on.

In order to trace the influence of the first of the indicated factors, let us con-
sider the case where the dinenaions of the bubbles smpendedin the liquid are so
small comared to the characteristic scale of notion. for exawle, thickness of the
viscous sublayer. that they cannot be used in the calculation in general. Then it
is possible to consider the 3» bubbles as a continuously (and not discretely)
distributed adnixture in the liquid, and the two-phase mixture, as a homogeneous
nediun with values of the density and viscosity that vary from point to point.

If we neglect the effect of gravity and molecular diffusion of theco comonent sus-

pended in the liquid. the equations of notion of such a median can be represented
in the form [11.]

it does for a hoaogeneous liquid: a mixture of two incompressible oomonents

Figure VILlZ. Relative Local surface friction coefficient in a
turbulent two-phase boundary layer on a plate as a function of
gas content at the wall

The perfomed calculations pertain to an idealized system of a homogeneous medit-
with density and viscosity differing from water; they are of interest primerily

for the fact that they indicate the significantly lower efficiency of the btbble
conditions of gas eaturation by comparison with film. In the case of bubble gas
saturation. as follows from the presented data. the effect depends to a great extent
on how successfully the liquid density is reduced directly at the wall. The fact
that a drag reduction of 30-60%, which is of practical interest, is reached at
oo>0.8, indicates the necessity for using the gravitational force in the calculation.
The influence of the characteristic features of the method of injecting the gu,

for example. in the case of porom surfaces. the porosity of the uteriel. the

pore diameter and unifornity of pore distribution with respect to size, appears to
be very inportant.

CHAPTER VIII. FRICTIONAL DRAG REDUCTION OF A SHIP BY CREATIW OF ARTIFICIAL
CAVITIES (GAS FILMS) ON ITS BOTH)“

ﬁVIII.l. Brief Survey of Experimental-Theoretical Research

The results of theoretical and experimental studies presented in the preceding
chapters permit the following possible methods of viscous drag reduction of ships
by boundary layer control to be noted:

1. Suction of the boundary layer in order to protract the transition point of the
laminar bomdary layer to turbulent.

2. Suction of the boundary layer to prevent separation of it and at the same time
provide form drag reduction.

3. Projection of the region of transition of a laminar boundary layer to turbulent
by distributed danping of disturbances (Tollmien-Schlichting instability waves)
as a result of applying elastic coatings.

4. Variation of physical characteristics of a fluid in the boundary layer near
a wall by injection of material with different physical constants into the boundary
layer.

Let us consider the enumerated methods of viscous drag reduction by boundary layer
control from the point of view of the practical possibility of their application on
transport vessels.

The problem of the applicability of boundary layer suction to provide frictional
drag reduction as a result of maintaining laminar flow conditions in the boundary
layer was investigated in detail in Chapters IV and V. M was demonstrated there,
the efficiency of this method of boundary layer control (if we ignore the struc-
tural difficulties connected with its application) depends to a significant degree
on the surface state of the body and the degree of turbulence of the external flow.
Significant flow turbulence in seas and rivers cowlicates the effective use of
this mthod of drag reduction for transport vessels.

Boundary layer auction to prevent separation of the boundary layer and at the same
time provide form drag reduction is one of the first nethods to be substantiated
scientifically. Its application on vessels with h1g1 form drag can turn out to be
expedient. However. practical isplementation of suction is accompanied with sur-
mounting enormous structural difficulties. Therefore it has not found practical
application to this time.

The most effective method of drag reduction for transport vessels is alteration of
the physical constants of the fluid near the wall by injection of a material with
di fferenr. physical constants into the boundary layer. In ﬁlls case it is possible
to use air as the injected saterial. In the ptblished literature the given muted
, of drag reduction has come to be called "air librication."

Air lubrication for frictional drag reduction has been proposed new tins.

Laval atte-pted the first experiment in air lwrication in 1882. Self-propellled
river boats equipped with an air lubrication systen proposed by L. M. Lapshin were
tested in the USSR in 1938 and 1957 [l], [2].

For the tests, the bottom of the vessel was separated into cowartunts by longitud-
inal planks. Air was injected in the forward end of the bottom through tubes cut
into the bottom flush with the surface. In the tests the author was only interested
in the final effect -- reduction of the water resistance to the ship.

In the theoretical studies by K. K. Pedyayevskiy [3], [lo] and 1.. c. Loytsyanskiy [S]
on the problem of frictional drag reduction by altering the fluid density at the
wall, it was asst that as a result of gas injection the fluid density varies
continuously according to a given law from the injected g8 density to the density
of the oncoming fluid. The fluid density variation law was selected from the condi-
tion of obtaining a flow with similar velocity profiles in the boundary layer and
finding the solution in silplest form.

The possibility of practical implementation of air hbrication with such density
distribution was not investigated in these experiments.

Using a power law for the velocity profile in a turbulent boundary layer,
K. K. Fedyayevskiy obtained a simple fornula for the friction coefficient in the

presence of a fluid with different constants near the wall

For a turbulent boundary layer L. c. Loytsyanekiy obtained the following formula:

As the formulas of K. K. Pedyayevskiy and 1.. G. Loytsyanskiy demonstrate, aeration
of a turbulent boundary layer in the water leads to very large drag reduction.

The frictional drag factor calculated in references [3], [S] for a flat plate with
turbulent flow conditions was 1/130 of the value of CEO for a homogeneous fluid.

The experimnts did not confirm the results of these calculations. Usually when
injecting a gas into a liquid boundary layer the drag reduction is no rate than 30-60%.

As I. D. Zheltukhin demonstrated, the cause of divergence of the theoretical and
experimental data is that when solving the stated problem certain characteristic
features of the gas-liquid flows were not taken into account.

The weakest points in the research [3] and [5] are:

a) The assumtion of monotonicity of the transition of the properties of the medium
from the gas properties at the wall to liquid properties at the boundary layer
boundary.

When injecting a gas through a porous surface into the boundary layer usually inter-
faces are formed at which the properties of the Indium can be discontinuom and
not vary monotonically;

b) In the above-indicated research it is ignored that the wall material and,
especially, the wettability factor which is absent in homogeneous flows, have
great influence on the characteristics of fluid motion in the boundary layer.

In the paper by I. D. Zheltukhin. the first effort was made to consider the influence
of the above—indicated peculiarities of gas-liquid flows on the frictional 'drag of
a liquid flowing over a flat plate with gas injected through a porous surface.

The solution of the problem of a gas-saturated boundary layer on a porom surface
is given under the assimption that the conditions of novemnt of the fluid in the
gas film are laminar. A study is made of the processes occurring when injecting
gas into a turbulent bomdary layer. The author demnstrated that in the investi-
gated case the drag reduction is explained not by a decrease in fluid viscosity,
but by the processes occurring near the solid wall.

Thus, in the published theoretical and experinntal research. a study an made of

the flow characteristics in the boundary layer for a defined injection In and
density distribution across the layer.

In connection with the fact that realisation of the ache-e giving continuous
variation of the density of the mixture across the boundary layer is in practice
impossible, K. K. Pedyayevskiy stated the idea of expediency of blowing air through
the slots or holes under the bottom of the vessel so that a gas interlayer will be
found.

In order to discover the possibility of obtaining such an air interlayer

K. K. Pedyayevskiy set to some special experinsnts in 1963 [lo]. In these experi-
ments a study was made of the ratio of the friction coefficient with air librica-
tion to the friction coefficient without it as a function of the flow rate factor.

The problems connected with discovering the physical conditions of the existence

of gas interlays, their form and dinensions were not investigated in the published
papers. Nevertheless, during practical use of gas interlayers for drag reduction
knowledge of the dinensions and physical conditions of formation of these interlaysrs
has decisive significance. Therefore the above-mentioned papers did not offer
specific recoundations with respect to the practical use of gas interJayers for
frictional drag reduction of a ship, but they only demonstrated the theoretical
possibility of their application theoretically and experimentally.

The shape and size of artificial cavities occurring on injection of gas at the
lower side of a flat horizontal plate over which flow istaking place were first
studied theoretically and experientelly by A. A. Butusov [6], [7] under the
direction of A. N. lvanov. For the theoretical solution of the probles the asun-
tion was sade that the pressure at the interface of the gas interlayer and the
liquid remains constant. This condition will be satisfied with great accur‘icy
when the fluid density in the flow hitting the plate is asny times greater than the
density of the material in the gas interlsyer. For the case of gas interlayers

of practical importance for frictional drag reduction of a ship this condition is
always met.

Under the given assunption. the boundary condition at the liquid and gas interface
is equivalent to the boundaryconditiOn assumed in developed cavitation theory [3].
Hence, it follows that the mathenatical methods of developed cavitation theory are
applicable to the solution of the problen of the shape and size of the gas inter-
layer (cavities).

Using the methods of linear cavitation theory [9]. A. A. Butuzov solved the problem
of the shape and size of the cavity occurring behind a wedge-shaped appendage on
the lower side of a flat horizontal plate.

As a result of the theoretical solution, it was established that the len th of
the cavity cannot exceed an amolmt defined by the Fronds nulber (Fly-ml gik )
calculated by the onconing flow velocity "0 and by the cavity length it. The
analogOus problem was solved by V. B. Starobinskiy for the case of a bounded flow
[10]. [11].

For prOper estiastion of the drag reduction achieved by creating thin gas inter-
layers (films, cavities) and development of the nethod of recalculating the results

of andel tests to ful 1-sca1e situations, it is necessary to study the flow of a
viscous liquid over a body with gas interlayers (cavities).

The solution of this complex problen can be reduced approximately to calculation
of two-ohms boundary layers.

A theoretical investigation of two-phase boundary layers is presented in

Chapter VII. The calculation techniques presented in Chapter VII are based on the
assmtion that the injected gas for: a continuom interlayer with expressed
hydrodynamic gas-liquid interface. The gm injection.lw is taken from the con--
dition of obtaining similar velocity profiles in the boundary layer.

The calculation results demonstrated that the presence of a two-phase boundary layer
(air-water) leads to sharp frictional drag reduction of the streamlined bodv.

Practical realizat ion of a two-phase boundary layer and the corresponding fric-

tional drag reduction on a ship depend on the possibility of creating and maintain-
ing a continuous gas interlayer.

In addition to the theoretical solution of the stated problea special experimental
studies [7] were pcrforud which confirmed the theoretical conclusions and demon-
strated the possibility of significant frictional drag reduction of transport
vessels by equipping the vessel with a special "air lubrication" system.

The theoretical and experimental results obtained in the USSR at this tine permit
an efficient approach to calculation of the "air ltbrlcation" system for a transport
vessel. The most prospective is to use "air ltbrication" on inland transport ships.

Among the foreign papers it is necessary to nore the Danish patent of Gram [12]

in which it was proposed that air interlayers supported by means of automated valves
be fomd on the bottom divided by longitudinal and trmsverse partitions into a
large nuaber of sections.

In this chapter some of the results of the theoretical and exparimntal studies of
the problem of frictional drag reduction of ships by creating cavities on the
bottom are discmsed.

0n the basis of the linear theory of developed cavitation, a study is made of the
probles of determining the shape and the dimensions of artificial cavities mder
conditions of mlimi ted and limited depth of flow. ﬂith significant flow restric-
tions with respect to depth. it becous inpossible to use the methods of linear
cavitation theory. Therefore the solution of the indicated problem has been investi-
gated here without linearizing the boundary condition.

Let I; present the solution of the problem of the shape and dimnsions of an

artificial cavity formed behind m appendage under the conditions of an unlimited
fluid obtained by A. A. Butuzov [7].

Let us make the following assuptions in order to siwlify the problem:

a) Let us consider the fluid ideal, idcomressible and having weight. The notion
of the fluid is assumd to be laminar and irrotational:

b) The bottom of the vessel is replaced by a horizontal plate vhich extends
infinitely in the longitudinal direction;

c) The cavity is fomd on the lower side of the plate a a result of gas (air)
injection behind an appendage, the dimensions of which are smll by cosparison with
the length of the cavity;

d) Let m consider the pressure on the botton of the cavity constant. The gas
flow in the aft end of the cavity is not considered. and it Is replaced by an
imaginary flow aromd an appendage of the sale for: as the forming cavity, but
symetrically arranged. -

Thus. in order to close the cavity, the Ryabushinskiy cavitation system is used;

e) Let us asst-e that the cavity (gas interlayer) is thin. This allovs the methods
of linear cavitation theory to be med when solving the problem.

As a result of malyting the numerical calculations, A. A. Butuzov drew the
following theoretical conclusions.

shaped page cannot exceed some value 1" defined by the Froude mater

2. For the value of the Proude nimber Fr t'P’k on a snooth bottom, cavities having
a length of 1-1,]: and different maxim- thickness are theoretically possible.

The results presented here are valid for the case where the length of the appendage:
is small by coeparison with the cavity length.

In order to obtain results that are valid for any relations betveen the appendage
and cavity lengths, A. A. Bututov [6), [26] generalized the Ryabushinskiy achene

to the case where the cavity closes on a fictitiom appendage aimificantly shorter
than the primary appendage or the cavity.

The problea of determining the cavity parameters by a aodified Ryabmhinskiy
system (Figure “11.2) in the case of a thin cavity reduced to solving an integro-

Comparison of Theoretical and Experimental Results. The above-presented theoreti-
cal data on artificial cavities foned on a flat horizontal bottom were checked out
experimntally in a flame with plate equipped with waohera [6]. The plate was

9’05 nu long, 200 III wide and 20 a thick. The rear tip of the appendage was 315 n
from the forward edge of the plate. The cavities were forud by injecting ﬁt on
the bottom surface of the plate behind wedge-ahaped appendages.

During the air injection teats. the following values were neuured: the flow
velocity in front of the plate (by a Prmdtl tube). the pressure in the cavity (a
micronanoneter). the air flow rate (Venturi tube). The geometric parameters of the

cavities were determined visually, and also by photography. The tests were run in
oncoming flow velocity range of 0.5 to 0.7 n/aec.

Appendagea with the following dimensions were tested: 1) al-loo I: 0-0.1;
2) al-SO -, «0.12; 3) a1-25 Ila. $0.12; 4) a1-12 III, $0.167.

(beervationa of the cavity development with an increase in air flow rate confirmed
the main theoretical conclusion regarding the existence of a cavity of liaiting
length.

The experiments demonstrated that for very enall air flow rates the cavities had a
profile reaenhling the theoretical profile of limiting cavities. Incresing the

air flow rate by 20 times led to an increase in the air- taken from the end of the
cavity region by two loops leading to the side plates. but in practice had no

influence on the geometric dimensions of the cavities. Further significant increase
in the air flow rate led to an increase in cavity thickness and loop thickness.

which almost do not change at all with an increase‘in the air flow beginning with
almost zero values of the air flaw, were considered limiting. Data are presented
in the same figure for an stndage a1-12 II (cal-2 In).

From Figure VIII.5 it is obvious that with the exception of thickness. according

to the theoretical and experimental data, all of the remaining basic geometric
parameters of limiting cavities (length and width) correspond to each other. The
difference in the theoretically and experimentally obtained thickness of the cavity
become significant only for cavities which are long by comparison with the appendage
dimensions, and the appendage dimensions themelves are aamll. For a anll

appendage the influence of the surface tension forces is significant. Thu. the

theoretical proposition that the cavity surface is tangent to the appendage surface
is not properly realised.

SVIIIJ. Effect of Limitation of the Play on the Shape and Dimensions of an
Artificial Cavity Formed on the lover Side of a Horizontal Plate

Solution of the Linear ﬁlo-Dimensional Problen. In order to consider the effect
of limitation of the flow on the form and dimensions of an artificial cavity,
according to v. 3. Starobinskiy [10]. [11]. let us consider plane flow of an

ideal. incompressible fluid. but one with weight, in a strip of width I extending
infinitely in both directions (Figure VIIIJ).

The solution to the system of algebraic equations wu found on the 11-20 ogquter.

0.05, 0.025, 0.0125. iﬁ-OJ. 1.0. 1.6. 2. 2.6. 3.6. 5.0. 7.0. The value of the
parameter f was selected in the calculation process.

Analysis of the performed calculations indicates that. jut as in the case of
deep water (see §VIII.2), for each fixed value of the shallow water parameter '1!

there is a value of the parameter f for which the cavity characteristics rmdergo
discontinuous variation.

Here the cavity profile somehow "intersects" the button. that is. for f>fk the
solution to the problem becomes physically Prealistic. This is equivalent to the
fact that the value of the parameter f-gt/Uo cannot exceed ‘1"

Consequently. even under linited flow cmditions for given velocity 00. the cavity
length i also cannot be greater than that which is determined by the value of the
parameter ‘10 that is. even in this case there is a cavity of limited length.

It is easy to demonstrate that a cavity of limited length can have different shapes.

The calculation results permit consideration of the influence of the depth of the
fluid on the cavity shape and dimensions.

The influence of the shallow water parameter can be analyzed by the curves
(a/n)(f) and (6/02)“) for different values of in which are presented in Figures
VIII.8 and VIII.9. Here. 6 denotes the maximal thickness of the cavity. By
these relations it is easy to determine a narrow range of variation of the
parameter f for different values of "H for which discontinuous variation of the
cavity parameters takes place.

Fron an investigation of these figures it follows that with a decrease in fluid
depth. that is. from an increase in the value of the parameter in. the values of fl:
increase. Consequently. with a decrease in fluid depth the length of the limiting
cavity increases.

Analysis of expression (VIII.S3) shows that for a value of Frrl discontinuous
variation of the cavity parameters takes place for any values of iri/ZB. There-
fore the straight line Frn-l is an asysptote to the curve Prn-fﬂ’r it) presented
in Figure VIIIJO.

Thus, for the linear statement of the problem, the conclusion is obtained that for
szl, existence of a cavity of finite length is iwossible.

This conclusion is not confirmed by the experimental data. Lack of correspondence
between the theoretical and experimntal data is explained by inadmissibility of
linearization of the boundary condition for F1191. The analogous conclusion is
obtained in the linear theory of pine surface waves under shallow water conditions.

For Pruzl it is possible to obtain an approximate solution only as a result of
solving the nonlinear problem while keeping ter- of higher order of smallness.

Thus, the theoretical studies of the form and dimensions of artificial cavities
under limited flow conditions permit the following conclusions to be drawn:

1. For each fixed value of the velocity [10 and water depth ll, there is a Proude
number Fr; calculated by the cavity length. which is limiting for the given values
of U0 and II. The cavity length cannot exceed the value defined by the limiting
Froude nutter Prk.

2. with an increase in the Fronds nudaer with respect to fluid depth l-‘rn-Uo/v’a,
the value of the limiting Proude nuter calculated by the cavity length
Frk-Uo/ngk decreases. and the cavity length increases.

3. The linear theory is unsuitable for investigating the shapes and sizes of
artificial cavities when Fr >1.0. In this case the solution of the problem can be
obtained only when mintaingng nonlinear boundary conditions.

Solution of the Nonlinear “yo-Dimensional Problem. Let us present the results of
solving a nonlinear two-dimensional problem of finding the form and the dimensions
of artificial cavities for Froude nuabers with respect to depth Prusl obtained by
V. B. Starobinskiy [11].

When stating the problem let us also make the same assuptions as were made when

we shall not neglect the squares of the induced velocities as was done before.

The investigated problen of determining detached flow over a wedge was reduced to
the problem of finding the function realizing conformal mapping of the flow region

For investigation of the form and dimensions of artificial cavities with Frauds

used the asymptotic method of narrow strips [15], [18]. The concept of

Academician M. A. Lavrent'yev regarding approximater'calculation of the derivative
of the confornal mapping in the case of narrow regions was med as the basis for
this method. It turned out that in the cne where the napping region 1: narrow
and the boundary of the region is sufficiently smooth. the derivative of the con-
foraal rapping at the boundary can be calculated by the following formula:

Casparison of Theoretical and Experinental Results. In experimental study was made
of the shapes mad dimensions of artificial cavities in a bounded flow in a fluIIe
in order to check out the theoretical conclusions. The experimental conditions
corresponded to a hidx degree to the prerequisites set down a the basis for the
theoretical study (horizontal plate, plane flow).

The cavity was created on the lower side of a rectangular channel. the height of
which could be varied. The channel height variation offered the possibility of
investigating the fomtion of cavities with different channel restrictions.

A wedge 2 In high and 12 as: long was used to fora the cavity.

During the experiment the following values were measured: the flow velocity.
pressure in the cavity. air flow rate to form the cavities. shape and dimansions
of the cavities.

The tests were perforated for the following channel depths: $23.5, 15.5, 11.5.
7.5, 3.5 cm.

1he experiments demonstrated that with variation of the cavitation nui>er (an
increase in the air flow rate) for fixed channel depth, the cavity thickness
increases, and when reaching the limiting thickness, the cavity exists without an
appendage, moving ahead against the flow, or it is arranged so that the appendage
is in its midsection.

Cowarison of the tests obtained for different channel depths indicates that the
general nature of the influence of the cavitation ntﬂer is retained for all
constrictions of the flow. With a decrease in channel depth, the relative thick-
ness of the cavity which takes off the appendage decreases significantly.

Analysis of the experimental data demnstrated that the Proude nuber calculated
by the cavity length Prt-Uo/lg—i for given 1/]! remains constant.

A coaparison of the theoretical aid experinental results is presented in

Figure VIII.15 on which the theoretically and experiaentally obtained curves for
the variation of the Proude mater with respect to channel depth Prn-Uo/JE

are plotted as a function of the Proude nuter with respect to liniting cavity
length Frk-Uo/v‘g(2.k+2a).

Prom Figure VIII.lS it is obvious that the theoretical results correctly reflect
the nature of the influence of the limited nature of the flow and the artificial
cavity parameters.

The conclusions obtained as a result of the theoretical study offer the possibility
of analyzing the experinental data. Thus. theory dennnstreted that for a cavity
of limiting length variation of the cavitation mater only leads to variation of
its thickness. "hen perfoming tests in a flute, the form of the cavity was close
to limiting. This made it possible to obtain the universal function Fri-far“)

for the cavities presented in Figure VIII.lS. '

The results of emuring the air flow rated used for cavity formation deannstrated
that with a decrease in channel depth the air flow rate increases sooewhat with
an identical value of old.

SVIIIJo. Results of Experiuntal Studies of the Creation of Artificial Cavities

made of plexiglass.

The model had straight-wall syuetry with respect to the nidstation fora. A third

towing cradle. For uniform air distribution at its emission point along the
width of the model. metal boxes were installed on the model (Figure VIIIJG). The
lower part of the box was in the for: of two horizontal sheets separated in the
transverse direction by a slot which was covered by a wedge-shaped appendage and
could be covered by a plank flmh with the bottom. In order to prevent surfacing
of the air along the sides, vertical heels were installed on the bottom of the
model which were arranged parallel to the foreoand-aft plane of the model at a
distance equal to the slot length from each other. The heels installed on the
model were 2.55 m long, 50 and 25 - hiya. The distance between the forward edge
of the keel and the forward perpendicular of the mdel was 1.7 nters. The
distance between heels was 0.5 meters. the distance from the slot to the forward
perpendicular was 1.85 meters.

During the tests the following neaaureaents were taken: the towing speed, the
towrope drag of the model, the trim of the mdel, gas fill dimensions in plan
and amomt of injected air. pressure in the gu film by gauges and also observa-
tion and photographing of the gas film through the plexiglaas heel using a hydro-
perisoope.

The mdel was also tested with a blind slot, with and without heels.
The experimental observations demonstrated the following:

a) An artificial cavity (gas film) has a clearly outlined rear boundary and
retains its shape and dinension stably. Inside the gas film the pressure is
almost constant. This indicates similarity between gas film and artificial
cavities.

Additional proof of the correctness of this conclusion is the fact that at model
towing speeds of Uo-3 m/sec and hiyler, it was possible to distinguish the
"reentrant jet" known from observations of cavitating flows, the spray from which
fanned out in the direction of the lateral heels.

me air from the gas film was removed in two sheets adjacent to the lateral heels;

b) The forsation of a stable gm film depends to a significant degree on the
presence of an appendage. The slot turned out to be ineffective without the
appendage, for the gas film did not form behind it with small air flat rates;

c) The experiments confirmed the theoretical conclusion of the existence of a
limiting Proude nuaber for a gas film which does not depend on the dimensions of
the appendage or the amomt of injected air. At slow speeds of the model. the
limiting Proude nuaber of the gas film Prk- lv’ng according to the experimental
data was close to the theoretical value of 11-0423, and I’m-0.4075 obtained
experimentally in a flune;

d) The air flow rate in the presence of an appendage ahead of the slot had in
practice little influence on the gas film thickness. In the absence of an
appendage, the air flow rate has a significant influence on the thickness of the
gas f i In. According to the theoretical conclusions, the thickness of the gas film

is proportional to the appendage heiﬂat;

e) The presence of a gas film leads to plming-up of the aodel and increased trim
by the stern:

f) The greatest drag reduction for the model with respect to the bare hull drag
was from 10 to 20%, depending on the draft of the model.

Results of Experiments with River Boat Models. The test subjects were models of
the "Bol'ahaya Volga" class vessel ad the duly “lb barge. The primry purpose
of the tests was to investigate the drag of a vessel in the presence of gas film
on the bottom.

Analysis of the test results led to the following conclusions.

1. At high flow rates, the gas is removed from the gas films in the form of two
sheets adjacent to the parts of the model bottom close to the sides. The sheet

width essentially depends on the towing speed. Near the calculated speed the
sheets are cowaratively narrow. With a decrease in speed. the air sheets grad-
ually expand. they approach the center line of the bottom, and the air escapes
from the gas film in the form of formless "chunks" primarily jtmt as in the case
of the schematized model.

2. The air flow rate in practice has little influence on the gas film dimensions.

3. Experiments confirmed the previous conclusion of the existence of a limiting
Proude nudaer with respect to the length of the gm film Fri. This is obvious from
Figure Vili.l7 in which the relation is presented for the Proude nuﬁer Pr as a
fmction of velocity for different values of the air flow rate, for two els

of different scales (1:10 and 1:20).

4. In all cases sir injection leads to a decreue in the towrope drag. The
relative drag reduction of a model of the "Bol'shaya Volga" ship (by cowerison
with bare hull drag) for model speeds corresponding to actual speeds, is 9 and 8.51

for a flow rate of 0-8.5 l/sec. Drag reduction of the Iodel reduced to the
drag of a nodal with side keels and blind slots is 13!.

It mt be noted that the version of fornation of gu film on the botton of a
model of the "Bol'shaya Volga" was not optisal. As further experinental studies
have demnetrated, by developing hydrodynanically optinal dinnsions of the
appendages for-ins the gas film and finding the most efficient nethod of air
injection under the bottom of the ship. the gain in drag of the model can be
increased significantly at the calculated speed.

culated speed. increasing the air flow rate leads to an increased gain with respect
to drag. which is explained by the presence of air sheets behind the gas film,

SVIII.5. Estimation of Drag Reduction of a Ship Equipped with a Device for
Creating Artificial Cavities (Gas Film) on its Botto- by Model Test Data

Let us discuss an approximate lethod of calculating the drag reduction of a ship
with a system of gas film arranged on its bottom. This method is based on the
assumtion that the effectiveness of the device providing for frictional drag
reduction of a ship will be unchanged for a mdsl and a full-scale ship with
identical Proude nulbers [27].

By the efficiency of the device creating the gas file system on the bottom of a
nodel. we nean the ratio

k AR.
" W‘ (VIII.77)

Here AR” is the experimentally obtained gain with respect to drag;

A is the ideal gain with respect to frictional drag which can be obtained by
ca culating if we assuse that the appendage drag is equal to zero and that the
air cow rs the entire flat part of the bottos.

The valm of no is constant for given velocity, and it is found as the difference
between the frictional drag of a plate with a length equal to the distance between
the forward and aft perpendiculars of the node1:snd bean equal to the distance

between the side keels and total drag of two plates separated by a solid gas file.

The results of calculating the efficiency k-ARIIABO for the 1061 B barge model are
presented in Figure VIII.22. It is obvious that the highest efficiency of the
device corresponds to speeds close to the calculated speed for which the gas filu
cover the greatest part of the bottom. It is obvious that the efficiency It, which
contains the experimental value of A3. in the nunerator takes into accomt the
influence of the appendage drag on the efficiency of the device and also the
influence of escape of air from the gas film.

The results of calculating the expected absolute gain with respect to drag

AR with respect to the bare hull towrope drag of the 661 B barge are presented in
Figure VIII.23. It is obvious that the expected drag reduction with respect to
the towrope drag of the barge (curve 1) is 22-32% -- in the barge speed range of
3.5-5.0 u/sec (12.5-18 kin/hr).

A full-scale test of the effectiveness of the drag reduction of a barge equipped
with a device creating a systes of air cavities on its bottos was performed in
the Kuybyshev Reservoir on the Volga in nay-June 1965 [27].

Figure “H.210 shows the results of full-scale testing of the 661 B barge in the
for: of the towrope drag curves for the barge. The middle curve corresponds to
the bare hull tovrope drag in the presence of a pmher boat, the lower curve wu
obtained when pushing the barge with sinultsneous injection of air on its bottom.
The upper curve corresponds to the towrope drag with appendages with which the
barge is equpped to create an air lubrication system.

From a comparison of the curves presented in Figure “H.210 it is obvious that the
application of air ltbrication on the bottom of the 461 B barge led to total drag
reduction of the barge on the order of 23-252 of the bare hull drag in the speed
range of 11-18 Ius/hr.

Hence, it is possible to draw the conclusion that the full-scale tests demon-

SVIII.6. Results of Investigating Artificial Cavities Created on the Botton of
Planing Vessels

In the preceding sections a study was made of the problem pertaining to the case
of creating artificial air cavities on the flat botton of slow superships having
large parallel niddlebody. The application of air lubrication for these vessels.
in which the frictional drag is a sipificant part of the total drag, turns out to
be most efficient. Another class of ship in which it is possible to expect drag
reduction of the water as a result of artificial cavities is planing vessels.
Planing vessels have frictional drag of about 601 of the total drag. The experi-
ments performed by a collective of authors directed by I. 1'. Yegorov [23], [26]
demnstrated that it is possible to achieve effective frictional drag reduction on
shallow-draft planing vessels by injecting air behind the step, that is, by creating
an artificial cavity on the bottom.

For planing vessels the conditions of creating air cavities differ significantly
froa the conditions for slow superships.

In the investigated case of a big-speed vessel the cavity parameters are signifi-
cantly influenced by the conditions of motion, closeness of the free surface of the
water, variable trim of the vessel, botton shape as a whole and center of gravity
position.

Results of a Theoretical Study of Artificial Cavities Created on a Planing Surface.
In order to discover the laws of foraation of an artificial air cavity on a planing
surface A. A. Butuzov solved the two-dinensional linearised problen of cavitating
flow in the case of cavity formation on a body planing over the free surface of a
fluid with Height [20]. This problem is solved lander assmtions with respect to
the fluid and the nature of its notion nsde for the solution of analogous problens
presented in §VIII.2.

The planing surface (Figure VIII.25) CDEB'IU' consists of three rectilinear soy-ants
CD, DE, "J and the section 58'}! of arbitrary shape located inside the cavity. The
free surfaces ahead of and behind the planing body can be considered as surfaces

of cavities of great extent, the pressure on vhich is given (0-0). Accordingly,
they can be taken as bounded, semi-infinite, horizontal plates A'A and 3'. These

surfaces have been introduced in order not to investigate free surfaces of infinite
length, the introduction of which leads to great difficulties for numrical calcula-
tions.

Prom the curve Cx/CZ-ﬂh/cl.) characterizing the variation of the drag R for
constant vertical lXad (want) as a function of h/uL, it follows that in the
limiting case of snooth closure of the cavity (blob-0.2673: 6-0), the planing
surface has nininun pressure drag. This drag is 2.36 tines less than the drag
experienced by an ordinary stepped craft. The condition «1-0 is the mat favorable,
for under this condition, expenditures of power on injecting gas into the cavity
are theoretically not required, and these conditions can be insured (as follows
iron the graph of [0-6 (h/al.)) for p-const as a result of a decrease in the
ordinary step heigh (0-0) and a shift of the load toward the bow.

According to Figure VIII.26, for transition from the cue of 0-0 to the case of
two with p-const. the step height wt be decreased by 802. and the load center of
gravity shifted 15! toward the bow.

As the calculations demstrated. these conclusions are qualitatively valid for
Froude nuwers no less than one. Hith an increase in the velocity (P131), a
cavity that closes smothly to the botton for-ed on a planing surface of given
shape and dimensions with fixed load (p-const, islhu/L-const). become elongated.
The angle of attack of a planing surface decreases in this case. and the vetted
length ahead of the cavity increases solsewhat.

‘lhe calculations demonstrated that an ordinary appendage (h-v-O) installed on a
flat bottom (h-p-O) favorable for slow vessels is not favorable for high-speed
draft for which the favorable bottoa shape fro. the point of view of drag reduc-
tion R is the shape with a bottoa fold after the step (W0).

Shape and Size Control of an Artificial Cavity. The application of artificial
air cavities on the bottom of planing vessels for frictional drag reduction is
connected with certain difficulties related to the fact that for siwle botto-
shapes, the cavity length at high speeds becones appreciably greater than the
possible dinensions of the vessel. Accordingly. it become necessary to alter the
shape of the cavity so that it will close on the botton of the vessel.

It is known that in the case of detached cavitating flow over bodies in real fluids
the Iain part of the energy expended on the notion is expanded in the tail section
of the cavity. Here. nonsteady closure of the cavity is observed as a result of
pulsation of its tail section accowanied by escape of gas fro- the cavity in the
case of artificial cavitation. For usual nonsteady closure of a cavity, the gas
flow rate can be large. and it is possible for gas to get into the propulsion mit.

Accordingly, recently efforts have been nsde to find methods of controlling the
shape and site of an artificial cavity which will inure snooth closure of the jets
in the tail section of the cavity and ninieun (theoretically sero) gas coast-mica.

Snooth closure of the jets can be accomlished with negative cavitation nuﬁer in
the tail of the cavity [21] or considering the fact that the fluid has weight
(limiting cavities investigated in §v1n.2).

As was demonstrated above. for planing vessels it is possible to control the cavity
by appropriate selection of the fore of the planing surface. A deficiency of this
lethod of artificial cavity control is that it operates efficiently only at cal-

culated speed. For speeds less than calculated speed, the closure of the cavity
will not be smooth.

Therefore the problem arises of finding methods of shape and size control for an
artificial cavity which will permit cavitating drag reduction and reduction of gas
consunption to s nininun in the largest possible range of speeds.

Noncavitating foils in the tail section of the cavity can be med as one such means
[25].

In order to discover the basic qualitative laws. V. I. Higachev solved the uro-
dinensional problem of unbounded jet flow of an ideal weigxtless fluid over a
wedge in the presence of vorticea sinulsting noncavitating foils, and he investi-
gated the condition mder which snooth closure of the cavity takes place. As a
result of solving this problem. the theoretical possibility of controlling the
cavity characteristics by noncavitating foils was demnstrated (Figure VIII.27).

The solution to the problem of sy-etric flow over a wedge in the presence of
vorticea obtained by V. I. Higachev [22] is also presented below.

For a zero cavitation nulber the cavity cannot be closed in a finite part of the
plane.

From formula (VIII.lOO) it is possible to find that the cavity can be closed only
for r>o. This corresponds to the foil position in Figure “11.1). This is
explained physically by the fact that smooth closure in the tail section of the
cavity is possible only for negative curvature of the cavity in the region which
is observed only with negative pressure gradient (where the pressure drops on
transition from the cavity to the fluid) [21]. The negative pressure gradient. in
turn. is observed when the vortex (or the nose of the foil section) is located

near the cavity boundary md there is no critical point between them, that is.
the condition no is obserVed.

It must be noted that the given flow system is also realized when the vortices are
replaced by discharges.

The flow parameters for o-0.0278 were calculated by formulas (VIII.92)-(VIII.100).
The results of calculating "k and y as a function of a for soft-5.0 and yf-0.2 are
presented in Figure -Vlll.31. As is obvious from the graph, or my cavitation
