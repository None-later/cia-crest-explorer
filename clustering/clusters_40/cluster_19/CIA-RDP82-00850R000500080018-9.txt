[Text] Abstract: A study is nade of the absorption
(mutability) of internal waves in a two-layer
nodal of a stratified fluid with a current near
the free surface. Absorption is deternined by
the critical layer in which the phase velocity
of the wave is close to the current velocity.
Currents snbnerged at a depth seall in conparison
with the thickness of the upper layer are cran-
ined. An expression is derived for the increment
in a linear approrinstion and the nonlinear de-
velopnent of a wave with tihe is;de‘scribed.

A great nuber of studies have now been published on the linear theory of in-
stability in .a stratified medit- [1-3]. In very sinple cases the nonlinear de-
velopment of internal waves can be described on the basis of the general ap-
proach employed for systses with slight nonlinearity [4, 5]. when the in-
stability is detenined by the presence of layers of coincidence (Hiles in-
stability nechanise [6-81) it becones possible to note an analytical study of
highly nonlinear processes of energy exchange between the current and a wave.
In this case the analysis is sinplified because strong nonlinearity is nani-
fested only in the narrow region of the critical layer (CL) [9-12].

In this article we solve the prole of the nonlinear stage of instability
(or absorption of a wave with a finite anplitude) in a two-layer nodal of a
stratified fluid of infinite depth in the presence of a horisontal shear cur-
rent near the surface. The origin of such a current can be. in particular.
related to the directed sovenant of air over the boundary of the upper layer
(wind over the sea surface). An analysis is givan for the vertical scales

of the velocity profile snall in coeparison with the thickness of the less
dense upper layer. The Hiles nechanisn of intensification and absorption of
internal waves is considered. Within the franeworl: of the theory of a crit-
ical layer fornulated in [9-12], a study is ends of the linear and nonlinear
stages in the developnent of a wave with tile; '

As follows free (1) and (23), the scale of the nonetationary critical layer
is dtc' $2 and accordingly, with 6< l and a sufficiently low viscosity there
is satisfaction of the assumption of isolation of the critical layer.

Expression (23) shows that waves with a resonance point situated in the region

u"(z)>o attenuate (Y<0). whereas waves with “c"<° are intensified (Y) 0).
This result, naturally, agrees with the criterion of Niles instability for
gind waves 56. 8]. Figure 2 shows the dependence of the nor-sliced increeent

fornnated above because in this case the critical layer region eerges with

the boundary. The “2 profiles having a flexure point evidently can arise when
there is a variable wind. If the velocity of the infinitely long waves is less
than the velocity flow at the fleaure point (c-<0.63), all the waves attenu-
ate (l'ig. 2,b, curve 1). However, when is greater than the velocity at the
flexure point an instability arises. "1:: c.<l disturbances in the long-wave
part of the spectra are unstable. With a decrease in wavelength the resonance
point is displaced downward along the s-axis and after it passes through the
flexure point the increnent changes sign (rig. 2,b, curve 2). The behavior of
Y with k 8 his shown in Fig. 2,b by a dashed line. In order to deternine Y in

this region it is necessary to go beyond the fralework of appr'oxination of an
isolated critical layer.

System (19), (20) makes it possible to examine such an essentially nonlinear
development of internal waves. when dv/dt >1 it is possible to use the re-

91:1 to of solution (20), obtained for stationery critical layers [9, 10]. For
such a critical lager the logaritl- phase jump is dependent only on the one

parameter )9 - (1‘, Id“3 [10]. The dependence of Q on the dimensionless amplie
tude s - 3‘ 2/3 is approximated well by a simple formula [12]. After trans-
formation t8 dimensionless time ‘t -IY|t, from (19), (20) and (22) we obtain

For the attenuation of waves (u ">0) the nonlinearity in the critical layer
is manifested in the fact that intensive waves attenuate to a lesser degree
than is predicted by linear theory. However, with a decrease in wave amplitude
the decrement tends to a "linear" value. when u¢"< 0 the increment of increase
of a weak wave (s(o)< 1) decreases smoothly with an increase in amplitude from
Y to zero. The scale of the critical layer region in this case increases (dn
- sl/zdv). A violation of the initial assumption (2) of nerrowness of the
critical layer should lead to a qualitative change in the process of develop-
ment of instability. The amplitude of the vertical displacement of the density

It can be seen from (25) that in the case which we considered of thin critical
layers (d n v<g) the displacements of the jump are small in comparison with
the thickness of the upper layer (A< 1).

In accordance with (26). the approximation of a quasistationary critical layer
is satisfied-with small a. with sufficiently large a, when av3/dc3<1, vis-
cosity in the critical layer can be neglected. Such a limiting case can be ex-
amined within the framework of the theory formulated above if Id: - l with
a - £*<l. In the nonviscous critical layer the motion of the luid is conven-

iently described in Lagrangian form [11]. After introducing the normalized co-
ordinates of particles

x - a/zn/k and z n7/2nat,

the amplitudes N - an/dlz and the time tr. from (19). (20) we obtain a system
of equations examined in [11]. Its numerical solution shows that in the pres-
ence of instability a weak wave (N(0)‘l) at first increases exponentially
with a Y increment. with N S 9.6 all the fluid particles participating in
energy exchange with the wave experience rotations on the plane (x,2) with the
characteristic frequency IYI *. As a result, the instability is stabilized

ison with dt‘ 2“ - zminz lo and ‘max - sums-r25“ [ll].

and weak oscillations of wave amplitude arise. In such a regime the transition
corresponds to the amplitude of oscillations of. the density jump

'A-««'(1—"i"'~;;" .

 

As a result of the rotation of fluid particles the vorticity level lines in

the critical layer are twisted into spirals and small-scale oscillations arise

on the 5 profile. The period of oscillations decreases until viscosity becomes

operative, this smoothing the vorticity profile* . The nonlinear regime of wave

attenuation (uc ").o) is realized when 8(0)}bl. In this case resonance particles
are immediately captured by a wave, whose amplitude begins to oscillate weakly

[12].

Thus, a current localized near the surface, depending on the type of velocity
profile, can both absorb and intensify internal waves. The slight submergence
of the current makes it possible to speak of an interaction with the flow

of internal waves,found in its absence. In this sense the formulated theory
for internal waves is similar to that known for wind instability [6, 8]. In-
teraction with a near-surface current is a strong mechanism of absorption
(intensification) of internal waves because the increment is a value of the
order of l,/h of wave frequency. Instability is possible in the presence of a
velocity profile flexure point when the velocities of infinitely long waves
are greater than the current velocity at the flexure point. If the velocity
of infinitely long waves exceeds the velocity at the surface, the instability
is displaced into the short-wave region. The behavior of the wave in the non-
linear stage is greatly dependent on the turbulent viscosity value and on the
depth of flow submergence.

[Text] Abstract: Equations for optimum evaluations
of the principal hydrophysical fields in the
ocean and for the coveriationel matrix of
errors in the evaluation are given. Approx-
inste methods are proposed for computing the
the cross-covariational functions of errors
of functionally related fields. The remlts
of modal numerical experinents for evaluat-
ion of "m‘easnteaents" of both individual
paraneters and combinations of parameters
in a four-dimensional analysis of ocean

fields are given.

In the continuous four-dimensional analysis of hydrophysicsl fields in the
ocean use is made of the following sequence of operations [1): determination
of initial fields; prediction of fields and statistical characteristics on
the basis of a thernohydrodynanic model; correction of prediction by observ-
ationsl data (obtaining initial data for further prediction). Independently
it is possible to carry out an analysis of several fields (density, horisontal
components of current velocity), in conputing the field of any parameter
proceeding solely on the basis of the measured values of this parsneter [1,
2]. Another approach involves computation of each hydrophysical element on
the basis of information on the coﬁination of such elmlents; the computation
ale-ant my or may not be included in this combination. Such an approach can

be called multielemsnt four-dimensional analysis of hydrophysical fields in
the ocean [3].

In this article we give equations for multielsment four-dinensional analysis
of the principal hydrophysicsl fields in the ocean. We also give methods for
computing the cross-covariationel functions of errors of functionally related

tribution of "neuursaents" of specific hydrophysical paraseters to their
analyuis and the possibilities of reconstructing fields on the basis of

Pig. 1. Sequence and number of observation stations for density and current
velocity fields on each day of model time.

As the true fields we used the hydrophysical fields computed in an inertial
forecast (with constant lateral boundary vsluesp) for five days of model time.
He used equations (6)-(lO) with the boundary conditions (ll)-(l3). As the in-
itial equations we took the fields corresponding to the initial density field.
obtained on the basis of observational data from the second density survey
carried out in the POLMDB polygon [ll]. Observational data were generated
fron this true state each 26 hours (see Fig. 1).

In subsequent computations as the initial density field we used the initial
field ﬁ averaged on the basis of the nearest four points within the region and
two at the lateral boundaries. At the lateral boundaries the density changed
linearly from the smoothed value on the first day to the true value on the last
day. The following variants of computations for five days of model time were
used.

In the preliminary experiment (PE) a purely hydrodymmic prediction of field
evaluations was made. In the first experiment (I), in addition to a predic-
tion of evaluations of the fields for each day there was assimilation of data
from observations of the u, v components of current velocity. In this procedure
in formulas (15). (16) beneath the smation symbol we keep the first two terms
and in formula (17) the last term on the right-hand side is neglected. In the
second experinent (II) the density evaluation was corrected using observational
data on velocity in explicit form (the indicated term was taken into account in
(17)). In variants I. II there was a two-element four-dinenaionsl analysis of
oceanic fields. In the third (III) and fourth (IV) experiments there was a
single-element four-dimensional analysis using msursment data only for the
density field. '

The fifth experiment (V) was carried out with simultaneous allowance for ob-
servational data on the velocity and density fields. The covariation Intrix
P” (x, x', t) was computed as in [2].

ue of the field on the fifth day of nodal tine; ‘P is the field value ob-
tained in the course of an experiment in this same t period. The table
gives the results of the nunsrical experiments. The figures in __the parentheses
indicated by what percent the considered values of the errors 3‘ . 3' max and
0‘ were improved relative to the similar errors in the PB.

It can be seen that the assimilation of measure-ent data only for the velocity
field leads to an insignificant inrovement in the results of four-dimensional
analysis of the velocity and density fields. At the sane tine experiment III
shows that with the assimilation of infornation on the density field the
errors 5 . 8m and 0' for the velocity and density fields decrease signif-
icantly. This is also confined by experiments IV and V. The conclusion can
be drawn that the principal factor in the process of reconstruction of the
principal hydrophysical fields in the ocean in the case of their four-dimen-
sional analysis is the density field. within the framework of the conducted
model experinents the correction to a field. informtion on whose measure-
nents is lacking, by neasurement data for other fields in explicit for: on
the average is insignificant (see experiments II, IV). In individual regions
of the polygon, as indicated by an analysis of the results of conputations,

it can be substantial. Minim- values of the errors 3' , 5 max and 0' are ob-
served vith the simultaneous assimilation of neasurement data for the density
and velocity fields (experiment V).

[Text] Abstract: Heasurenents of internal waves by
nsans of drifting and towed arrays of dis-
tributed tenpereture sensors are described.
The work was carried out in the MM!
polygon in Septder 1977. The correlation
between the directions of waves in trains
of short-period waves and thermcline slopes
is indicated. It is postulated that the re-
fraction of internal waves and nonlinear
effects arising during the propagation of
waves over the sloping themcline play an
isportsnt role in the generation of trains
of short waves sisilar to those appearing
during the nonlinear decay of an internal
tidal wave arriving in shallow waters.

Arrays of distributed taperature sensors in drifting [1] and towed variants
have been used in studying the spatial structure of trains of short-period
internal waves frequently encountered in the upper thernocline and their
correlation with synoptic variability of the ocean. The studies were carried
out in the rumour polygon during the period 6-9 Septeaber 1977 siaultaneous-
1y on the scientific research ships ”Petr stedev" (drifting array) and ”Ser-
gey Vavilov" (towed array).

The principal elenent of the array - the distributed temperature sensor --
was Isde of a cable with steel strands whose resistance varied proportionally
to the nsan t-perature of the water layer intercepted by the sensor. As a
result of such averaging properties the distributed tenperature sensor is in-
sensitive to the distorting influence of the fine structure of the vertical
distribution of temerature in the ocean [2] and this nines it possible

to carry out both phase and amplitude comparisons of the readings of spa-
tially separated sensors, that is. to use array methods for evaluating

the spatial-temporal spectrum of waves [3]. The readings of the distributed
temperature sensors were converted into the vertical displacements relative
to the thermocline by means of the experimentally evaluated response of the
distributed temperature sensors to the known vertical displacement, as a rule
stable during the entire course of the measurements.

The drifting array, consisting of four loo-m distributed temperature sensors,
spaced horizontally. was supplemented by a "stepped" sensor of four ZO-m dis-
tributed temperature sensors for evaluating the vertical variability of the
waves and three BPV-Z current meters for determining movements of the array
relative to the water (Pig. 1).

The towed array included three bO-m distributed temperature sensors. at whose
ends there were hydrodynamic deepeners of the lattice type. One sensor (C)
was submerged from the stern, and the other two were deflected by means of
torpedo-shaped floats along the wake (K) and in a direction away from the
ship (B) (Fig. 2). In the latter case the float was supplied with a special
line ensuring deflection under the influence of the oncoming flow.

Figure 3 shows the position of the runs which were carried out against the
background of relief of the 15' isotherm, characterizing the position of the
synoptic eddies during the course of the experiment (the map was compiled on
the basis of data from a temperature survey carried out during the period
9-11 September 1977). The track of the scientific research ship "Petr Lebed-
ev" with a drifting array is also shown here. Figure 3 shows that the region
of the measurements was situated for the most part in a transition region
between cyclonic and enticyclonic eddies and only run V intercepted an anti-
cyclonic formation. The discreteneas of the measurements was 30 sec and was
equal to the time constant of the distributed temperature sensor at the 0.7
level. The basic information on the towing runs is given in Table 1.

Pressure sensors of the vibrotron type with a sensitivity of aJIO cm were
mounted at the ends of the distributed pressure sensor. These made possible
a reliable checking of the change in depth and choice of sectors with small
depth variations. Substantial changes in depth (up to S m) during towing
were observed only during changing of the runs, but some increase in coher—
ence between the readings of the distributed temperature detectors and the
depth of its lower end at frequencies of 12-15 cycles/hour made it necessary
to use caution in examining data for this frequency range (in the subsequent
processing the data were smoothed by moving averaging in six ordinates. that
is, with a smoothing interval of 3 min). At frequencies from 0.51 to 10-12
cycles/hour the coherence was close to zero and the spectral density of os-
cillations of the end of the distributed temperature sensor was 1-1.5 orders
of magnitude less than the spectral density of readings of the distributed
temperature sensor.

The situation is different with respect to fluctuations in the depth of the
drifting array, when sporadic squalls have led to sharp intensifications
of drift and a decrease in the depth of the distributed temperature sensor.

the oscillations at different depths. The latter circumstance very convincingly
confirms the fact of a predominance of the lower mode because-a distributed
temperature sensor with a length of 100 n, by virtue of averaging in a thick
layer. filters out oscillations of the higher nodes and creates the illusion

of a predominance of a lower mode in places where this is not actually the
case. however. the fact of a dominance of the first mode of high-frequency
oscillations in the upper thermocline is not new and is easily explained,

since the higher modes attenuate rapidly due to the small thickness of the
waveguide.

waves are linited to the northwest quadrant. Such a unidirectionslity of the
wave spectrum, registered with a drifting array. is all the more meaningful

in that it contrasts sharply with the broad scatter of directions of waves

in trains encountered during the towing of the distributed temperature sensor.
In Fig. 6 we illustrate these trains: the smoothed change in depth of the

straight line over the axis of time and distances in Pig. 6 and by the ship
symbols in Fig. 7. The smoothed curves of change in the depth of the thereo-
cline along the ship's course on the counterruns II and III were matched so

III and IV (see Figures 3 and 7). The absolute depth scale is related to the
smoothed curves and to the train A (run 1); only the vertical scale is indi-
cated for the remaining trains. 0n run V. being a continuation of run IV and
not shown in Fig. 6. there was a further deepening of the therlocline to 39 I
with some rising (t0‘35 s) toward the end of the run. A peculiarity of run v
was the absence of clearly expressed trains and a general decrease in the dis-
persion of the high-frequency oscillations.

A comparison of counterruns II and III lakes it possible to evaluate the time
variability of the smoothed depth of the therlocline. The characteristic flex-
ure of the therlocline. observed on both runs, was displaced to the north

during the time between runs at a mean rate of 0.5 n/sec. which is too small
for internal waves of such a length (100 km), which could be considered the
reason for the detected variability. Evidently here there are synoptic inhono-
geneitiea of the thernoclina transported by the current. Asauning that all the
other smoothed changes observed on runs I-V were oueed by relatively slowly
noving synoptic inhomgeneities,we attempted to construct the pattern of depth
of the thernocline with tine and at the place of towing, shown in Fig. 7.

He will now return to the trains of short waves A-G encountered during towing
and shown in Pig. 6. A col-on feature of these trains, consisting of several
waves, is the close affinity with a marked deepening of the thernocline, which
resembles the situation arising during the nonlinear decay of waves over shal-
low water [6]. The highest waves (up to 3 n) were discovered on run I (train
A); the height of the waves in the remaining trains did not exceed 1.5-2 a.
(In a conparison of the apparent periods of the waves in different trains it
must be taken into account that the rate of towing on run I was 3-4 tines
lower than on the renining runs.)

General information on the trains and paraneters of the waves, determined by
neans of spatial-tenporal spectral analysis by the maxim probability method,
is given in Table 2 and the corresponding wave vectors I: are shown in the
for- of arrows near the schematic representations of the ship in Fig. 6. As

a comparison, at the upper right we have shown a .vector directed to the north
whose length corresponds to II: I- 0.5 cycle/kn. In those cases when the tine
periodogran of the train contained not one, but two peaks close in value. as
was the case in trains D, E and P. two wave vectors have been shown, this re-
flecting the complex spatial-reworal structure of the train.

The lengths of the waves in the trains for the most part vary about 2 kn; the
true periods on the average were close to a half-hour*. No direction can be
called predominant, in contradiction to the observations in the case of a
drifting array. The reason for such an inconsistency in the results lust evi-
dently be sought in the spatial variability of the directions since the neas-
urements with the drifting array were carried out in a localized region,
whereas towing was carried out over a relatively great area (see Fig. 7). In
particular, this is indicated by the good agreement between the directions of
the waves in trains B and P encountered during the time of towing near the
place of drift of the scientific research ship "Petr Lebedev" and neasurenent
data from the letter.

The directions of the waves in different trains, registered with the towed
distributed temperature array, can be explained by a conparison of the ob-
served pattern with the relief of the thereocline (Pig. 7). In actuality. when
waves of any direction run onto a sloping thernocline their direction under
the influence of refraction will approach the normal to the thermocline iso-
baths, much as is the case with surface waves in the coastal zone. Refraction

 

* The high rate of towing (in comparison with the phase velocity of the waves)

is responsible for the low accuracy in evaluating the true frequency; this evi-
dently also explains the great scatter of the determined periods and phase vel-
ocities.

occurs because the phase velocity c of the considered waves for all practical
purposes is determined only by the depth of the thernocline, and not I)? the
total depth of the ocean. (In a two-layer case, for exanple, c: gh ,9 P,

where g is the acceleration of gravity, h is the depth of the interface be-
tween layers with the densities p1 and p , Ap- p - P1, Peﬁl, p2. Hith
the observed differences in the depth of the theme ine the phase velocity
changes by 202. This evidently also explains the stable predoninance of the
northwesterly noving waves discovered by the scientific research ship "Petr
Lebedev," which drifted near the steep slope of the thernocline, rising in this
direction.

If the height of the onconing waves is not negligible in comparison with the
depth of the thernocline the nonlinear effects deternined by the nonlinearity
paraneter 6 ' a/h, where a is wave amplitude, becone important. This pare-
neter, in essence, deterninea the difference in velocities at the crest and
in the trough of an internal wave traveling along a shallow thernocline.
Since, in contrast to a surface wave in shallow waters, an internal wave is
not "braked" by the botton, but by the ocean surface, its trough, nore distant
free the surface, travels with the velocity c reater than the velocity of
the crest ccro Cu. - ,/gAah+a5/p> ccr -/gAp Zh-a)7p , and overtakes the
crest, increasing the steepness of the rear slope of the wave. Finally, the
rear slope of the wave acquires the character of an internal front (bore),
accoapanied by a singular train of short waves which are "released" by the
hora as it moves and gradually lag behind it due to dispersion. A similar
phenonenon over'a sloping shallow botton was uanined in [lo] and has been ob-
served repeatedly in nature (for exalple, see [5, 6]).

It is understandable that the described effects are the stronger the shallower
the thernocline and possibly precisely for this reason the trains were not ob-
served on run V, where the thernocline depths were Intim- (35-39 a) and the
slopes were nininu. Aasuing the anplitude of the bore-forning waves to be

3 n, we obtain 5 - 3/22 - 0.16 (at the beginning of run I) and 5m - 3/39
- 0.08 (in the niddfe of run V), that is, the nonlinearity parameter changes by
alnost a factor of 2 with a rather significant nean value. A definite role is
evidently also played by the decrease in the slopes of the thernocline because
the narrowing of the angular spectrun of waves, as a result of refraction, is
the weaker the lesser the slope of the thernocline and therefore whereas large
slopes of the thermcline lead to a refraction concentration of waves along
one direction (upslope) and thereby lead to an increase in the height of bore-
foraing waves, in the case of snall slopes these effects are expressed to a
lesser degree, that is, nonlinear phenonena also attenuate.

In general, the following picture is observed: running onto a sloping therno-
cline, the waves, under the influence of refraction, acquire a direction up-
slope and experience a nonlinear transfornation, leading to the fornation of
a bore and acconpanying trains of short waves. Naturally, the direction of
the waves in these trains is close 'to the direction of the bora-forning waves
propagating upslope. Such bore-forning waves can be present also in the back-
ground, possibly quasi-isotropic field of internal waves, which becones ani-
sotropic, being refracted over irregularities of the thernocline. hecisely
the anisotropisation of the background field over the thernocline, rising

toward the northwest, evidently also explains the observed stable predominance
of northwesterly directions of the waves in a broad frequency range of a more
or less monotonically decreasing spectrua (see Figures 6 and 5). The simultan-
eous existence of two systems of waves in some trains (D, E, P) agrees with
the earlier observed facts of a complex structure of the trains accompanying
the bars [5].

The proposed hypothesis of a correlation of the trains of short-period inter-
nal waves frequently encountered in the upper layer of the ocean and the re-
lief of the thermocline finds indirect confirmation in the well-known facts of
intensification of such waves near fronts (for example, see [7]). It is inter-
esting that the considered mechanism even explains such earlier-noted pecul-
iarities of short-period internal waves as the possibility of their quasi-
standing character, even under the conditions prevailing in the open ocean
[I], to which must be added the refraction of background isotropic waves on
extended rises of the thermocline.

Thus, the phenomenon of formation of trains of powerful waves (related to the
shelf), in the case of nonlinear decay of an internal tidal wave in shallow
water. possibly has its analogy in the open ocean in the form of formation of
trains over the thermocline with a changing depth. Since synoptic nonuniform-
ities of depth of the upper thermocline occur widely. the development of more
or less significant trains of short-period internal waves, directed up the
slope of the thermocline. can be a frequently encountered phenomenon in the
ocean.

[Text] One of the pronising directions in the development of narine geophysics
at the resent time is the study and allowance for the influence of some fine
effects rising due to different processes in the water layer of the ocean.
This direction can also be traced in such methods as nagnetonetry [l] and
gravinetry [2, 3] which in the past have traditionally not taken the influence
of the water layer into account. In this article we wish to note one effect

we will visualize that in a homogeneous gravitational field characterised by

a constant vertical potential gradient (3 11/6: - const ~ r) and. accordingly.
by parallel and equidistant equipotential surfaces, there is none inhomogeneous
nediun of a low viscosity in which for some reasons (thermal factors, compres-
sibility in the gravity field. etc.) there is a vertical density gradient whose
value will also he considered constant (dd/d: - const). Surfaces of equal den-
sities (isopycnic surfaces) will coincide with the isopotential surfaces. that
is, in this case will he represented by horizontal planes (Fig. 1). At some
point in this medium we will place the origin of coordinates (the penis is
directed vertically downward) and at this point we will place the values of

the gravitational potential and density respectively 00 and 0'0. Then for each
point in the median these values will he expressed as

U-U.+1s. efs.9(do/dr)a

we will sxanine what will occur if at the origin of coordinates we place some
point mass H. which we call an anomaly. Its appearance gives rise to an anon-
alous gravitational field having the potential P - fli/r (where f is the gravi-
tational constant, r is the distance to the origin of coordinates) and the
gravitational acceleration Aga - -ﬂu/r3. In turn. the appearance of anon-
alous potential leads to the vertical displacement of iaopotential surfaces by
the value g... - ./()’+Ag.). The isopycnic surfaces are displaced by the sale
value, due to the low viscosity of the nediun following the iaopotential sur-
faces. As a result of this. at each point in the nediun there will be an in-
crease in density caused by displacement of the iaopycnic line by the value

Expression (1) shove that the appearance of the ans-alone lass H in the gradient
nediun causes a restructuring of the density field and the fornetion because of
this of the additional use a, Ihoea value is dependent on the M paranater. and
also on the extent of the region occupied by the nedim. as well as the value
of its density gradient. The influence of this additional use is expressed

in the appearance of an additional gravitational field. spherically syI-etric
and concentric with the anonaloue field of the gas a and having the potential

dot-dash lines represent iaopotential (and isopycnic) surfaces corresponding
to a honoganeous field; the solid lines represent the sane in the presence of
an anomalous lass H; the dashed lines represent isolines of anomalous poten-
tial.

Thus. it appears that the gravitational field of an anonalous nasa (potential
and its derivatives) in a gradient aediun sonevhat exceeds in its intensity a
field of the sane uses in a nediun honogeneoua in density. Since this effect
arises due to a corresponding organisation of the nediun occurring under the
influence of the anoealous nass itself. we called it the affect of self-en-
hancenent of gravitational anonaliee in gradient nadia.

‘l‘uo circustancea should be .phasised. first. the noted effect arises in both
gradient and in densityo-etratifiad nedia. in a liniting case -- in a two-layer
aadiu. The sole condition for the appearance of the effect in this case is
that the viscosity of nattar aust be sufficiently eeall that the density boun-
daries will adhere to the equipotentiel surfaces of the gravity field. Second,
this effect also arises in a case when the anonaloue mass is situated outside
the gradient nadiu. In other words, the additional ease in the. gradient or
stratified nediua arises under the influence of any gravitating object dis-
rupting the honogeneity of the field in this aediua.

This expression makes it possible to evaluate the described effect in some
specific cases. In particular, we will examine its possible manifestation in
an ocean whose water thickness can be represented as a gradient medium in den-
sity respects.

Assuming for do'ldz a value l-lO'6 g'cm" (frequently observed in the ocean,
although somewhat exaggerated for the water layer as a whole) [6], we find
that for R - 5 km the relative self-enhancement of gravitational anomalies at
the ocean surface should be about 1-10", that is. 0.01: (an anomaly of 100
mgal is intensified by 0.01 mgal). This value. to be sure, is too small to be
of importance for experimental gravimstric investigations in the ocean. How-
ever, for oceanological practice another aspect of the described effect can
be important, specifically, the increase in the density of sea water horizon-
tally in the direction of greater values of the anomalous gravitational field
necessary for its appearance.

Elementary computations show that the free-air anomalies observed at the ocean
surface with a characteristic amplitude of 50 mgal [5] correspond to an incre-
ment of gravity potential in the water layer of about 1.105'sec'2, that is, the
magnitude of displacement of the isopotential (and isopycnic) surfaces is about
10 cm. Hith the above-mentioned sea water density gradient (Vertically) this
gives a density increment (horizontally) of about 1°10‘4 gccm3 or in the first
place after the decimal point in the so-called nominal density of sea water

(a parameter adopted in oceanology and equal to £73 - (cf; l)-lO3 g'cm'3).
Such changes are exrremely significant and without question can be detected
during hydrophysical measurements in the ocean and taken into account in com-
puting currents by the dynamic method [6, 7]. It should be noted that there
are some still unpublished data on the presence of a quite close correlation
between the density values for sea water at different horizons and gravity
anomalies (a. H. Boyarinov, S. V. Protsayenko. personal communication); these
can serve as unquestionable.auppoatuin.favor of the existence of‘the self-en-
hancement effect for gravitational anomalies in the ocean.

An important feature in the appearance of the described effect in the ocean is
that gravitating objects, including those situated deep beneath the ocean
floor, lead to the forming of an inhomogeneous structure of isopycnic (and ac-
cordingly. isobaric) surfaces in the water layer. as a result of which there
are unequal conditions for the passage of water masses associated with gravi-
tational anomalies. It is easy to see that more favorable conditions for this
prevail in regions where the distance between these surfaces is maximum, that
is, in places where the additional gravitational potential is minimum. In this
connection it can be expected that ocean currents in principle should gravitate
toward regions of negative gravitational anomalies. This effect probably should

SEISMIC NOISE AT OCEAN FLOOR

Moscow now AXADEMII NAUK SSSR in Russian Vol 263, No 5. Apr 82 (manuscript

[Text] Recently seismic investigations in the ocean have been requiring use of
increasingly more complex observation systems. including up to 10 or more bot-
tom seismographs. The rational planning of these extremely costly experiments
requires information on the level and spectral composition of bottom seismic
noise, limiting the effective response of receiving-recording apparatus situ-
ated at the ocean floor or near it. The vigorous development of technology and
the method for seismic investigations with bottom seismographs during the last
20 years has favored the registry of bottom noise phenomena in the USSR

and abroad [1-5]. However, this information, obtained by the scientists of
different countries with the use of various kinds of apparatus. with the use of
different processing methods and forms of representation of the noise spectra,
is difficult to compare and is frequently contradictory.

At the Institute of Oceanology. USSR Academy of Sciences. seismic investigations
with bottom seismographs have been carried out since 1965. Although the prin-
cipal purpose of these studies was deep seismic sounding of the earth's crust
and upper mantle, incidentally extensive material on bottom noise was obtained
in the frequency range 2-20 hr. The investigations covered all the principal
tectonic structures of the floor of the world ocean - internal and urginal
seas, ocean basins and major rises within their limits, mid-oceanic ridges and
the areas surrounding them. and block ranges. The observations were made under
the moat diversified hydrometeorological conditions. Noise was registered using
instruments of the sane type (bottom seismographs designed at the Physics Fac-
ulty of Moscow State University and the Institute of Oceanology, USSR Academy
of Sciences) and processed by the same method. making it possible to carry out
a joint analysis and statistical processing of the experimental spectra.

The analysis was made using the 59 most representative magnetic records of seis-
mic noise obtained on expeditions of the Institute of Oceanology, USSR Academy
of Sciences. during the period from 1973 through 1979. The distribution of these
records by research regions is shown in Table l. The bottom seismgraphs were
placed at depths from 210 to 6520 m. The duration of the continuous registry at '
the bottom varied from 1 to 10 days, depending on the purpose of the experiment

of bottom seienogrsphs with an extent of about 3 minutes, free of seismic
waves caused by known artificial and natural sources (shots. pneumatic redia-

iment, earthquakes).

The spectra of bottom seismic noise were obtained using an analog l/3-octave

root of the spectral density of intensity of the investigated signal w in the

a reliability coefficient 0.95, which use adequate for the purposes of this

widely, which makes it possible to judge the characteristics of bottom noise

Figure 1 shows the statistically mean spectrum generalized for all the deter-
mined values. The spectral density values at frequencies of 2, 3, 6, 6, 8, 10
and 20 Hz were computed as the mean arithmetical value of 59 individual spec-

of the high frequencies. The nean curve agrees well with the spectre obtained
by T. Asada and H. Shimamura [5].

Figure 1 shows that the deviations of the spectra of real noise from the stat~
istical mean can be significant (for the limiting case by a factor of 6), tak~
ing in a range of 1-1.5 orders of magnitude. The lower curve is at the level
of weakest bottom noise registered earlier and analyzed by D. D. Prentiss and
J. Ewing [2]; the range of change of spectral density for it was from 10'6 to
5'10'8 cm-sec'l-Hz‘l/ at frequencies of 2 and 10 He respectively. The upper
curve passes near the spectra obtained by L. N. Rykunov and V. V. Sedov [l]

on the thickness of the sedimentary cover at the registry points. Two mean
spectra were computed for this purpose: one of these was obtained using data
from the registry of noise in regions with a thickness of sediments less than
300 m (0-300 m). whereas the other was based on data for regions with a thick-
ness of sediments greater than 300 m (300—6000 m). Information on the thick-

teined using materials from continuous seismic profiling and deep seismic
sounding on corresponding expeditions; the sedimentary stratum includes rocks

half. This made it possible to compute the mean spectra with a greater accur-
acy than each individual spectrum, thereby making it possible to consider the
difference in the resulting mean spectra to surpass the errors in measuring

We also analyzed the dependence of the mean level of bottom seismic noise on
hydrometeorological conditions. As a point of departure we used the well-known
fact of an intensification of cyclonic activity in the oceans in autumn and

bl

spring in comparison with the summer period. A study of the experimental data
indicated that in many cases more intense but briefer changes in the noise
level caused by other factors (bottom currents, sea transport. etc.) are super-
posed on seasonal fluctuations of the mean noise level. Thus, the averaging of
the 59 spectra at our disposition made it possible for each frequency to dis—
criminate "long-period" fluctuations of bottom noise (period of about 3 months)
of a low intensity against a background of its sore intense and briefer varia-

tions. Figure 3 shows the mean speztra for spring and autumn (averaging for
24 spectra), and also for summer (averaging for 35 spectra). It can be seen

that during periods of intensificatiee of cyclonic activity in the oceans the
mean level of the bottom seismic noise increases by a factor of approximately

1.5 in the investigated frequency range. The influence of a local cyclone on
the level of bottom seismic noise directly in the region affected by a cyclone
was examined in a separate study [6].

In order to refine and supplement the dependences between bottom seismic noise
on seismogeological and hydrometeorological conditions which have now been
clarified it is necessary to recommend the formulation of planned expedition-

ary investigations of this problem, preferably in a broader frequency range
(from 0.1 to 100 Hz).

[Text] Ocean turbulence. together with other factors, plays an important role
in forming of ocean surface characteristics. Turbulent heat conductivity of
water is one of the important paraneters dsternining ocean surface tenpera-
ture. Turbulent velocity fluctuations, interacting with wave novenents of
fluid, exert an influence on roughness of the water surface. However, the con-
cepts concerning the discontinuous distribution of turbulence in the ocean pre-
vailing only recently should lead to the conclusion that there is a unifornity
of these nsnifestetions of turbulence over great expenses of the ocean. But ex-
tensive observations of ocean turbulence carried out during recent years have
shown that it is characterised by a strong intereittence: zones of turbulent
fluid alternate in the ocean with sectors in which the observed resins of water
notion is close to laninar [1]. In this connection, nanifestations of turbu-
lence at the ocean surface should have a "spotty" structure which. in general.
can be detected by both contact and renote nethods.

In [2] the author proposed a nodel of vertical turbulent exchange in the ocean
in the presence of turbulence internittent with depth. According to this nodel
the mean value of the coefficient of vertical exchange K is described by the

expression _-_.--

He will evaluate the possible statistical scatter of the K values caused by
the turbulence intermittance effect. In the case of a Poisson distribution of

and evaluations of the mean square scatter of K values in accordance with
formula (2) with the use of the experimental data enumerated in [2] in order of

we will examine how variations of the coefficient of vertical turbulent exchange
are manifested in the taperatura field of the ocean surface. We will consider
the coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusivity K41- to be proportional to the
coefficient of turbulent exchange of momentum K with the proportionality fac-
tor at (of the order of 0.1) and we will mains the nonstationary problem of
the propagation of heat from the surface into the depths of the ocean. describ-

In accordance with (10), with a variation of Kr and t in the ranges from 1.4-
10‘3 to 101 cmzlsec and from 1 minute to 10 hours the '0 value varies in the
range from 0.9 cm to 19 m, as a result of which the adopted boundary condition
(a) with z-ooo must be considered justified.

Thus, the scatter of values of the coefficient of vertical turbulent exchange
caused by the intermittence of turbulence can lead to substantial variations
of ocean surface temperature (the model considered above, not taking the hori-
zontal nonuniformity of the temperature field and horizontal turbulent heat
exchange into account, can be used because the horizontal dimensions of indi-
vidual turbulent zones in the ocean are usually much greater than their thick-
ness). And since there will alternately be more and then less turbulent layers
of fluid in different regions of the ocean near its surface. the temperature
field of the ocean surface acquires a “mosaiced” structure. Accordingly.

the temperature drops between adjacent spots in such a structure will be de-
pendent on the differences in the turbulence levels in the surface layers of
the ocean and on the lifetime of the turbulent layers. Evidently. 1 hour can
be used as the characteristic (in order of magnitude) lifetime of the approx-
imately constant turbulence level in individual layers. Then with molecular
vertical heat exchange in one of the ocean zones and with a value KT - 10 cm2/
sec in the adjacent zone the drop in surface temperaiure between these zones
13? attains l.8°C. However, if in one zone KT - 1 cm /sec. and in the other KT
- 10 cmzlsec, 13? after the elapsing of 1 hour will be only 0.046’C. With quite
typical values KT - 0.1 cn2/sec in one zone and - l cm2/sec in the other All
attains values 0.15'C. According to [3]. the typical dimensions of spatial in-
homogeneities of ocean surface temperature in the ocean in calm weather are
1-10 km. whereas the temperature between adjacent spots can differ by l-2’C.
However. according to observations made in a number of regions in the North
Atlantic under different weather conditions. the typical All'values at dis-
tances of about 1 km were 13 T - 0.06-0.20’C [6].

The different turbulence of the upper layer of the ocean must also exert an in-
fluence on the characteristics of surface waves. True. in most cases the waves
themselves are the principal factor in the turbulence of this layer and there-
fore they must be in some dynamic equilibrium with the turbulence generated by
them. however, if turbulence is generated by other factors (such as shear in-
stability of the current) or the boundary of some turbulent ldyer under the
influence of diffusional or ndvective processes advances into the zone occupied
by wave motion. there will be a process of interaction between waves and such
"external" turbulence. If there is a gradient grad B in the layer of wave move-
ment.in the density distribution of the energy of potential wave movement E a

flow of wave energy arises which is directed against the gradient and is equal
to [5]

’"K‘WE' (11)

where KB is the coefficient of exchange of wave energy. which can be considered
equal to the coefficient of turbulent exchange of momentum K.

Thus. "external" turbulence causes an outflow of wave energy in a downward di-
rection. which should lead to an attenuation of surface wave amplitude. Such
an effect of extinction of gravitational waves due to strong interaction with

"external" turbulence was noted for the first time by C. I. larenblatt [6. 7].

It can be assumed approximately that a decrease in the amplitude of a wave with
the length 1, occurs at a depth equal to 1/2; in this case the energy decreas-
es by a factor of e at the depth ﬁle. On the basis of expression (16). Table 1
gives estimates of the time intervals ('during which the energy density of sur-
face uaves is reduced to one-quarter of the initial energy density Bo. Depend-
ing on the value of the K coefficient and the A parameter (Table 1 gives the
corresponding values I, - All) the time interval '6 changes in a vide range;

the attenuation of the short-wave part of the wind wave spectrum occurs most
rapidly in this case. Such an effect should lead to the "spottiness" of the
wave field at the ocean surface.

There are a number of assumptions and simplifications in the constructions cited
above. In particular, in a model of vertically intermittent turbulence the as-
sumption was made that there is a statistical uniformity of the process, al-
though the upper layer of the ocean is usually more turbulent than the under-
lying water masses. The schemes for computing the influence of intermittent

turbulence on surface temperature and sea waves are also simplified.

We note in conclusion that the determined orders of magnitude graphically il-
lustrate the important role of the turbulence intermittence factor not taken
into account up to the present time in the forming of the structural features
of hydrophysical fields in the surface layer of the ocean.

Research held at the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio
Have Propagation, USSR Academy of Sciences, in 1978. The collection includes
articles devoted to the development and use of marine mmgnetometric instru-
mentation, investigations of the permanent geomagnetic field related to the
compilation of a catalogue of magnetic surveys, creation of a bank of magneto-
metric data, and also work in the field of a geohistorical analysis of the
earth's anomalous field. In addition, the collection contains a number of ar-
ticles on the theory and practice of marine electromagnetic sounding and pro-
filing, including the development of methods for the numerical and physical
modeling of the electromagnetic field in ocean areas. One of the sections in
the collection is devoted to theoretical and experimental investigations of
electromagnetic fields caused by the movement of water masses. The collec-
tion is of interest to specialists concerned with study of the geomagnetic
field and also for a wide group of geophysicists working in the field of inves-
tigations of the earth's deep structure.

DYNAMIC BAROSENSITIVITY AND TRIBOPOLARIZATION EFFECTS OF MEASUREMENT ELECTRODES

[Text] The errors in the measurement electrodes of the IELAN-IZMIRAN system
caused in a shallow-water zone by the dynamic effect of the waves (pressure.
velocity of flow around the electrodes, wave collapse effect) are experiment-
ally evaluated. Hith a salinity of 132 there is a dynamic barosensitivity of
about 15-SOva/(m N20)-sec'1 and {he tribopolarizatiou for the pair of elec-
trodes is about 50-500 paV/m-sec' . In the case of collapsing crests the ef-
fective value of the dynamic barosensitivity, judging from the form of the
wave, increases by a factor of 4-5. The presence of different kinds of noise,
including with a "long-period" component. of the wave group envelope type. is
demonstrated. The effectiveness of protective measures, including treatment
of the electrodes, is demonstrated. Figures 7, tables 1. references 8.

STATIC BAROSENSITIVITY OF MEASUREMENT ELECTRODES AND EVALUATION OF ERRORS IN

[Abstract of article by Bogorodskiy, H. H.]

[Text] An experimental study was made of the response of silver chloride elec-
trodes to pressure. A special electrolytic pressure chamber outfit was also cre-
ated for this purpose. The author obtained the absolute values of static baro-
sensitivity of the measurement electrodes. It is noted that barosensitivity
anomalies correspond to internal defects of the electrodes. It is shown that it
is possible to evaluate the error in measuring the elements of electric fields
corresponding to the barosensitivity of the electrodes and channel noise. An
evaluation of the errors was made applicable to the potential, vertical dif-
ference and divergent methods for observing the electric fields of Hell-devel-
oped wind waves on a deep sea. The optimum dimensions of the measurement probes
were computed. A decrease in the error can be obtained by treating the elec-
trodes by the cited method in combination vith a decrease in the noise of the
measurement channel. Figures 10. references 22.

[Text] The article gives the results of a spectral-profile analysis of the geo-

vidual anomalous regions. In the spectral structure of the components and the
modulus of strength of the geomagnetic field there are individual spectral

mum value of the relaxation parameter, ensuring rapid convergence of the upper
relaxation iteration method. is determined by means of the prediction and cor-
rection procedures. Provision was made for additional means for accelerat-

ing the process of solution of the problem and checking the accuracy of mod-

GREAT DEPTNS IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN

[Abstract of article by Belyayev. I. I., Polonakiy, Yu. M., Svetov, B. S. and
Khalizov, A. L.]

[Text] This paper gives the results of experiments for registry of variations
of the earth's electric and magnetic fields on the floor of the abyssal
Pacific Ocean carried out in 1978. During the 21st voyage of the scientific
research ship "Dmitriy Hendeleyev" specialists registered variations of the
latitudinal component of the electric field by means of a conduCting line 1

km in length and a magnetic field module using a proton magnetometer. Basic
data are given on the bottom magnetometric station used, as wall as informa- _
ties on formulation of the experiments. The recorded variations are described.

[Text] The authors give the results of a preliminary analysis of magnetic var-
iations on sublatitudinal and meridional magnetic variation profiles in the
Southern Caspian. On the basis of measurements with bottom stations it was
possible to determine the distribution of the normalized amplitudes of vari-
ations of the 2-, H- and D-components. A strong variability of a and D on

the submeridional profile and a weak variability on the sublatitudinal pro-
file were discov. ed. The preliminary interpretation reveals a marked nonuni-
formity of the sedimentary cover in the submeridional direction, in the zone
of contact between the megadepression and the platform, and its slight varia-

bility in a sublatitudinal direction. No asthenospheric inhomogeneities were
discovered. Figures 1. references 3.

THEORY OF OBSERVATION OF UNDERWATER OBJECTS THROUGH WAVE-COVERED SEA SURFACE

[Article by S. V. DA'2enko, Marine Geophysical Institute, Ukrainian Academy of
Sciences]

[Text] Abstract: The article gives a theoretical
analysis of the distortions introduced
by the wave-covered sea surface in the image
of underwater features observed from the at-
mosphere. It is postulated that the spatial
structure of both observed features and
waves has a random character. The quality of
observation is evaluated using the magnitude
of the error in measuring the spatial lumin-
osity of the feature. It is shown that there
is an optinum relationship between the stat-
istical characteristics of the distribution
of luminosity and waves and the parameters
of the measuring instrument ensuring a mini-
mum of this error.

The possibility of observing underwater features from the atmosphere is depend—
ent on their contrast, degree of turbidity of the water and atmosphere, super-
posing of the brightness of air haze, light scattered in the sea and brightness
of the water-air discontinuity on the image [1].

We will investigate the joint influence exerted on transmission of the image of
underwater features by the wave-covered sea surface and the averaging effect of
the measuring instrument, neglecting other interfering factors, allowance for
which is possible independently.

A problem similar in its formulation was sol-ed in [l], where the influence of
the sea surface on image transmission was studied by an analysis of the scat-
tering function, the energy distribution in the edge image and the frequency
contrast of the transfer function. In source [2] a study was made of the image
transfer of a point through a one-dimensional sinusoidal wave and formulas were
given for computing the displacement of a point and the blurring of an object

with an increase in the exposure. An approximate model of image transfer
through the wave-covered discontinuity of two media with different refractive
indices was described in [3], where the author determines the multipoint stat-
istical characteristics of the brightness image of a self-luminescent object
or feature observed through the wave-covered discontinuity.

A feature of this study is that it examines the observation of random spatially
elongated features using optical radiation detectors which perform spatial aver-
aging of the image. Many natural formations on the bottom and in the water lay-
er can be modeled by features of the mentioned structure whose investigation

is possible by optical methods. The spatial averaging of the received image

is a property of any real radiation detector. Accordingly. the combination of
such initial premises makes it possible to obtain research results suitable

for direct practical application. The quality of observation is evaluated us-
ing the mean square error between the initial and measured luminosity distrib-
utions [6]. It is shown that it is dependent on the choice of the degree of
averaging and is the highest when it has a finite value. Here we will examine
observations at the nadir as ensuring minimum image distortion [1].

In order to simplify the analysis we will examine a problem in which the ob-
ject of measurement and waves are assumed to be one-dimensional (Fig. l).

 

Pig. 1. Diagram explaining derivation of principal
relationships.

Retaining the physical essence of the analyzed phenomena. such an approach makes
it relatively simple to obtain final numerical results. The x-axia of the mean
level of the wave—covered surface is stipulated in the figure by the point 0.

The atmosphere is situated above it and the water below. At the depth ll" below
the sea surface there is a diffuse self-luminescent object to be observed, ex-
tending in the direction of the x-axis. whose spatial distribution of luminos-
ity is described by the random function f(-x). At the height H. above the sea
surface at the point 0“ there is a detector of optical radiation whose optical
axis is directed to the nadir. The difference in the level of the wave—covered
surface from the mean is described by a centered random function of the space
coordinate L (It).

An analysis of the process of observation of an underwater feature will be
made on the basis of the premises of geometrical optics without allowance for
the absorption and scattering of light in the water. The ray emerging from
the point A of the observed feature and received by the detector at the point
0" travels the following path. It is propagated in the water medium at the
angle iP to the vertical 38' to the point Q at the water surface. The tangent
CC' to the sea surface at this point is slanted to the horizontal at the angle
at , whereas rne normal NN' to this surface also is deflected by the angle or
from the vertical 88'. At the point Q there is refraction of the ray and it
emerges from the water at the angle ﬂ to the normal NN'. The detector at the
point 0" picks it up arriving at the angle 9 to the vertical.

Since the g (at) surface is curvilinear and random, the picture picked up by
the instrument differs from the f(x) function describing the distribution of
luminosity of the observed object and this difference has a random character.
He will find the error introduced by the wave-covered sea surface and instru—
ment to the image sensed by the latter and we will evaluate the limits 0’ ap—
plicabil ity of such a method for observing underwater objects. For this pur-
pose we will first obtain the correlation between the output signal Y of the
measuring instrument and the investigated object f (x).

We will find the position of the point A, situated on the observed object, which
is sensed by the instrument as visible at the angle 9 to the vertical. The seg-
ment LQ is the 60:) value. Accordingly. the abscissa of the points I. and B is

Since the straight line CC' is the tangent to the £(x) curve at the point
with the abscissa x1, then “(3)

It follows from Fig. 1 that the distance of the point A from the point B is
equal to 2:3 - [I]" + 5 (2:1)] tg 50 . Accordingly, the abscissa of the point A is

where tP- °L+ Y. Equation (1) can be regarded as an equation for finding the

precise solution cannot be obtained. We will take advantage of the circumstance
that in actual practice the amplitude of the wave l; | is much less than
the height "a at which the measuring instrument is situated. From expression

ships. It can be seen that the (50/0)2 value in the case of small 2 with an
increase in z and with the other parameters remaining constant decreases. at-
taining a ninimum with some finite value 2 - ”opt' Accordingly, the measure-
ment error is minimum not with an infinitely narrow directional diagram of the
optical detector, but with some finite width. Such an increase in accuracy with
an increase in z - Rx/r is associated with the spatial filtering of the image
by the detector. An inc‘ease in 2 leads to an averaging of both the luminosity
distribution of the object f(x) and the observed wave pattern. In the case of
small 2 an increase in 2 leads to an improvement of the image, but with a con-
siderable increase in z the error increases due to the smoothing of image de-
tails with its great averaging. This circumstance is evidently one of the
reasons for the well-known fact of an improvement in the image of underwater
objects with an increase in observation height (to a definite level). Here the
radiation detector plays the role of a filter restoring the image. In the

case of very great heights the image quality again decreases. The effect of

an improvement in the image by an averaging detector is particularly conspic-
uous in the case of large I'- rf/;\ (the length of the surface wave is small
in comparison with the characteristgc scale of the object).

It follows from Fig. 3 that the optimum averaging value is essentially depend-
ent on the characteristics of the observed object and waves. This averaging is
particularly great with large R.

It can be shown that with z - 0 (that is, for detectors with an infinitely nar-

It shows by how many times the the square of the measurement error with use of
a detector with an optimum width of the directional diagram is less than this
some parameter with an infinitely narrow diagram. Figure 6 shows that this
gain increases with a decrease in the R parameter, that is, with a decrease

in the amplitude of the surface wave and the depth of the observed object and
an increase in the characteristic scale of this object.

Therefore. there is not always justification for the striving to use apparatus
with maximum spatial resolution for observing underwater features. The cited
results of computations make it possible to determine in what cases there is
assurance of a greater accuracy in measuring their luminosity distribution
when there is finite spatial averaging, to find the optimum value of this av-
eraging and to evaluate the accuracy gain occurring in this case.

[Text] 164th session of seninar -- 9 January 1981. Report by Candidate of Phys-
ical and Mathematical Sciences 6. H. Remit (Institute of Oceanology, USSR
Academy of Sciences) -- "Slightly Nonlinear Interactions of Rossby Haves."

The first part of the report gives the derivation of a kinetic equation describ-
ing the temporal evolution of the energy spectrum of slightly nonlinear waves
with random amplitudes. The method of many scales ("fast" time - the charac-
teristic time of change in wave phases, "slow" time -- the amplitude of waves
due to nonlinear interactions) was applied to an infinite series of equations
for cumulants. No restrictions are imposed on random wave fields other than
their spatial homogeneity. The conclusion presented here makes it possible to
avoid sane difficulties encountered in conclusions based on an analysis of the
equations for registered series (Benin and Safman (1966), Basselman (1962,
1967)), and it is substantially shorter than the latter.

The second part of the report discussed the results of investigation of slight-
ly nonlinear interactions of barotropic Rossby waves. 0n the basis of a Rim-tic
equation a study was made of the probl- of the dependence of the rate of energy
transfer in the spectrum (a P/d t) on the fare of the spectrum P(k, L , t),
where k, L are the wave numbers along the x, y axes and t is time. It was dem-
onstrated that if the spectrum is greatly "blurred" in azimuth, energy transfer
intensifies the zonal current component, which agrees with the results obtained
earlier by Cannon (1966) and Rice (1975). liowever. with an adequately strongly
expressed zonality of flow an intensive outflow of energy to the meridional
component begins and thus there is no degeneration into a zonal flow. Mother
effect is as follows. Assume that the initial spectrum is asymetrical. Then

it can be demonstrated that energy transfer decreases the asylmaetry and with
time the spectrun shouldtend to a sy-etric state. After attaining such a
state the spectrum rmins ayllnetric at all subsequent moments in time as well.

the Red Sea rift made it possible to express the hypothesis of the existence
of localized sources of thermal waters over which the fine structure of the
sea medium is formed (lbnin, et a1.. 1980). The global Rayleigh number Ra in
the latter case is much greater than in laboratory experiments. In this con-
nection laboratory experiments were carried out for a detailed study of the
structure of a convective current over a point heat source with different. in-
cluding large. quantities of conducted power P. The experimental method is de-
scribed. The experiments did not reveal any dependence of the nature of the
developing current on basin extent. A thermal heating element (THE) was also
used in order to exclude the influence of electrohydrodynamic instability.
This element consisted of a metallic cylinder with a height of 1 cm and a di-
ameter of 0.8 cm. within which a Nichrome spiral was placed.

These experiments made it possible to discriminate five characteristic regimes
of a convective current over a point heat source in a stratified medium. 1.
Diffusion regime. With small P. when Ra<450. a warm diffusion spot is formed
over the heater. The profiles of temperature. salinity and density remain
smooth. 2. Lateral structures. If Ra>Racr - 285-650. one (or several. depend-
ing on the height of the heater) convective cell is formed over the point heat
source or along the lateral surface. 3. Laminar-cellular convection. A fine
floating-up jet, surrounded by a bell-like "veil" of subsiding fluid, is formed
with 1000-2250< Ra< 20 000. Axially synetric cells with a height of 0.7-1.5
cm are formed around a salt dome. The number of cells increases with an in-
crease in the intensity of heating. lo. Finger-cellular convection. The flow in
the subsiding salt dome becomes unstable and disintegrates into salt fingers
when 20 000<Ra< 50 000. The region of finger convection is surrounded by a
system of eddy cells. 5. Intrusive regime. With Ra>50 000 the current in the
floating-up warm jet becomes unstable. Entrainment of the surrounding fluid
increases sharply and a spot of partially mixed fluid is formed above the heater
in which the temperature and salinity is greater than in the ambient medium.
The mixed fluid flows out in individual intrusive tongues. One or more cells
are formed over the mixing region.

In the regime of laminsr- and finger-cellular convection the height of the
structure increases with an increase in the power P0'5~(Ra)0-5. when Rs}
50 000 (intrusive regime) the height decreases with an increase in P. In all
convection regimes the current pattern is nonstationary and the position and

the number of layers change with the passage of time. The height of the cells is
slightly dependent on power: h~P°-1".

A study was also made of the current pattern over two heat sources situated
along one vertical or along one horizontal.

147th session of seminar -- 27 February 1981. Report of Professor B. A. Kngan
and V. A. Ryabchenko (Leningrad Division. Institute of Oceanolosy. USSR Acad-

in Ocean."

The report is devoted to a discussion of the problem of modeling the distribu-
tion and global budget of oxygen and carbon dioxide dissolved in sea water.

The basis for the proposed 2 1/2-dimensiona1 model of the distribution of dis-
solved oxygen is the similarity hypothesis for the vertical structure of the
oxygen field in each of the oceans. The turbulent diffusion equation, integrat-
ed vertically from the free surface to the bottom, with this hypothesis taken
into account, together with the expressions for the barotropic and baroclinic
components of horizontal velocity, the exprt sions parameterizing oxygen ex-
change between the ocean and atmosphere, oxygen production for photosynthesis
and biochemical consumption of oxygen, boundary and initial conditions, is used
in computing the mean annual distribution of the integral (vertically) concen-

tration and the components of the natural oxygen budget in the world ocean as
a whole and in individual oceans.

The results of numerical experiments show a qualitative agreement of the comput-
ed spatial distribution of integral concentration, the values of oxygen ex-
change between the ocean and the atmosphere and between individual oceans and
observational data. At the same time there is a strong dependence of the solu-
tion on the stipulation of biochemical "inputs" and "outputs" of oxygen in the
world ocean.

The carbon cycle is described within the framework of a simple and economically
advantageous box model of the ocean. In contrast to the traditional approach,
the thickness of the upper quasihomogeneous layer (Hot). water temperature and
exchange coefficients between the UQL and the deep layer (DL) of the ocean. as
well as the magnitude of the C02 flux at the water-air interface, are not reg-
istered, but are determined in the course of solution of the problem.

Two regions in the ocean are defined: a region of formation of cold deep waters
and the entire remaining part of the ocean, within which the entry of cold deep
waters from the regions of their sources is compensated by upwelling. In turn,
two layers -- the UQL and the DL -- are discriminated in the upwelling region.

The equations for temperature T1 and for the total carbon concentration C1 in

The latter makes it possible to reproduce the seasonal evolution of T1, 01, h,
C02 concentration, bicarbonate and carbonate ions and hydrogen ions, gas ex-
change with the atmosphere and exchange of heat and carbon between the UQL and
the DL of the ocean. As the initial information for determining the enumerated
characteristics use was made of data on the heat flow at the ocean surface,
partial pressure of C02 in the atmosphere. dynamic wind velocity, intensity of
the source of cold deep waters and on the ratio of the areas of the region of
upwelling and the region of formation of cold deep waters. '

The results of numerical experiments carried out for northern hemisphere ocean
waters indicate that the proposed model describes the principal qualitative
characteristics of the thermal regime and carbon cycle in the ocean. However.
the accuracy in their reproduction is determined to a considerable degree by
stipulation of the rate of upwelling. the mean annual surface heat flow. and
also "inputs" and "outputs" of carbon of organic origin.

148th session of seminar - 27th March 1981. Report of Candidate of Physical
and Mathematical Sciences V. P. Krssitskiy (Institute of Oceanology, USSR

Academy of Sciences) - "Two-Dimensional Cortewega-De Vries Equation for Grav-
itational-Capillary Haves."

The first part of the report, using one of the modifications of asymptotic meth-
ods. gives the derivation of the two-dimensional Cortewega-De Vries equation
(Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations) for tne case of gravitational-capillary

waves in shallow water. This equation is similar to the corresponding equation
for the case of purely gravitational waves, except that in the considered case
the dispersion parameter (coefficient on the dispersion term in the equation)
changes sign with a depth of the undisturbed water layer.of about 0.5 cm. Then
the speaker gave an analysis of the known solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviash-
vili equation in application to the case of gravitational-capillary waves.
Particular attention was devoted to an examination of the properties of two-
dimensional rational solitons which for the considered problem are stable for-
mations with a depth less than 0.5 cm (positive dispersion corresponding to a
negative dispersion parameter) and represent "depressions" with an insignificant
increase in the level of the undisturbed water at the edges of the depression.

A detailed study was made of the geometry of such solitons and numerical
evaluations are given showing the fundamental possibility of observing such
solitons under laboratory conditions.

149th session of seminar -- 3 April 1981. Report of Academician Ya. B. Zel'do-
vich and Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences A. A. Rumzaykin (Inst-
itute of Applied Mathematics, USSR Academy of Sciences), and Candidate of Phys-
ical and Mathematical Sciences D. D. Sokolov (Moscow State University) -- "Gen-
eration of Magnetic Fields in a Hell-Conducting Medium."

The magnetic field in a moving conducting medium. on the one hand, changes un-
der the influence of deformation of velocity, and on the other hand, is subject
to ohmic diffusion. The relative force of these effects is determined by the
magnetic Reynolds number Rm. with large Rm there can be an unlimited exponen-
tial growth or maintenence of the field (dynamo process). The Reynolds magnet-
ic number is quite great in the liquid cores of the planets (3-102 for the
earth, 2°10“ for Jupiter), convective envelopes of stars (for the sun ﬁnalos),
accretion disks in binary star systems (cvlo 0 , galactic and other cosmic bod-
ies. Accordingly, the dynaao theory problem is a clarification of the conditions
for generation of a magnetic field in an asymptotic regime Rm2>1. The authors
only touched on some results of the theory in a so-called kinematic approxima-
tion, that is, when the velocity field is considered stipulated.

A decisive role is played by current topology. If the fluid moves along a plane
or a spherical surface s dynamo is impossible (exclusion theorem). Only a tem-
porary increase in the field is possible; it is then replaced by asymptotic ut-
tenuation. With movement of a conducting fluid along stationary surfaces of a
more general type (such as a torus or a cylinder) there can be an exponential
increase in the magnetic field. However, it will be slow and the rate of field
increase in the long run becomes equal to zero when Rm-+<’°.

A rapid dynamo. for which the rate of field increase does not become equal to
zero when Rmocu, is possible for some three-dimensional currents. The simple
mechanism of such a dynamo is the simple folding of the field loop into a fig-
ure eight with subsequent doubling. A realistic example of a rapid dynamo is
a_dynamo in turbulence having average spiraling. Such turbulence naturally
arises in the cores of planets and the convective envelopes of stars due to
rotation and density stratification of the fluid. A rapid dynamo, operating

due to spiraling of turbulence and nonuniform rotation, is the principal mech-
anism of the solar (stellar) activity cycle.

Another example of a rapid dynamo is the generation of microscale magnetic
fields in turbulence, on the average mirror-symmetric. Field excitation is
already possible with relatively small Rm (;560) and with a Prandtl magnetic
number less than unity. The latter condition is not satisfied in the cores of
planets.

Recently many new results have been obtained in nonlinear dynamo theory. with
allowance for the inverse influence of the magnetic field on motion. The non-
linear dynamo makes it possible to explain complex global stochastic regimes
in the behavior of the magnetic field. One of these phenomena is random re-
versals of the earth's magnetic field and another is global minima of solar
activity of the well-known Maunder minimum type.

150th session of seminar -- 15 May 1981. Report of Corresponding Member USSR
Academy of Sciences G. S. Golitsyn (Institute of Atmospheric Physics. USSR
Academy of Sciences) -- "Investigation of Convection of a Rapidly Rotating
Fluid."

The first part of the report gave the derivation of a formula for the mean
velocities of convective movements of a quite rapidly rotating fluid with ap-
plication of the concepts of similarity and dimensionality. using some self-
similarity hypotheses, on the assumption of nonessentiality of the precise
values of the molecular coefficients of transfer and depth of the fluid.
Simple experiments with convection in carbonated mineral water and in water
cooling from the surface indicated a satisfactory coincidence between the
measured and predicted velocities and made it possible to estimate the numer-
ical value of the coefficients in theoretical formulas. However. observations
of the propagation of a tracer in a rotating fluid show that this propagation
occurs in thin layers or tongues where the effects of viscosity must be sub-
stantial.

The assumption that these layers are internal boundary layers of the Ekman
type and an analysis of the balance of dissipation of the kinetic energy of
movements solve the paradox which arises, aggravated further by the exclusion
of vertical movements in an ideal fluid by the Proudman-Taylor theorem. A de-
tailed analysis of the balance of dissipation in the entire volume of the
rotating fluid shows that movements with the estimated velocities occupy only
a small fraction of the total volume. Rough estimates show that this fraction
can fall in the range 0.1-0.01.

This was followed by a discussion of the laws of heat or mass transfer during
convection of a rotating fluid on the basis of laboratory measurements by

H. T. Rossby. A qualitative explanation is given for the lag in development of
convection. the decrease in the Nuaselt number (rate of heat transfer) with an
increase in the velocity of rotation. Use was made of the known analogies be-
tween currents of rotating and stratified fluid (in the latter there is also

a stratification of movements).

In conclusion there was a discussion of the application of the results to an
estimate of the rates of convection in the giant planets. having-internal
heat sources, and to the earth's liquid core. The rates of movements in the
core are estimated at several kilometers annually, which in order of magni-
tude coincides with the velocities of drift of nondipole geomagnetic field
components. The resulting observed structure of currents can explain the geo-
magnetic dynamo. Por the ocean. as in the case of the sun, the role played by
rotation in formation of the structure of convection is small in the sense
that the effects studied here should usually still not be manifested.

lSlst session of seminar -- 12 June 1981. Report of Professor V. Ye. Zakh-
arov (Institute of Theoretical Physics imeni Landau, USSR Academy of Sci-
ences) and Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences M. H. Zaslavskiy
(Institute of Oceanology, USSR Academy of Sciences) -- "Theory of Hind Waves
in the Approximation of Heak Turbulence."

0n the basis of experimental data on the closeness of the energy-carrying
components of sufficiently well-developed waves to linear free waves, for
their description use is made of the kinetic equation of the "weak turbulence"
approximation, taking into account nonlinear interactions, pumping from the
wind and dissipation. It is shown that with the natural assumption of local-
ization of pumping and dissipation in a microscale region there is a signif-
icant physical simplification of the general kinetic equation for wind waves
related to the circumstance that the 8(40) spectrum of adequately developed
waves in the energy-carrying region is determined only by the integral char-
acteristics of interaction of waves with the wind and drift currents. In

this case 8(0)) is determinas by 7 dimensional analysis of the kinetic equation:
5(aJ) a 2ap1/3°34/3“J’11/3' S( a! ,where a is a dimensionless coefficient

dependent on the angular distribution of energy; p is the integral flux of the
wave effect into the long-wave region; 6 S is the "blurred" Heaviside function,
forming the spectrum at the frequency of the spectral maximum aim. The deriv-
ed expression for 5(a)) is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental
data.

On the basis of the initial equation in a general horizontally inhomogeneous
and nonstationary case an equation is then derived for the correlation of the
parameters “’m and p of the derived expression for S(cd), which is reduced to

152d session of seminar -- 19 June 1981. Report of Candidate of Physical and
Mathematical Sciences V. D. Larichev (Institute of Oceanology. USSR Academy
of Sciences) -- "Nonlinear Dynamics on the [B-Plane and Solitary Waves.

The general tendencies in the nonlinear evolution of disturbance on thelﬂ-
plane (barotropic problem) localised in space were examined. It was demon-
strated that in the nonlinear problem, due to the conservation of potential
vorticity, there will be a restriction on the wave radiation at infinity and
therefore situations are possible when in an unlimited region the amplitude
of the localized disturbance does not decrease to zero with time (in contrast
to the linear problem). The author gave an analysis of several such situations
differing with respect to the geometry of the boundaries and the structure of
the current. Applications to Gulf Stream rings are given. 0n the basis of
these considerations the paper gives a comparison of two-dimensional antisym-
metric Rossby solitary waves which indicates a greater stability of the waves
moving to the west than to the east.

The concept of a closed potential vorticity isoline is introduced; this deter—
mines the behavior of the amplitude of the disturbance over greater times. The
presence of closed isolines means a conservation of a nonlinear regime at all
times, which gives a cessation of the spectral energy flux. The conservability
of closed potential vorticity isolines leads to the appearance of a "memory"
in the system and as a result, the absence of universal spectra. Two "anti-
soliton theorems" are formulated: the first gives the necessary condition for
the initial vorticity field in which two-dimensional solitary Rossby waves do
not appear with the passage of time: the second shows that antisymmetric soli-
tary waves do n0t survive collisions. The role of two-dimensional Rossby soli-
tary waves in the dynamics of the ocean is discussed.

[Text] In 1978 the Institute organized the First Polar Northeastern Expedition
(PPNEB) for the purpose of studying relief. geological structures and sediments
on the shelf of the Chukchi and Bering Seas (expedition chief Yu. A. Pavlidis).
This expedition planned the inpleaentation of its work in collaboration with
the Geography Faculty of Moscow State University and the Provideniya hydrolog-
ical base. The institute regards work on the Arctic shelf to be highly impor—
tant, especially when carrying out leading_geologicsl-geonorphological inves-
tigations.

In 1978 the FPNEB, aboard the ship "Dmitriy Laptev" of the Provideniya hydro-
logical base, carried out a couple: of studies, including geophysical invest—
igations on the shelf, by the continuous seisnic profiling nethod, drilling of
the stratum of sedinents with a vibrating piston corer, echo sounding neasure-
acute and on-shore geological-geoaorphological investigations [1].

In 1980 expeditionary work was carried out in this sane region, first on the
ship "Vega," and later on the ship "Buitriy Lsptev" (expedition,chief Yu. I.
Vozovik). The work progran provided for the carrying out of further geological-
geomorphological investigations, including for-ing of a denser grid of sea runs
and stations with the taking of bottom sanples and also underwater photograph-
ing of the surfaces of characteristic hottoa relief elements. Particular atten-
tion was devoted to the study of relief and hotton sediments of the fiord bays
of southeastern Chukotka in connection with the problem of their origin, and
also for solving the prohlen of the nature of Late Pleistocene glaciation.
leaving its traces in the for. of relict glacial relief in the coastal-shelf
zone.

The ship "Dnitriy Laptev" was used in running the following extended geological
profiles with the taking of botton samples: along the entire Bering Sea shelf
from its southern edge in the neighborhood of Cape Navarin to Bering Strait and
then to Cape Golovnin (Hope) in Alaska, in the chukchi Sea -- a suhneridional
profile to Kolyuchinskaya Bay with studies in the latter and the profile

wrungel lsland-—Bering Strait. During the expeditionary period a total of 1800
miles of geological profiles were run. 700 miles of echo soundings were run.
122 geological stations were occupied with the taking of cores with an impact
corer and with taking of dredged samples, and samples of the surface layer of

battom sediments were fixed. Underwater photography of the bottom was taken at
57 stations.

In 1981 expeditionary investigations on the shelf of seas in the Northeastern
USSR. on the one hand, were finalized (in the Chukchi Sea and in the northern
part of the Bering Sea), and on the other hand represented the first attempt
of institute specialists to carry out reconnaissance geological-geomorpholog-
ical and lithological work in the East Siberian and Laptev Seas. In the Chukchi
and Bering Seas the plan called for carrying out additional geological explor-
ation along lines of long-planned sea runs not executed in preceding years in
connection with ice conditions or stormy weather. A new type of investigation
was lithodynamic studies, specifically the use of bathometers to take water
samples from different horizons for determining the quantity of suspended
matter and its mineralogical composition in the water layer of these seas.
This is necessary for clarifying the problem of the nature of transport of
suspended matter from the Bering Sea to the Chukchi Sea and the role of solid
runoff of the Yukon River and other rivers in the processes of morphololitho-
genesis in the southeastern part of the Chukchi Sea.

In order to carry out research work for FREE-81 (expedition chief A. S. Ioniu)
the Provideniya hydrological base was given the ship "Dmitriy Laptev" and the
icebreaker "Georgiy Sedov." The ship "Dmitriy Laptev" (detachment heads V. S.
Hedvedev and Yu. A. Pavlidis) was used in carrying out geological runs with the
taking of cores. dredged samples and suspended matter in the following direc-
tions: Lavrentiya Gulf-Cape Douglas (Alaska), Bering Strait - Cape Golovnin
(Alaska). Cape Golovnin - Cape Serdtse Kamen' (Chukotka), Vankar' village -
Wrangel Island, Hrangel Island - Herald Bank, Cape Chukotskiy - mouth of the
Yukon Rivet. Geological sections were accompanied by echo sounding measure-
ments. The icebreaker "Georgiy Sedov” (detachment heads Yu. I. Vozovik and .. V.
Kalinenko) carried out the following sections: Long Strait - Chaunskaya Bay.
Ayon Island - Bear Islands, Bear Islands - Strait Dmitriy Laptev - Tiksi Bay.
The detachments carried out much geological-geomorphological work in polygons
in the neighborhood of the Bear Islands.

In all, during the expeditionary period, somewhat shortened as a result of the
severe ice conditions. the detachments carried out: 17 geological runs with a
total extent of about 1600 miles, echo sounding runs of 1800 miles and 102 geo-
logical stations. During the time of work 135 dredged boctom samples were tak-
en, as well as 181 samples of water from different horizons and 63 bottom cores.

In the course of the work material was collected on geological structures, the
characteristics of relief structure and the lithology of the sedimentary strata
of the northeastern shelf of the USSR. Investigations were made of the distrib-
ution and composition of the suspended matter, making possible a deeper compre-
hension of the mechanism of polar morpholithogenesia and a determination of the
rate of sedimentation processes.

In general it should be noted that as a result of the three Polar Northeastern
Expeditions of the Institute it use possible to determine the principal charac-
teristics of the structure of the upper stratum of bedrocks on the shelf, pri-
marily the Chukchi Sea, ascertain its principal morphostructural elements and
prepare a general map of the latest vertical movements of these structures.
Lithological investigations made it possible to characterize sedimentation con-
ditions in the Chukchi Sea. determine the balance of sedimentary material and
ascertain the facies-lithological zones on the shelf. Hicropaleontological
investigations of bottom cores made possible a stratigraphic breakdown of H010-
cene shelf deposits. The collected materials to a considerable degree broaden-
ed existing concepts concerning the Late Pleistocene history of development

of the shelf zone of the Chukchi-Bering region. The collected materials served
as a basis for developing a theory of morpholithogenesis on the shelves of the
world ocean and in particular, made it possible to ascertain the characteris-
tics of polar morpholithogenesis on the shelf of the Northeastern USSR.

EFFECT ON MEASUREMENTS OF CURRENT PARAMETERS

[Text] Abstract: A recorder of fluctuations of
relative current velocity and angular
deviations relative to the longitudinal.
transverse and vertical axes of a current
meter is described. Methods for the stat-
istical processing of data for the purpose
of determining the contribution of differ-
ent components to the total dispersion of
the error in measuring current velocity
are analyzed. Also discussed are the results
of measurements made in the Caribbean Sea
at different depths.

Among the principal factors determining the errors in measuring the parameters
of oceanic currents at self-contained buoy stations are the characteristic
motions of current meters. These motions consist of the angular movements of

the body of the automatic recorder relative to the suspension point, horizontal
and vertical oscillations of the suspension point, slow movements of the line
relative to the anchor. The main disturbances responsible for these movements
are surface waves. periodic and aperiodic currents at different depths. elastic-
ity forces in the line and its changing geometry and torsional oscillations

of the supporting line under the influence of changing tension.

The motion of the supporting buoy at a buoy station and the slow oscillations
of the line associated with it were investigated by Rebaynis [7] using naviga-

tional methods. These investigations revealed the most characteristic periods of
oscillations: 1.5, 3.2, 6 and 12 hours with velocities frwm 2 to 30 cm-sec‘l.

At the present time extremely little study has been made of the more high-fre-
quency oscillations. primarily by means of a motion picture survey of the be-
havior of the instruments at shallow-water buoy stations [1] and by means of

modeling of the effect of currents and waves on the body of the instrument in
a hydrodynamic basin [2]. The results of these investigations indicated that

oscillations of the current meters have a substantial effect on the observa-

tion results.

Oscillations of current recorders at buoy stations are considerably more com-
plex than can be modeled in a basin or registered by a motion picture survey
in the case of shallow water near a pile base. In order to evaluate the real
errors in measuring currents under different conditions there must be investi-
gations of characteristic movaents under in situ conditions.

In order to solve this problem, on the proposal of V. c. Kort, corresponding
member. Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, specialists at the Marine Hydrophysical
Institute, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, created a special apparatus and
method for the processing of data and carried out the first measurements dur-
ing the 38th voyage of the scientific research ship "Mikhail Lomonosov" in the
Caribbean Sea. This article gives the results of these investigations.

The DISK-H self-contained recording instrument was incorporated in the body of
the DISK current recorder [6, 9]. The placement of individual units in the in—
strument is shown in Fig. 1. The programing unit 6 of the DISK-M cuts the
measurement system and the recorder into the power circuit at a stipulated
time (~ 10 hours) after triggering of the clockmechanisn. The measurements
are made with a discreteness of 0.8 sec over the course of 1.5 hour. Fluctua-
tions of the relative flow velocity are measured by an impeller 3 'aunted on
the upper cover of the instrument. The position of the axis of the impeller
relative to the plane of the magnetic meridian is measured by a magnetic com...
pass 9 held in a Cardan joint. The measuring transducer of this compass en-
sures continuous readings with an absolute error of 3'. The instrument also
registers oscillations of two pendulums 4 whose axes are registered relative
to the body parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the impeller.

The registry of all four parameters in the form of a binary code is accomplish-
ed using a standard miniaturized magnetic recorder cassette 7. The reproduction
of the recorded information is by use of a cassette magnetic recorder‘thrnugh a
special reproduction unit directly in the electronic computer operational mem-
cry.

The impeller of the DISK-H measurement apparatus has four blades with a radial-
ly variable pitch, at the bottom resting on supports. The diameter of the screw
is 133 m, the geometric pitch of the impeller is 255 mm, the start—up thresh-
old is 0.S-l cm-sec‘l, reading is contactless, by means of 12 small magnets em-
bedded in a rim. Specially formulated investigations revealed that the impeller
synchronization path is 16-18 cm. The equivalent time constant is equal to the
ratio of the synchronization path to the current velocity and for typical meas-
urement conditions in the ocean does not exceed 1-1.5 sec.

The pendulums are SOO-gram weights attached eccentrically on the axes of pre-
cision wire potentiometers and placed in oil. The nominal period of the atten-
uating oscillations of the pendulums is 0.1; see, the attenuation time of the
oscillations ist sec. The mean square error in measuring deflections of the
pendulums is 0.36 degree.

For an analysis of the interrelationship between the readings of the pendulums
and the horizontal rate of movements of the instrument, which is registered by
the impeller, we will use the known equations of motion of the pendulum

in the presence of a forcing force [6. 8]. In a linear approximation and on the
assumption that the vertical accelerations are considerably less than the ac-
celeration of gravity. the equation for fluctuations of theﬂ angle of pen-
dulum deflection relative to the body of the instrument and the horizontal
velocity V of instrument movement can be written in the following form:

K.v-3+2eo.p+o:jﬂ(n)dm (1)

where 5 is the relative attenuation coefficient; U is the frequency of the
natural nonattenuating pendulum oscillations: - mill is a constant coef-
ficient in which n is pendulun mass; 1, is the d stance between the pendulum
center of gravity and the axis of rotation; I is the moment of inertia.

The resultant fluctuations of velocity V are represented in the form of the s:-
of the three components V1, V2, V3, corresponding to the contribution to the

total novenents of the three terns on the right-hand side of equation (1), and
we will compute their dispersions 0'12, 1722 and 0'32.

In processing real records of current velocity fluctuations and fluctuations
of the angle of deflections of the pendulums we use the cospectra of these
:alues for computing €722 (the components V1 and V3 make no contribution to
the cospectrum values), whereas for computing 0'12 and 0'32 we use the quad-
rature spectra and the phase characteristic. The latter makes it possible to
evaluate the contribution of V1 and V3 to the values of the total quadrature
spectrum since the component of the V1 fluctuations outpaces the‘ﬂ fluctua-
tions by 90°, whereas the V3 component lags behind them by the same value.

Thus. having synchronous measurements of fluctuations of current velocity and
the angles of deflection for the pendulums, as well as the results of their
cross-statistical processing, it is possible to compute the dispersions of

the natural oscillations of the current velocity measurement transducer in dif-
ferent ranges of periods of fluctuations and to evaluate their contribution

to the total dispersion of the registered fluctuations of ocean current velo-
city.

Investigations of natural oscillations of the self-contained current recorders
were made in the Caribbean Sea at two buoy stations with a surface buoy of the
GH-Sl type. At buoy station 1 the depth of placement of the DISK-H instrument'
was 30 m, wind velocity was 10.5 m-sec'l, sea waves were class a, and the wave
period was 6-8 sec where the ocean depth was 2230 m. At buoy station 2 the
measurements were made at a depth of 175 m with a wind velocity of 6 m-sec‘1

and waves of class 2; the wave period was Z-b sec and the ocean depth was
2220 m.

1. The number of degrees of freedom of evaluations of the spectra was 26; the
range of their selective variability with a probability 0.8 is shown in Fig.
3. This same figure shows the quadrature spectra S_v and S_v and also the
cospectra S+v3 and S+v}'of these same fluctuations and shows the regions of
selective variability of these evaluations with the probability 0.8 [3].

In the spectrum of velocity fluctuations there are two distinct maxima: the
first in the range of fluctuation periods 20-30 sec. the second in the range
of periods 6-8 sec. The quadrature spectra S.vp and s_v,r each have two laxi-
ua at these same frequencies; the S-vg values are positive and the s_v,zval-

ues are negative. The S+VB cospectrun has a small positive maximum in the
region of 6-second fluctuation periods.

Figure 4 shows the spectra of fluctuations of current velocity SV and the angle
of instrument yawing an. on the basis of data from measurements with a magnetic
compass at buoy station 1. This same figure shows the quadrature spectrum of
fluctuations of velocity and the yawing angle and cospectrum of these values.
The Sq, spectrum has one clearly expressed maximum in the range of periods of
fluctuations 20-30 sec; the cospectrum Sqﬂwglnd the quadrature spectrum S-vu¢
have maxima for these same periods of fluctuations.

The noted maxima Sv and Sap for periods 20-30 sec correspond to amplitudes for
yawing 12-14° and a relative current velocity of 1.5 cm°sec'1. An analysis of
the variability of the vector of relative velocity for such fluctuations is
evidence that their possible cause may be vibrational motions of the supports
relative to the line and the drift movements of the line itself with an an li-
tude of oscillations 60-50 cm and a drift velocity of the line 1-2 cm-sec' .

Oscillations with periods of 6-8 sec, where the principal characteristics of
the spectra are manifested, coincide in frequency with the wind waves. Insig-
nificant S+v‘_and S-v¢,va1ues in this frequency range, instability of the phase
shift and the insignificant coherence indicate that at the frequency of the
wind waves the fluctuations of relative velocity and the yawing angle are stat-
istically independent.

The period of natural oscillations of the DISK-H instrument container is 2-3
see. In the velocity spectrum in this frequency range there are no maxima
and the spectra of fluctuations of the )3 and‘Y'angles contain small maxima.

For an analysis of the contribution of the registered oscillations to the total
dispersion of errors in current velocity. in accordance with the analytical
method presented above. the investigated frequency range was broken down into
three parts corresponding to the mentioned features of the spectral character-
istics. The first frequency range takes in the periods of oscillations 80-14
sec, corresponding to oscillations of the supports with instruments relative to
the line: the second frequency range corresponds to periods of 16-3 sec of wind
waves and swell waves; the third frequency range corresponds to periods of 3-
1.9 sec of characteristic oscillations of the instrument container relative to
the suspension point.

The computed dispersion of velocity fluctuations 012, (722 and (752 for the
ﬁend Yangles, computed using expressions (6)-(8). are given in a table.

The actual dispersion of the velocity fluctuations was determined by integra-
tion of the Sv spectrum in a stipulated frequency range and for the entire
investigated frequency range it is approximately 2 times greater than the
value computed using expressions (6)-(8). This shows that the possible con-
tribution of oscillations of current recorders to the registered oscilla-
tions in the investigated frequency range is approximately half the total en-
ergy of the fluctuations of current velocity.

The results of the computations in the table also indicate that the greatest
contribution to the total dispersion is from oscillations with the frequencies
of wind waves and swell waves (79%), then oscillations with a period of tens
of seconds (202) and an insignificant contribution (<ilZ) is from oscilla-
tions with periods characteristic for the frequency of the natural oscilla-
tions of the instrument housing. Oscillations in the longitudinal plane of
the current meter ( ﬂ angle) introduce a 15-201 greater contribution to the
total dispersion of oscillations of instrument velocity in comparison with
oscillations in the transverse plane ( 7’angle). The mean square value of
velocity fluctuations caused by instrument oscillations in the investigated
frequency range is 3.12 cm-sec'l, which for the measurement conditions is
somewhat greater than 71 of the mean hourly current velocity.

The spectra of velocity fluctuations Sv, the angles of deflection of the pen-
dulums Sp, s-y. yawing Sq, and also the quadrature spectra and cospectra

of these parameters obtained at buoy station 2 at a depth of 175 m in general
are similar to the curves shown in Pig. 3 and differ for the most part with
respect to lesser values along the y-axis. The spectra of velocity and the
angle ﬂ of pendulum deflection in the longitudinal plane of the current meter
and the quadrature spectrum of these parameters have clearly expressed maxima
in the region of periods of oscillations 10-30 sec and relatively small max-
im in the region of periods of oscillations 3.5-5 sec. The corresponding co-
spectrum 8+ p has a maximum peak in the region of periods 4-5 sec and a less-
er mmximum or periods of 10 sec. The spectra of angles of deflections in

the transverse 5,; plane In close to "white noise." values of the mean square
fluctuations of velocity and angles of deflections of the pendulums register-
ed at a depth of 175 m were equal to 0", I 0.83 cm-sec'l, 053 - 0.72° and
Cﬁr- 0.35'. These values are close to the instrumental measurement errors,
which makes a more detailed analysis for this case infeasible.

We note in conclusion that the method for investigating oscillations of the
current meters and their influence on the errors in measuring current para-
meters, based on direct measurements of fluctuations of the relative velocity
of currents and angles of deflection relative to the longitudinal, transverse
and vertical axes of the current meter makes it possible to study the para-
meters of such fluctuations for the entire diversity of conditions for the
measurement of currents under real conditions (depth of placement of instru-
ment and depth of ocean, state of sea surface, type of buoy installation and
its parameters, design of current recorder, method for its suspension, etc.).

Already the first measurements described in tuis article indicated that the
parameters of oscillations of the current recorders can differ significantly
from one another depending on the depth of measurement and the state of the
sea surface. For example, the standard deviation of the velocity fluctuations
caused by instrument oscillations at a depth of 30 m was approximately four
times greater than the similar value at a depth of 175 m.

Direct measurements of fluctuations of velocity and the angles of deflection
made it possible to detect a number of new characteristics of the behavior

of instruments and to evaluate their contribution to the general dispersion of
error. These characteristics include the angular oscillations of the instru-
ments in the horizontal plane relative to the line with characteristic am-
plitudes of 60-50 cm and periods of 20-30 sec, a predominant contribution of
oscillations with the periods of wind waves in the upper horizons, and an in-
significant contribution of instrument oscillations relative to the suspen-
sion point to the total energy of the oscillations.

Further investigations of oscillations of current meters will make it possible,
first of all, to obtain statistical data on the measurement errors under dif-
ferent conditions. and second, to find the most rational designs of measuring
instruments, buoy apparatus and suspension of the current meters, to evaluate
the influence of different types of sensing elements and measurement conver-
ters on measurement accuracy.

[Text] Abstract: The author proposes a new method
for seismic profiling in the ocean with the
use of a towed radio buoy and a pneumatic
sound source. The distance between the sound
source and the radio buoy is selected in
such a way as to ensure the optimum condi-
tions fbr the tracing of reflecting boun-
daries (registry of waves reflected in the
region of critical angles). In individual
reference segments of the profile it is
possible to obtain long travel-time curves
of reflected waves necessary for determining
the velocity parameters of the medium. The
article gives the results of testing of the
method in the Atlantic Ocean on the 24th
voyage of the scientific research ship
"Akademik Kurchatov."

One of the promising directions in seismic investigations in the ocean is the
introduction of long multichannel receiving systems making possible use of the
common deep point (CDP) method. The CDP method in work on the land and in shal-
low sea regions makes possible a more reliable discrimination and tracing of
deep seismic boundaries and a determination of the velocity characteristic of
the section. However. its use in abyssal regions of the ocean. although it has
unquestionable advantages over the standard continuous seismic profiling (03?)
method. nevertheless is inadequately effective due to the small ratio of the
measurement base to the depth of the reflecting boundaries. If the problem is
a study of the entire earth's crust in the ocean. for the reliable discrimina-
tion of deep discontinuities and correct determinations of mean and stratum
velocities it is necessary to ensure at least an equality of the total thick-
ness of the water and crust to the measurement base, that is, 10-12 km.

1hu length of the multichannel receiving systems in seismic reconnaissance

by the CDP method in the son and in work similar to thln hv ihv dvvp nrlnmlr
sounding-reflecred waves method in the ocean [2] is usually 1.5-3.0 km. which
does not meet the indicated requirements. This difficulty can be overcome when
working from two ships, which makes it possible to eliminate the source of
seismic oscillations at the necessary distance from the receiving system. Such
experiments were carried out in 1962 in the Black Sea, where travel-time curves
of reflected waves with a length up to 10 km were obtained [1]. In 1976 the
seismic profiling method from two ships was used with a 20-km distance between a
source and receiving system in successful tests on an American expedition in
the Pacific Ocean [5]. However. the organization of synchronous investigations
from two ships is not always possible and is technically complex.

0n the basis of the work experience of the Institute of Oceanology, USSR Acad-

emy of Sciences with a seismic buoy of the Lunarskiy design [3] and lowering of
bottom seismographs on a Kapron line on the 26th voyage of the scientific re—

search vessel "Akademik Kurchatov" (1977) it was possible to test a new seis-
mic profiling method along long bases with the transmission of seismic signals
through a radio channel. Such seismic profiling. using the terminology of Amer-
ican scientists. can be called wide-angle reflection.

Physical basis of method. The idea of the method is as follows. The ship moves
along the profile with a constant velocity and tows a pneumatic sound source

(PSS) which is activated at equal time intervals, such as each minute. A radio
buoy which is adapted for towing is lowered from the ship's stern on a Kapron line
(or still better, propylene) line. The radio buoy signals. after demodulation

and filtering, are registered with a RDD—RUH-type aprtratus (from the "Gorizont"
seismoprofilograph outfit), which is triggered by the same quartz clock.

In the first stage of the work the Kapron line is let out at a rate equal to
the ship's speed, which ensures obtaining a travel-time curve of seismic waves
with a fixed reception point and the source at an increasing distance from it.
Using this travel-time curve it is possible to determine the mean and stratum
velocities and the depth of the reflecting boundaries by the use of known meth-
ods. The maximum distance between the Pss and the radio buoy is selected with
allowance for the objectives of the experiment and seismogeological conditions
and can attain 5-10 km or more. The best conditions for the registry of re-
flected waves from a studied discontinuity, as is well known. will be at
"critical" distances (Rcr)o that is, with reflection of waves from a discon-
tinuity in the region of critical angles.

In the second work stage the letting-out of the Kapron line stops and the radio
buoy is towed behind the ship at a stipulated distance 43 R, which is the best
for obtaining reflected waves from one or more of the most important discontin-
uities. This ensures continuous tracing of the reflecting boundaries along the

profile, with use of quasicritical reflected waves most favorable for the study
of deep discontinuities.

In the third stage of the work the Kapron line is drawn in by the winch at a
rate equal to the ship's speed and the radio buoy gradually approaches the
PSS. This ensures obtaining a travel-time curve of seismic waves as in the
first stage of the work, but already at a different point on the profile.

vesvript ion of experiment. Experimental work for testing of the proposed method
was carried out in the Canaries Basin of the Atlantic Ocean in a sector with an
chn bottom. Due to the nonadaptahility of the existing radio buoy to towing
while the ship was proceeding on course the work was done while the ship was

at drlft (the rate of drift under the influence of the wind was about 1.5 knot),
which simulated towing at a slow rate. The ship was oriented with the starboard
to the wind. The radio buoy was let out on a Kapron line by means of an LK winch.
The depth of the radio buoy hydrophone was 40 m.

The pneumatic sound source with a volume 2 x 3 liters operated at a depth of

200 m with an interval of 1 minute. The PSS was triggered by a shipboard quartz
clock.

The radio buoy signals were received with a whip antenna mounted on the ship's
mast. were fed to an R1050 radio station and then to a reconversion unit where
they were demodulated and filtered. The signals were fed from the filter output
(frequency band 10—50 Hz) to an non-nun apparatus where they were registered
on electrochemical paper and on a magnetic recorder. At the sane time seismo-
grams were registered on an N—327/5.

The figure shows an example of the record obtained with the BBB. 0n the record
it is possible to discriminate three segments corresponding to the three stages
of the work described in the preceding section. In the first stage a Kapgon
line was let out until the radio buoy was 5 km from the ship. A travel-time
curve of waves reflected from the bottom surface and from the underlying re-
flecting discontinuities (to depths of 1.5-2 km below the bottom) was obtained.
It can be seen that with an increase in the distance from the source the cor-
relation of some bottom reflections ceases. but the most stable deep waves are
retained. The interpretation of this travel-tine curve made it possible to re~
fine the velocity model of the sedimentary layer of the Canaries Basin [4].

In the second stage the letting-out of the Kapron line ended and the radio buoy
drifted (was towed) behind the ship at a constant distance. In the correspond-
ing segment of the record, despite the increasing noise background, horizontal
discontinuities are easily traced in the upper part of the section, as well as
the boundaries of the lower structural stage, having a complex relief.

In the third stage of the work the Kapron line was drawn onto the LK winch,
drawing the radio buoy tr the ship. The noise background in this case increas-
ed greatly and the discrimination of the reflected waves deteriorated.

In order to reduce the noise background during the towing of the radio buoy its
standard hydrophone was replaced by a SOhm section of a hose oil-filled line

of seismic detectors from the continuous seismic profiling system. Thereafter,
the entire work cycle with the radio buoy was repeated, but the duration of
each cycle had to be reduced due to an inadequacy of time. The use of a section
of the string of seismic detectors was extremely effective in the second stage
of the work - during the towing of the radio buoy behind the ship at drift

at a speed of about 1.5 knot. However. with pulling-in of the radio buoy with
the winch in the third stage there was a marked deterioration of audibility of
radio buoy radio signals. This evidently occurred due to the radio buoy losing
its vertical position and the antenna touching the water surface (the ocean
waves during the time of the experiment attained 5-6 units). In general. the
use of a section of a string of seismic detectors gave encouraging results.

The experiments carried out on the 26th voyage of the sci.ntific research ship
"Akademik Kurchatov" with wide-angle seismic profiling in the ocean with a radio
buoy and a pneumatic sound source confirmed the effectiveness and practical pos-
sibility of such studies. In the further use of the method on expeditions it is

necessary to change the design of the radio buoy, adapting it for towing at a
speed up to 5-6 knots. As indicated by experiments, in order to decrease noise
during the towing of the radio buoy instead of a single hydrophone it is desir-
able to use a group detector - a section of a line of seismic detectors.

MEASUREMENTS OP VOLUME SOUND SCATTERING IN OCEAN USING ABYSSAL ACOUSTIC
SYSTEM

[Text] Abstract: A study of volume sound scattering
in the central Atlantic by means of an abys-
sal acoustic system indicated that the sound-
scattering layer, observed at depths of 500-
600 m. was formed by individual "targets,"
evidently constituting shoals of fish. The
volume sound scattering coefficient within
a "target" can exceed by two orders of magni-
tude the volume scattering coefficient for
the particular layer.

During the 31st voyage of the scientific research ship "Akademik Kurchatov"
specialists carried out measurements of volune sound scattering in the ocean
using an abyssal acoustic system (AAS). constituting a deep-water sealed con—
tainer lowered over the ship's side. This container contains emitting and re-
ceiving channels. An emitter (pieaoceramic ring) and a receiver (piezoceramic
sphere) are attached to the container. An oscillograph and a digital magnetic
recorder are used as tecorders. The duty cycle of the tonal-pulsed signal was
5 KHz; pulse duration was 2, b and 8 msec; pulse repetition rate was 1 sec.

Figures 1 and 2 show the results of aeasurements of the intensity of volume
sound scattering 10 lg mv obtained in the central part of the Atlantic Ocean
during the daytime on 16 July 1980. The volume scattering coefficient mv was
determined (see [1]) as the ratio of the power w scattered by the volume V in
a unit solid angle in a backward direction to the intensity I of an acoustic
wave incident on the scattering volume: mv - w/IV.

It can be seen from Fig. 1, which shows the vertical profile of the intensity
of volume scattering, that the sound-scattering layer (SSL) was at a depth of
500-600 a; the averaged values of the intensity of volume scattering in this

layer (about -70 db relative to l m'l) are typical for the similar layer in

the Atlantic at a frequency' of 5 K32. At other horizons there was only ambient
noise whose level corresponded to the intensity of scattering -8l.6 db. The
measurements were made each 50 m vertically to the bottom, situated at a depth
of 2600 m; the horizons below 1500 m are not indicated in Fig. 1. As an illus-
tration, the right-hand side of Pig. 1 gives a fragment of an echo sounder
record obtained using a shipboard echo sounder operating at a frequency of

10 KHz in a region close to the point where the measurements were made. There
is a good correspondence between sounding data from the abyssal acoustic system
and echo sounder measurements. .

The frequency of the mv(z) curve must be considered high. The cited profile
was measured twice: during the lowering of the measurement system and during
its raising. At all depths there were no appreciable deviations of the mv val-
ues obtained during lowering from the values obtained during raising.

The employed method makes it possible to determine the nature and position of
both the upper and lower boundary of the sound-scattering layer, something
which cannot be done with widely used remote acoustic methods. This fact affords
the possibility, in the case of repeated successive measured mv(a) profiles. to
determine small-scale spatial-temporal variability of both horizontal boundar-

ies and the structure of the sound-scattering layer.

Since the measurement of sound scattering with this system was carried out in
s small volume. it was possible to observe interesting local patterns of scat-

(or distance r from the emission-reception point) at successive (each 10 sec-
ands) moments in time. Each curve in Fig. 2 represents the dependence 10 1g
mv(t) (or 10 1g mv(r)) averaged for five pulses. From pulse to pulse there
were considerably greater fluctuations in the intensity of volume scattering
than indicated on the averaged curves in Fig. 2, caused by the change in the
phase relationships of echo signals from individual scatterers.

It was found that this sound-scattering layer was not formed by uniformly dis—
tributed scatterers but by individual "targets." evidently constituting schools
of small fish. One of these "targets." moving near the acoustic system, is also
seen in the form of a maximum of the intensity of volume scattering in Fig. 2.
We note that the volume scattering coefficient was computed for the entire vol-
ume occupied by the spherically scattering signal [1]. IL is improbable that
the fishes occupied the entire spherical scattering layer situated at this dis-
tance r from the emission-reception point and synchronously approaching the
acoustic system or withdrawing from it. Evidently the observed shoal occupied a
solid angle considerably smaller than 631 and the values of the volume scatter-
ing coefficient IV within the "target" must be substantially greater. An approx-
imate evaluation of mv within the "target" on the assumption that the mean dis-
tance to the shoal was 10-15 m. and the shoal itself had a spherical form with
a radius 5 m. gave an IV value exceeding the value computed for the entire vol-
ume by two orders of magnitude, which substantially exceeds the nv values known
in the literature for a frequency 5 KHz.

Unfortunately, the limitation of experimental material at the present time does
not make it possible to give the numerical characteristics of the spatial-tempor-
al variations of the volume scattering coefficient in the sound-scattering lay-
er. Henceforth such measurements will be continued.

[Text] Abstract: The authors made a laboratory study
of the development of amplitude and frequency
modulation of a regular surface wave under the
influence of an internal wave up to the forma-
tion of slicks. It was found that in the spec-
trum of a surface wave there are satellites
displaced by a frequency which is a multiple
of the frequency of the internal wave. The
number of satellites increases with the length
of the interaction.

1. As is well known. great attention is being devoted to the problem of invest-
igating internal waves (1") on the basis of their manifestations on the wave-
covered sea surface, which have the form of slicks. A considerable number of
studies (for example. see [1, 3, 5, 6] and the bibliography cited there) are
devoted to the in situ study of slicks, and also a theoretical analysis of the
interaction of internal and surface waves. With respect to laboratory investi-
gations. it is possible to mention only a single study [7] in which an invest-
igation was made of the influence of a monochromatic internal wave on a regular
surface wave (8"). As was demonstrated in [7], an internal wave leads to the
modulation of a 8" both in amplitude and wavelength; the strongest effect is
observed with satisfaction of resonance conditions: coincidence of the phase
velocity c of an internal wave with the group velocity c8 of surface waves.
However, in [7] a study was made of an extremely weak interaction in which it
was possible to examine only the initial stage in the development of modula-
tion. In this article a study is made of a stronger interaction of SR and I",
characterized by a considerable broadening of the spectrum of an initially
monochromatic SH and the transformation of 8", up to the stage of slick forma-
tion.

2. Instrumentation and measurement method. The experiments were carried out in-

dependently using two laboratory apparatuses: experiment I -- in a flume at the
Institute of Applied Physics. USSR Academy of Sciences (measuring b.5 x 0.b x
0.3 m). experiment 11 -- in a flame at Moscow State University (measuring

8.25 x 0.6 x 0.6 m). A two-layer stratification model was used in the experi-
ments; the upper layer was fresh water and the lower layer was a solution of
sodium chloride with densities varying in the range from 1.06 to 1.13 g-cm‘3
in experiment I and from 1.013 to 1.06 g-cm'3 in experiment II. A dye was in-
troduced into one of the layers for the visualization of I". In both apparat-
uses 1w were excited by using plates oscillating with an adjustable frequency
and amplitude about a horizontal axis situated at the interface of the fluids
(Fig. l). The frequencies F of the I" generated by the wave producer varied
in the range from 0.05 to 0.3 Hz and their heights varied from 0.5 to 3 cm.
SW were created using wave producers of the vibrational type generating waves
with frequencies f from 2 to 10 Hz and with amplitudes 0.1-1 mm. Sufficiently
effective wave dampers for I" and S" were placed at the end of the flumes
(the fraction of reflected wave energy in no case exceeded 101).

Haves were measured with electrode wave recorders supplied a d-c current. The
working part of the wave recorder is an electrode across which the voltage is
dependent on the spreading resistance of the submergible part, which makes
it possible to register a wave on the basis of change in submergence depth.

Experiment I was made using two wave recorders: one for measuring the SH and
the other for I" (the working part of the second wave recorder was placed in
the interface between fresh and salt water and was isolated from the surface).
The wave recorders were calibrated using a device for inducing vertical oscil-
lations of electrodes with stipulated amplitudes and frequencies. It was es-
tablished that the sensors have a good linearity (no worse than 11) and their
readings are not dependent on the frequency of oscillations at least to fre-
quencies of 15 Hz. Signals from both wave recorders were registered on an auto-
matic recorder and also with a measuring magnetic recorder with subsequent an-
alysis of the SH spectrum on an analog computer. An example of a simultaneous
record of SH and IV is shown in Pig. 2,a. The corresponding spectra of SW at
different distances x from the wave producer of S" are represented in Fig. 3.

In experiment II we used one wave recorder registering the total displacements
for I" and sw. In the registry we used a five-channel automatic recorder. reg-
istry with which was accomplished both directly from the wave recorder and af-
ter the signal passed through a selective amplifier. The presence of an ampli-
fier with a frequency characteristic having a sharp dropoff in the low-frequency
region made it possible to have separate registry of the SH and 1w profiles. A
photographic survey through the side wall of the flume was used in determining
the heights and lengths of I". The amplitude of the horizontal velocity U of

the orbital motion of particles in an internal wave near the surface was usual-
ly computed in experiments on the basis of the measured amplitude A of inter-
face displacement. For a two-layer stratification model it is easy to obtain

U - AR(shKh)'1, where IZ- 2n 1’ is the angular frequency of the I"; K is the
wave number of the IV; h is the depth of the upper homogeneous layer. In addi-
tion. in experiment II a film anemometer was used in making individual direct
measurements of the modulus of the horizontal component of orbital velocity at
different depths ha and different distances from the wave producer. Figure 2.b
is an example of registry of the horizontal velocity modulus. The figure clearly
shows velocity fluctuations associated with both SH and I". In the interpreta-
tion of the record it must be taken into account that the sensor measures only

the velocity modulus. As a result of these measurements, in addition to the

fluctuation component of the velocity of particles in the internal wave it was
possible to detect the presence gf_a constant wake whose intensity was 0.5 cm-
sec' .

3. Results of experiments. With the excitation of a harmonic SH in the presence
of an I" in the experiments there was a relatively rapid (at distances of about
0.5—1 m) appearance of amplitude and frequency modulation of S" (Fig. 2,a). Ac-
cordingly in the energy spectrum of 8H, initially having a peak at the frequency
to, satellites were formed at the frequencies f0 + or. With an increase in dis-
tance both amplitude and frequency modulation increased and accordingly there
was an increase in the number of satellites, attaining 6-7. The S" spectrum be-
came increasingly asymmetric: the amplitudes of the high-frequency (n >0) sat-
ellites exceeded the amplitudes of the low-frequency satellites (n<0) (Pig.
3). Finally. at lengths of about 1-2 m the amplitude modulation attained 1002,
after which the S" were broken down into individual trains separated by sectors
of almost smooth water -- slicks. It should be noted that the slicks were also
observed visually. After the breakdown of S" into trains the frequency modula-
tion decreased and accordingly the high-frequency part was suppressed in the

SH spectra. This is evidently associated with the strong damping effect of the
surface-active film, which, despite the cleaning of the surface, to some degree
was present on the water surface.

First we will discuss the resonance characteristics. Figure 4 shows the depend-
ence of the amplitude modulation coefficient a determined in emperiment II on
the value of the velocity ratio c/cg with fixed Kr. It can be seen that with
approach of the dc value to unity the m value increases and attains a maxim
with cacs. This indicates a resonance character of the interaction, for the
first time experimentally confirmed by measurements [7]. It should only be
noted that the resonance observed in this case is broadened in comparison with

[7]. which is associated with greater 0 values and accordingly with a greater
interval of lengths of the trapped SH [1].

The results presented below from measurement of the m and V parameters relate
to resonance interaction when cgc . Figure 5 gives the uperimental values of

periment II, in the region Kx>8 - with p - 0.029 and 0.04 on the basis of the

al to the amplitude (orbital velocity) of the I" and increases with distance.

4. Discussion of results. The authors of [7), in an investigation of the influ-
ence of IN on the characteristics of SW. made use of the equations of geo-
metrical optics for slowly changing amplitude and wave number of a quasimono—
chromatic S" in the field of a variable current created by an IV. 0n the assump-
tion of smallness of change in 8" parameters computations were made of the de-
pendence of the coefficients of modulation of the amplitude a and the wave

whlx'll agrees with the evaluation of the SH "blocking length" [1]. It should
he noted that there is a good agreement between experiment and computations
[7] up to lengths not exceeding x. (in the experiments Rxav-le-lZ). This is
understandable since the formulas in [7], in general, describe weak modulation
and are incorrect in the stage of slick formation, that is, with x2 x,.

In a study of the spectra of SW it is more convenient to proceed from the spec-
tral form of writing of equations for the interaction of 1H and SH. The equa-
tions describing the evolution of the complex spectral amplitude at the
carrier frequency 0 - 211E and the spectral amplitudes of the sate lites an

at the frequencies a) + n.0, appearing with the presence of I" with the spectral
amplitude A, can be written in the following form (compare [4]):

here V is a matrix coefficient of nonlinear interaction between I“ and S“; An
is wave frequency difference, which under the condition 32< a), K< k is equal
to An - K [(1 - Clcs) + c “He ldkxn]. Computations of the interaction coef—
ficient, carried out, in pagtic er, in [2], neglecting the dependence on n
for the case of short SH, give the following result

Neglecting the frequency difference, and also not taking into account the de-
pendence of V on n, it is possible to write a precise solution of system (2).

Allowance for A(n) and V(n) leads to the appearance of amplitude modulation,
but if the characteristic length of development of frequency modulation

is small. the appearance of satellites at these distances is associated prinar-
ily with frequency nodulation. In Pig. 3 the crosses indicate the tuplitudes of
the sate1lites, conputed in accordance with (6). It can be seen that at dis-
tehces x~'x.,the spectra of S" in actuality are described well by expression

[Text] Abstract: On the basis of an analysis of
the spectral wave equation in a ray ap-
proximation the author has derived ex-
pressions for the spatial-temporal en-
ergy spectra for internal waves in the
ocean.

In connection with the increasing volume of information on internal waves in
the ocean and the development of theory it is possible to predict some mean
state of the wave field for the open part of the ocean. The principal attain-
nents in this field were made by Garret and Hunk. who for the first tine pro-
posed a background spectral model in 1972 [3]. A discussion of the further de-
velopaent of the nodal is given in [lo-6]. The essence of the employed senien-
pirical method is that on the basis of linearized equations describing the
phenoaanon in the main thermocline and sons physical assunptions it is possible
to develop an analytical power-law form of spectru- and then with the use of
extensive factual material select the values of the free paraneters, including
the exponents.

Our model is based on an equation for linear internal waves in spectral form
and the unique (following tron observations) important assunption that the
spectral level is poorly dependent on geographic latitude.

The following equation was derived in [1, 2] for describing the evolution of
the spectral density of waves in a ray approximation

He will examine equation (1) for internal waves in an ideal, incompressible,

where P is the local fluid density. In general, the parameter f should be
among thg determining parameters. However, in [7]. where a study was made of
the frequency spectra in the main thermocline. it was established on the basis
of data from field measurements that the form of the spectrum in the mediate
neighborhood of the equator and far from it is invariable. whereas the level
changes insignificantly. This gives basis for excluding f from among the para-
neters to be determined. It is possible that the entire dependence of the B
spectrum on f is contained in . Taking advantage of the fact that the de-
pendence of the sought-for func ion in (S) on the independent variables has
the self-similar form

these waves must be sufficiently long in coaparison with depth of the fluid.
Baa-plea of observation of gravitational two-diaeneional solitons at the sur-
face of a fluid under laboratory conditions are evidently lacking. Accordingly,
the hope arises of creating two-diaansional gravitational-capillary solitons
under laboratory conditions, since their length can be substantially less than
the length of purely gravitational aolitons. Moreover. as indicated by the text
which follovs, in the case of an adequately snail depth of the fluid (less than
0.5 on for water) it lakes sense to examine specifically only tuo-dinensional

gravitational-capillary solitons because the corresponding one-dimensional sol-
itons are unstable. Although iron the general point of view the existence of
gravitational-capillary solitons is quite obvious (fron an examination of the
dispersion expression for linear gravitational-capillary waves), there is no
accurate derivation of the corresponding C—DV equation from the initial equa-
tions of hydrodynamics. In this connunication we give such a derivation for a
two-dinenaional case, based on the direct use of an asymptotic procedure pro-
posed by Leonov [3] for the case of the general equations of hydrodynanics for
a stratified fluid in a gravity field.

gravity and surface tension, leading to gravitational-capillary waves in a
fluid layer with a horizontal bottom. Although the equation in [7] for two-
dinensional solitons also takes surface tension into account, it does not be-
long to the type of the two-dimensional C-DV equation [2] and does not under-
go transition into the equation derived in this study, with a tendency of the
angle of the inclined plane to zero (transition to the case of a horizontal
bottom).

He will examine a horizontal unbounded fluid layer of the depth h. If as the
len th scale we use layer depth h and as the time scale -— the value ‘1' - (h3/
Y) ’2 (Y is the ratio of the surface tension coefficient to fluid density),

the dimensionless equations of motion and the boundary conditions can he writt-

These equations were written in a rectangular coordinate system with the hor-

We will examine long waves propagating in the direction of the x—axis with
the velocity c and slowly changing in the transverse direction y. Adhering
to [3]. we introduce the new variables

We note that in this case the wave slope in the direction of the x-sxis (that
is, 35/3 at) is proportional to 53, whereas the wave slope in the direction
of the y-axis (that is, a1; /2 y) is proportional to 6", which corresponds to

dinate y than from the longitudinal coordinate x. The & paraneter lust be re-
garded as an index of the order of Iagnitude of the corresponding parsneters;
in the final expressions it is absent.

The equations 'for the spproxinations are obtained by substituting (6). (7) into

Equation (11) is also the two-dimensional c-DV equation for the considered
case. With an accuracy to the insignificant numerical coefficients equation
(13) was for the first time derived in [2] for waves of an arbitrary nature
allowing the one-dimensional C-DV equation. We note that the one-dimensional
variant of linearized equation (11) corresponds to the following approximation
to the precise linear dispersion expression

(N is frequency, 1: is was number), from which is obvious the very fact of
existence of the c-DV equation for the gravitational-capillary ves. For
water the dispersion parameter is positive with h) ho - (Zh’lg)1 2% 0.5 cm;

in this case the phase velocity of the linear waves w/k accordingly decreases
with an increase in the wave number (negative dispersion). With h<h the dis-

persion parameter p is negative and in this case the phase velocity reases
with an increase in the wave number (positive dispersion). He also note that
the c-nv equation for purely gravitational waves can be derived from (11), as-
suming formally that co - 1, ,9 - 1/6; with this sane time scale it is neces-
sary to assume that T - (h/g)1/2. The case ﬂ - 0 requires allowance for high-
er-order dispersion.

Kadomtsev and Petviashvili [2] demonstrated that with disruption of rigorous
one-dimensionality, described within the framework of equation (13), one-
dimensional solitons for the c-nv equation are stable with ﬁ>0 and unstable
with ,B<0 (also see [5], which gives a precise solution of the stability
problem). Thus, with h<ho the one-dimensional gravitational-capillary soli-
tons are unstable. However. in this case (ﬂ<0) there can be a fundamentally
new class of solutions -- stable two-dimensional rational (or algebraic) sol-
itons. the analytical expressions for which can be written explicitly in
rational functions.

The series of precise solutions for the two-dimensional c-nv equation in the
case P>o was obtained in (to. 5]. For this case we will cite a solution of
equation (11) of the sloping soliton type

- -2 L 5:“. "' - -

where Em is the maximum of the 5' function; V - c (1 +12/2+ {u/Z) is the
velocity of the soliton and )L is an arbitrary rea number. It can therefore
be seen that the velocity V of the soliton in the case of a fixed amplitude
5., is the greater the greater its "slope" x. 0n the other hand, with a fix-
ed velocity V the amplitude In decreases with an increase in the slope 7..

A precise solution of the two-dimensional c-DV solution describing the instab-
ility in the case ﬂ<0 was obtained in [5] and a precise solution in the form
of stable two-dimensional rational solitons was derived in [6]. For the

In contrast to solution (15), describing "wall-like humps" with infinitely
long crests along the straight lines 1- xy-Vt - 0 (and this neans, not atten-
uating along these straight lines). solution (16) corresponds to troughs at-
tenuating with x, y» no as l/(x2 + yz). The minus depth of the trough In
(amplitude of the soliton) also is attained with x' - y' - 0. However, beyond
the linits of the trough there is some positive rise of the water whose height
is alnost an order of magnitude less than the depth of the depression {- (see
Fig. l). The zero-level lines for the fluid are hyperbolas (figure. a). The

I -section along the x'-axis always has positive "hmps" of the height I IIIl8
(figure. h) and the ,5 -section along the y'-axis has positive "hunps" only

in a case when the branches of the hyperbole intersect the y'-axis. Other-
wise the section along the y'-axis has no "humps" (figure, c). Thus. the
trough is situated between the branches of the hyperbola. The positioning of

121

the hyperbola on the (x', y') plane is dependent on the relationship of the

a and b constants. Using the formulas cited above, the velocity vs can be rep-

fron which it can be seen that the velocity of propagation of such a soliton
is less than the velocity of the long waves c, but in actual practice this

difference is extremely insignificant. During collision such solitons do not
interact with one another [6].

In conclusion we vill cite an example of computations by the formulas given
above. He will examine the case b - 0. In this case v - O and the ax s of

can be described using a stochastic "facet" nodel [1-3]. In this case allow-
ance must be nade for the concealment from observation of facets uhose slopes
are steeper than the slope of the sighting line and the circmstance that
anong the remaining facets only sone of then directly reflect in the direction
of the observer the radiation fron the sky. since in the radiation of the
facets shaded relative to the sky or reflecting the radiation of the part of
the space below the horizon line the descending sky radiation participates
only due to multiple reflection effects. The influence of these factors is
evaluated by introducing the ao-called shading function [l-lo] S(?. 0’). which
within the franeuork of the assmption of a predominant value of single-re-
flection processes in the formation of sea radiance is independent of the
rises and slopes of the facets. The general expression for the nean conponent
of energy brightness of the wave-covered surface L(¢,1}’) in this case has the

Evaluations of the possible contribution to sea radiation from the effects of
multiple reflection were made by a comparison of the values of the coefficients
A and z. computed for the conditions of total reflection and total absorption
of sky radiation accompanying multiple reflection. Computations show that the
change of the A values for most real hydrometeorological situations does not
exceed 151, and, for example, with V - 10 m/sec -- from 6 to 122.

The slight spectral dependence of the coefficients A, 2. c1, C2 is attributable
to the averaging in (1) of the coefficients of reflection from the facets in a
wide range of slopes (Fig. l). The general relationship 0(02<2<A<P(d) is
retained with all observation conditions, whereas the dependence of the coef-
ficients A, z, C1 and 02 on the angle of elevation of the sighting line ‘-
12/2 - Z is characterized by their smooth decrease from maximum values in the
case of grazing angles of observation to minimum values in the case of nadir
observations for all states of the wave-covered surface. For isotropic non-
directional waves the angle-of-elevation profiles for A, 2. C1 and C; are
identical, but for well-developed waves with .5 increase in the angle between
the direction of predominant wave propegation and the direction of observation
the change in the characteristics of sea radiation is similar to the decrease
in the degree of waves. d, '

physical and mathematical sciences]

[Text] Seismic prospecting can be said to have been formalized into an inde-
pendent scientific discipline in the 1930's with the creation of the physical
and theoretical principles of methods for investigating stratified media by
refracted and reflected waves. These methods were developed considerably in
the l940's-l950's: their exploratory capabilities had increased and their
detail, effective depth and reliability were greatly enhanced. The last
decade has been notable for new major advances in seismic prospecting. The
introduction of nonexplosive pulsed and vibrational sources is affording the
possibility for shaping seismic sounding signals with stipulated properties
with directional radiation of longitudinal and transverse waves. New methods
for the processing of information. developed in the Soviet Union and abroad,
are gak1ng it posgible to construct the three-dimensional (and not plane.

as was the case before) velocity fields of seismic waves within the framework
of relatively simple determined models.

At the_same tine, seismic prospecting is faced with new tasks: study of com-
plexly dislocated media. detection of nonstructural deposits of petroleum and
gas, direct search for deposits, that is. the prediction of petroleum and gas
deposits. ore bodies. etc. on the basis of a combination of parameters of the
seismic wave field. and also tasks associated with the problems of seismic re-
gionalization, investigations of the focal zones of strong earthquakes. burial
of radioactive matter. etc. Even now it has become clear that the possibilit-
ies of traditional methods in many cases are limited and their limits can be
clearly seen. Are there further possibilities for the development of seismic
prospecting and experimental seismology? As indicated by the history of sci-
ence. in order to take a considerable step forward in the development of any
branch of science there must be a challenge to the main hypotheses of pheno-
menology; it is necessary to shake a little the foundation on which the struc-
ture of a scientific law has been built.

Existing seismic prospecting and seismology methods are based on the concept
that rocks are a continuous linear-elastic medium in which seismic waves are
identically propagated, regardless of their amplitude. and do not interact

130

with one another; the medium is passive. it absorbs but does not radiate seis-
mic energy; it is unchanged with time. In addition, it is assumed that the ex-
ploratory capabilities of the seismic method have a fundamental limitation
associated with the lengths of waves: small inhomogeneities cannot be detect-
ed by waves whose length exceeds their size by several times.

This is a strong schematization of the properties of a real medium which in
actuality is not continuous. but instead is discrete, lumpy and contains an
entire hierarchy of scales of inhomogeneities. It would be natural to regard
the real medium as a system of entities which are in different stressed
states. In accordance with the probabilistic distribution of stresses by en-
tities, some small number of then already from the very beginning of the im-
parting of an external force must be in a state close to instability. There-
fore, even a slight force from the outside will cause a change in the proper-
ties and energy state of the system with time. as is in actuality observed.

Real rocks have well-expressed nonlinear elastic properties, constantly radi-
ate microseismic oscillations (seismic emission) and experience temporal

changes in connection with changes in stressed state caused by geodynamic and
geochemical processes. A theoretical investigation of such systems lies beyond

the possibilities of the mechanics of continuous linear-elastic, elastico-
plastic and other models of the medium. In order to take into account the
probabilistic character of the processes transpiring in the real medium it

is necessary to have a new research approach based on the methods of statis-
tical physics and opening the way to study of the temporal development of the
processes in the system. The formulation of such a theory is a matter of the
future. However. many useful results can also be obtained by ordinary methods,
by determining the deviations of the results of experimental observations from
those prescribed by linear theory.

The possibilities of detailed inves-
tigations of the medium do not have
fundamental limitations with respect
to the lengths of the waves and the
dimensions of the inhomogeneities.
There are methods for extracting in-
formation on the fine structure of
the medium from the lowhfrequency
wave field. This requires special
planning and processing of observa-
tions.

Studies in the field of seismology
which are being carried out at the
Institute of Physics of the Earth

Sciences, are directed to study of
the still little-known properties of
real media, the possibilities and

es in the focal zones of shots and

In this method the medium under a group of recording instruments is probed by
waves transmitted downward from remote sources which reveal at the surface of
the anomaly their travel time, their amplitude and shape. making it possible

to ascertain the structure of the medium. The idea of use of remote sources
was proposed by Academician G. A. Gamburtsev in the 1960's but was develop-
ed no further in exploratory geophysics. Methods for interpreting such obser-
vations were developed in seismology with the appearance of areal seismic
arrays.

Figure 1 shows a three-dimensional seismic section under the NORSAR group* in
southern Norway according to data published by K. Aki (United States). 3.
Busebi and C. Christofferaon (Norway). The section was constructed on the
basis of the travel times of waves from earthquakes whose foci were in the
entire range of azimuths with epicentral distances of 3000-8000 km.

An analysis of the possibilities of the method for probing by use of remote
sources for studying depths up to 10 km indicated that its use requires dense
areal registry networks, "shooting" of the investigated volume from different
azimuths. and a high signal-to-noiso ratio. A special feature of the method
is its capability for differentiating primarily horizontal inhomogeneities;
it is not sensitive to plane layering. In seismic probing of this type the
rays only once pass through the investigated volume. greatly distorting the
wave field.

The experimental studies of the Institute of Physics of the Earth in the Pri-
pyatskiy downwarp demonstrated the fundamental possibility of using both
shots at a distance of 200-300 km and earthquakes whose foci are at a dis-
tance of several thousand km**. Figure 2 gives examples of the record of a
remote earthquake registered in the neighborhood of the Vostochno-Pervomaysk-
oye petroleum deposit in Belorussia. The first longitudinal waves transmitt-
ed through the deposit were impoverished in the high frequencies. This char-
acteristic, together with others, can be used as an indicator in the direct
search for petroleum and gas.

In the future the investigation of large areas by seismic probing can be en-
sured by a network of stationary vibrational sources which are situated at
distances of about 500 km from one another.

Another method for studying the upper part of the medium under a group of seis-
mic stations at which remote sources are employed applies the holographic prin-
ciple of construction of inhomogeneities scattering seismic waves. Classical
holography uses harmonic sources. Pulsed sources can also be used, but this
requires the special transformation of the registered signals. their equiva-
lent reduction to a harmonic source. In the image reconstruction method each

point of the medium is seemingly "interrogated" as to whether it is a seat-
terer and then. when all the points are interrogated, the results are-mapp-

ed.

Figure 3 shows a section under the RORSAR seismic group constructed by P. A.
troitskiy on the basis of data from the registry of remote earthquakes for a
frequency of 1.8 Hz. An unexpected result was obtained: columnar inhomogen-
eities passing through the entire lithosphere were detected. The method of
seismoholographic investigations was tested and validated by ultrasonic

modeling.

At the scale of seismic prospecting investigations in the field of seismic
holography are being carried out at the Siberian Department, USSR Academy
of Sciences. where convincing results have been obtained.

The seismoholography method can use microseismic oscillations. The idea is
that each individual scatterer in the medium reradiates microseismic oscil-
lations. This secondary radiation has an ordered spatial structure. Visual-
ize that an object floats on the water surface. A random water wave is re-
radiated by this object and "rings" diverge from it. If the object became in-
visible, from these circles it would be possible to guess that it was pres-
ent specifically in this place. Thus, microseismic random oscillations can
be used on a par with oscillations from pulsed or harmonic sources for
studying the structure of real media. Such a method requires observations

by means of a dense sys an of stations over the investigated object. the
processing of data from long-term registry. It was developed at the Insti-
tute of Physics of the Earth, tested using materials from the NORSAR group.
The "section" obtained by this method for a depth of 100 km has a similar-
ity to the "section" obtained using the already described holographic scheme.

The structure of the field of micro-
seismic oscillations is closely re-
lated to medium structure. In par-
ticular, the impoverishment of micro-
seisms with high frequencies and a
decrease in their intensity is ob-
served in regions having increased
absorpzion properties. The studies of

Investigations of the structure of microseismic oscillations are being carr~
ied out in West Germany and in the United States for the purpose of finding

zones of increased heating. sources of thermal energy which have strong ab-

sorption properties and thus serve as an outlet for microseiema. But a real

medium, it appears. is not only an outlet. but also a source of microseisms:
it has seismic emission.

Figure 5 shows records of the envelope of microseismic noise obtained at dif-
ferent times by the seismic observatory "Obninsk.* . The lower records clearly .
show a periodicity associated with the natural oscillations of the earth after
strong earthquakes. The envelope spectrum contains all the main modes of the
natural oscillations. The earth's natural oscillations modulate high-fre-
quency microseisms in amplitude. and this means that the reason for micro-
seisms is both external, exogenous sources, and also internal sources --
microfracturing constantly occurring in the medium. A detailed analysis makes
it possible to detect fluctuations in the level of nicroseisms caused by
lunar-solar tidal deformations.

The intensity of the emission is related to state of the medium and its frac-
turing at different scales; accordingly. the character of the emission carr-
ies information on these qualities of the medium. During recent years inter-
est in this emission has been tied in to the prospects of using this pheno-
menon for earthquake prediction. A study is now being made of the possibility
of using seismic emission in the exploration for minerals. For the time being

It is unclear whether a deposit of petroleum or gas is an adequately lnivn-
ulvv source of microseisms and to what extent the anomaly of this quality is
expressed relative to the surrounding rocks. There is indirect evidence that
ore bodies should be sources of high-frequency microseisms.

Seismic emission makes a significant contribution to the field of high-frequen-
cy -- 10's of Hz -- microseismic oscillations. Accordingly. the spatial anomal-
ies of the statistical characteristics of high-frequency microseisms are relat-
ed not only to peculiarities of structure of the upper part of the medium. but
also to the spatial distribution of microseismic activity, which can serve as

a direct indication of presence of a deposit.

It has been established that vibrational oscillations stimulate seismic emis-
sion. This circumstance makes possible a substantial broadening of the possib-
ility of investigating a new phenomenon and quality of real media -- the caps-
bility to "shed" microseismic oscillations, "to clarify themselves."

It has been established by recent investigations of structure of the seismic
wave field near vibrational sources carried out by the Institute of Physics
of the Earth and the Scientific Research Institute of Radiophysical Measure-
ments that in sedimentary rocks, such as sandy loam and clayey loasnconsider-
able nonlinear effects can appear even when there are insignificant deforma-
tions (10‘5-10'6). The nonlinearity coefficient

K - v(dv/dp)

(fDis density, v is the velocity of a longitudinal wave, p is pressure) de-
termines the degree of the nonlinear effect of an elastic medium. In uncon-
solidated ground it attains values 10‘ and possibly greater; in consolidated
monolithic rocks it is about several tens. The K parameter is an important
physical characteristic of the medium and therefore it is extremely desirable
to learn how to determine it in the upper part of the section - to a depth
of 5-10 km.

As is well known, heterogeneous triphase media have strong nonlinear propert-
ies and therefore there is every basis for assuming that petroleum deposits
constitute clear anomalies of the nonlinearity coefficient.

A number of effects are related to nonlinear elasticity: interaction of seis-
mic waves, characteristic distortions of harmonic signals. The interaction is
expressed, for example, in the development of low-frequency waves with the
interference of high-frequency waves with close frequencies. In this process
bests arise at a low frequency, oscillations are detected (are nonlinearly
distorted) by the medium, as a result of which a low-frequency wave is formed.

Another effect is distortion of a harmonic wave as it propagates in a nonlin-
early elastic medium. The wave in this case acquires the form of a relatively
complex periodic oscillation. This means that a part of the seismic energy
passes into the higher harmonics. The development of high-frequency oscilla-
tions at multiple frequencies can be used for detecting volumes of the medium
having anomalously high values of the nonlinearity coefficient. For example,

it is possible to irradiate a definite region of the medium by harmonic seis-
mic oscillations at some fundamental frequency. with the registry in this

case of waves of multiple frequencies. Using areal reception systems, it is
possible to find the directions to the sources of high-frequency seismic oscil-
lations -- the regions of anomalously strong nonlinear properties. Low-fre-
quency seismic waves will develop in these same regions if they are irradi-
ated by high-frequency harmonic signals close in frequency.

The described effects indicate ways to detect the volumes of the medium hav-
ing anomalously strong absorbing properties. It is important that nonlinear
elasticity is also present in other phenomena - temporal changes in the
velocities of propagation of waves associated with a change in the field of
stresses.

Finally. although this problem is beyond the framework of seismology. it is
impossible not to note that the model of the medium in the form of a system
of rock entities (blocks), in addition to a close approach to a real medium
from the point of view of a description of its mechanical properties, has
still another highly important quality. The natural assumption that there is
an interblock space (slits between entities). filled with gas or fluid. im-
mediately makes it possible to find the reason for numerous electromagnetic
processes observable during rock deformation; Seismoelectric effects have
long been known, but until now have not been used in detecting and studying
the nonlinear properties of rock.

In connection with the problem of earthquake prediction, during the last dec-
ade great interest has been shown in temporal changes in the velocities of
seismic waves. It has been established that prior to strong earthquakes there
is a decrease in the ratio of the velocities of longitudinal and transverse
waves in the focal region and both velocities decrease. After an earthquake
the velocities are restored.

The change in the velocities of elastic saves is associated with a change in
the stressed state of the medium, the concentration of stresses before an
earthquake in the focal region. The effects of a change in velocities attain
several percent.

In seismically passive regions the change in the stressed state of the medium
is associated primarily with tidal deformations. Although these deformations
are only 10‘8-10'9, the relative change in the velocities of seismic waves in
the upper part of the earth's crust in this case attains 10'“. It can be seen
that the effect is not great but it can be detected and used in determining
the nonlinearity coefficient.

The clearly expressed anomalies of nonlinear effects associated with a depos-
it of petroleum or gas should give stronger effects, which makes it possible
to detect them despite the relatively small (kilometers) spatial dimension.

A study of the temporal changes in the medium requires use of systematic prob-
ings using sources having a high operational stability. Systematic probings
can be coordinated with a study of the medium using remote sources. Taking
into account that source-instrument distances of hundreds and a few

thousand kilometers will be overcome by seismic probings in the very near
future, we arrive at the conclusion that it is feasible to combine programs
for investigations in the field of seismic prospecting, on the one hand.

and in the field of earthquake prediction, on the other, since both tasks can
be solved using a single network of stationary seismic sources.

The problems involved in seismic prospecting and earthquake prediction, de-
spite the difference, have much in common: both are directed to detecting

a spatial inhomogeneity on the basis of a combination of geophysical fields,
both constant and variable with time. The focal region is characterized by
relatively rapid temporal changes in elastic properties: in its development
an inhomogeneity undergoes a number of phases and then. after a strong earth-
quake, virtually disappears. A deposit is an almost time-invariable formation,
but at the same time reversible changes occur in it, caused by the effect of
tidal deformations.

The ideas of the new prospecting methods mentioned above were developed in
seismology in connection with the problems of earthquake prediction. Thus,
investigations for the prediction of earthquakes seemingly became model ex-
periments relative to the problemslencountsred in seismic prospecting. Taking
into account the internal similarity of the problems, it can be assumed that
other methods of earthquake prediction can be used in the reconnaissance and
exploration of mineral deposits. In particular. precise geodetic measure-
ments. study of the variation of tilts and deformations caused by lunar-solar
tides should also reveal anomalies associated with the deposit.

It should be noted that in the solution of problems in seismic prospecting
and earthquake prediction the instrumentation and methods for field observa-
tionsg the procedures for the interpretation'of'data obtained by individual
methods and multisided interpretation are the same._The bringing_together of
the efforts of scientists for solution of these problems'will considerably
enhance the effectiveness of scientific research and design work.

There is still another aspect of the discussed problems. For the time being

new seismic prospecting methods are in the earliest stage in their develop-
ment. Regardless of how effective they may prove to be in the future, they

will not completely replace traditional methods because they are oriented on
obtaining qualitatively different information on the medium. In addition. a
deep study of the physical phenomena associated with wave propagation in real
media will make it possible to improve the theory and method for the interpret-
ation of traditional seismic prospecting methods.

Investigations of the new physical principles for seismic prospecting were in-
itiated very recently, but even now it is clear that the seismic prospecting
method has great possibilities for development in new directions, which will
determine its scientific and technical progress after 5-10 years.
