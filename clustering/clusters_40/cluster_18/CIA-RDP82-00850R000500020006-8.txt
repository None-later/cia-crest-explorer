FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY

PRESSURE PROM GREENS "INS W 0N HERBICIDE
Hamburg CAPITAL in German Nov 81 pp 28, 29
[Article by Mans-Josef Joest: "Poisoning the Hell"]

[Text] Bonn wants to pacify the "Greens" by banning the 2,6,5—T
herbicide; it is said to be carcinogenic. But the expert
specially hired in the matter denies that it is health-threatening.

Germany's "Greens" can cross one item off their protest list: the herbicide
2,6,5—T. Spectacular protest actions such as the siege of the chimneys in the
factory of the only German 2.6.S-T manufacturer. C.I. Boehringer Sohn in Hamburg
and massive lobbying with coalition politicians have shown results. The Federal
Health Office (BOA) and the Federal Biological Institute for Agriculture and
Forestry (33A) have cancelled their permit to manufacture the herbicide as of
October 1982 because it is strongly suspected of being e carcinogen.

This total prohibition came as a shock to the manufacturers who had counted on

no more than mandatory instructions for use of the compound, such as protective
clothing. The Calanerck Plant Protection Corp. in Ingelheim (jointly owned by
0.8. Boehringer Sohn and by B. Merck) and other manufacturers have protested the
ban. Celamerck considers the revocation of the permit for the manufacture and use
of the 2,b,S-T trichlorphenoxy acetic acid to be "unequivocally politically
motivated and scientifically unjustified."

As recently as last spring the Bonn government considered the herbicide spray for
eradicating dead-nettle, bindveed and broomveed to be harmless. In reply to an
inquiry by SPD and FD? Bundestag delegates (reference 9/379). the Ministry of
Agriculture stated that "the most recent comprehensive scientific test of all
currently available data was made by 15 independent scientists in Great Britain.
The results show that with careful use of these compounds according to directions
there is no danger to humans. animals and the environment."

Nor did Prof Dr Ulrich Mohr, expert on carcinogenic chemicals at the Bannover
Medical School, who retested a study of 2,6,S-T, produced by the Dov Chemical
Company for the 0.8. National Institutes of Realty, find any significant suspicion
of carcinogenicity. But the BOA chose to ignore the judgment of the scientist
whom it has itself hired at the taxpayers' expense. In a hearing about health
hazards of 2.6,S-T it alloued the professor only a few minutes in which to run

through his results in a bare outline. Hohr did his duty. His favorable judgment
of 2,4,5-T no longer fitted the political equation.

In an interview with CAPITAL, Hohr pointed out that his results were no Justification
for the RCA judgment that 2,4.5-T causes cancer: "From the toxicological aspect

I was greatly surprised by this decision." The expert's bottom line: "In my
opinion 2,4,5—T is not as dangerous as it is said to be." Mohr's opinion confirms
the manufacturers' worry that 2,6,5-T is being used by former BGA president and
present state secretary in Bonn's health ministry, Prof Dr Georges Puelgraff as s
test case in the power struggle between politicians, scientists and industrialists
over the evaluation of hazards of environmental chemicals.

During the past year Puelgraff said at a meeting of the Industrial Association for
Plant Protection and Pesticides that in the future expert opinions would have to
be subordinated to the politicians' cosmos sense. Intoned the political professor:
"Health hazard evaluation (the probability and severity of possible damage) is

a scientific undertaking. However. the judgment of whether a hazard can be
tolerated from a socially adequate standpoint is a purely political function."

For several reasons, 2,A,S-T was eminently suitable as an illustration for this
political hazard scale. This herbicide:

--is burdened by a tarnished past as a defoliant in Vietnam (code name: Agent
Orange); however, it was sprayed there in a 5,000-fold concentration;

-it contains a non-removable residue of TCDD (Dioxin), a poison known to cause
cancer, 2,000 grams of which suddenly appeared in an area of 300 hectares in Seveso,
compared with 1 gram TCDD per year out of the herbicide 2,4,5-T on the 580,000
hectares of German soil;

—-is manufactured by only one German firm, 0.8. Boehringer Sohn, though the leading
Boehringer chemical enterprises process 2,4,S-T in 70 herbicide compounds;

--is on the prohibited list in Sweden, Holland and Italy due to political pressure;

--may, since March 1979, be used in the United States only on open prairie lands
and in rice p1anting-for political reasons. Said Puelgraff at the time: "I
consider this decision by the 0.5. authorities to be primarily a political one.
which was made by giving in to public pressure." However, when protests started
to swell in the PRC, Fuelgraff remembered his concept that "normal consensus in
society is subject to change." 2.4,5—T seemed ready to be sacrificed to the
"Greens" as a peace offering. BOA and 33A called a meeting and engaged Hohr to
put the Dow experiments in the United States to the test. This member of the
German research community found there what he described as "surely the most
comprehensive study of 2,4,5-T which has been done anywhere.” At the highest
test concentration the 0.3. scientists had found a tongue tumor in a rat-a
result, says Hohr. which they "openly presented to the public." But, agreeing
with the authors of the study, Hohr arrived at the conclusion that this tumor was
"not unequivocally caused by 2.4,SnT." Says Hohr about the difference between the
feeding experiment and practical use of the herbicide: "After all, we do not eat
it 23 hours later." That is why he does not see any "great hazard with proper
use.

But the PRC Health Agency interprets the study differently. It considers a cancer
hazard through use of 2,6,5-7 to be confirmed. BOA director Prof Dr Wolfgang Link
sees a “differential interpretation of test results." Apart fron a different
interpretation of the same test results, the ban is further based on an epidemiologi-
cal expert opinion about increased cancer risk for agricultural workers engaged

in spraying 2,4,5-T-s study which even Link considers "sethodologically questionable."
Nevertheless, Fuelgraff's ministry promises the "green" public that 2,0.5-1 is

being ousted as a result of "the most recent scientific findings." The Dow study

was made in 1979.

Announcing its intention to "use all legally available resources, as Celsnerck's

Dr Georg Leber puts it, the chemical industry appears deternined to enter the power
struggle between science and politics in hazard evaluation. Prof Hohr urges his
political employers: "There really should be an end to this hysteria."
