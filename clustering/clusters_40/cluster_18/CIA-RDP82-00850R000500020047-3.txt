[Text] Severance pay: what to do about it? Some empirical
findings and suggestions.

Premise

After nearly 2 years during which interest in the severance pay machi-
nery seemed to be declining, the issue has over the past several months
become one of keen concern. This is the result of the solicitation

of signatures on the petition for a referendum for repeal of the spe-
cific provisions in PL-9l which would'render meaningless the stops on
the economic barometer in the process of bringing the fund up to re-
quired levels; it is also an index to the desire to let go of a situa-
tion of stalemate whi.h, in the wake of renewed discussion and sugges-
tions for changes in this instiute over the course of 1975. 1976, and
1977, would tend to leave the situation unchanged for years to come.
The fact is that the provision of PL-91 has eased the impact of annual

payments into the fund on corporate bankrolls, as well as its burden on

diate access to a portion of his earnings, letting the company control
the quality and size of its own financial potential while weighing it
down quite seriously with commitments and burdens of a special kind.

The spark provided by the current challenge to PL-91 can thus open the
door to challenge on a far broader issue. To deal with the latter, how-
ever, it seems essential to develop some interpretive clarity, particu-
larly in relation to the real nature of the link which, through severance
pay, is established between the company-employer and the worker. It is
equally necessary to have adequate measurements in relation to the real
scope of the phenomenon and to the nature of its consequences.

1- A Two-Way Relationship

As we know, the worker receives as a consideration for the work he has
performed a remuneration which has a number of aspects and partakes
only partially of the nature of real disposable income. The severance
pay share is in this sense an integral part of his overall compensa-
tion which establishes the labor relationship on a contractual basis.
Once the worker has acquired the right to that quota and, under current
regulations, cannot have immediate access to it but rather leaves it
wholly in the hands of corporate management, it takes on the nature of
real financial backing for that management. The worker, in other words,
becomes the nominal owner of forced savings of a portion of his own
earnings, which he must leave in the possession of the company with
which it has accumulated. This is a very special financing operation:
by reason of the uncertainty of its term, dependent roughly speaking
on the duration of the job relationship; by reason of the type of re-
payment, which is not easy of access and stability apart from the au-
tonomous and individual decisions of the company and the worker-finan-
cier; and by reason of its non-spontaneous character. There cannot,
nevertheless, be any doubt as to the fact that, for whatever portion

he cannot have immediate access to, the worker becomes a real money-
lendcr to the company for which he works.

In line with this concept, we can recognize what might be properly in-
terpreted as a cost of financial assets thus acquired from production
or as repayment of financial advances. The laws and regulations gov-
erning the severance pay institution establish a de facto distinction
between the act of setting aside in the fund, relating to each year
(the relevant quota determined as to its varying size according to
whether the worker is unskilled, an office-worker, or an executive),
and the ace of setting aside in order to bring the existing fund up to
the requisite level on the basis of new wage scales (a portion of pre-
vious set-aside, resulting from the variation in the entitlement share
resulting from changes in wage scales multiplied by the employee's years
of service to the company). 8. Pilippi ) very cogently poin ; out
that one can say, as a good ballpark estimate, that the amount the com»
pany must come up with each year to bring the existing funds up to the
mark is, to all intents and purposes, the cost it must bear to keep
suchsums of money available. The annual burden on the corporate eco-
nomy for managing the severance pay fund should thus be split into

2

FOR|0FFNJALIEE§ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

two parts: one, relating to the share of entitlement, and hence part
of labor costs; and the other, relating to rc-evaluation of pre-

vious severance settlements, becoming part of the financial costs for
the capital thus obtained. Because he leaves the fund at the company's
disposal, the worker earns the right to its regular increase on the
basis of the (upward) variation in the compensation he receives: the
amount of the fund increase constitutes, in practical terms, a form of
interest coming due on the resources he is compelled to lend to the
company for the entire duration of his employment there. That sum will
in turn be left once more available to the company and will form an in-
tegral part of the machinery for further increases. Looking at the
whole thing through the worker's eyes, we clearly see the pattern of
what is nothing more or less than a loan of money under a compound ca-
pitalization scheme based on a variable rate pegged to the changes in
contract wages.

It would seem wise to remember this approach as we seek to formulate
some hypothesis that would solve the currently hot question of the
effects stemming from the application of PL-9l. Born in response to
the need to contain the spiralling costs of labor, that law in fact
affected the variability of the rate on the basis of which capitaliza-
tion occurs. Not to make allowance, in computing variations in pay
scales to determine the sums required to bring the fund up to par
with the entitlements accumulated in previous years, or with the in-
creases stemming from further economy-triggered raises, would be
tantamount in fact to lowering the overall total of the potential
growth in the severance pay fund and thereby reducing the sampling
level on the basis of which that increase is calculated. Since the
escalator also reflects the rise in the national inflation rate, the
criterion that prevailed prior to the advent of PL-9l brought about,
in practice, the pegging of the last recorded interest rate and tied
it directly in with the cost of living, which makes this practically
a unique case in the whole range of financing open to corporations.
The subsequent exclusion of the economic trigger-points has, on the
contrary, certainly changed if not altogether cancelled the indexing
criterion for that form of financing by pegging its repayment to the
ups and downs of the bargaining strength of the parties.

2. A Little Quantifying

In order to provide some practical underpinnings for the hypothesis
stated here and to evaluate its consequences, it is helpful to deter-
mine, if we can, the amount of financing that has flowed into cor-
porate coffers along this route and the cost curve for this kind of
resource. It is not an easy subject to analyze, in view of the
marked absence of hard data and, even were such data available, given
the extreme variability among the individual situations to which we
needs must refer. In the hope of essaying a satisfactory response to'
this need for data, we followed the criterion of preceding to evalua-
tions separated according to level: we lumped the whole industrial
sector of the economy together; we left out a large group of compa-
nies picked out from the list made available yearly by the Banca di

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR(ﬁFK1ALU$EONlY

Credito Finanziaria (Mediobanca); we separated out some major corpor-
ations active in several sectors of industry. From the whole corpus
of estimates were were able to arrive at in this way it is possible
to subsume the factors of distortion and of harmony, so as to arrive
at overall judgments and, perhaps, some suggestions.

a. Aggregate Level

For an assessment of the “aggregate" dimension of the phenomenon, the
national statistics offer a limited contribution. They are confined
to supplying "flow magnitudes," referring to annual set-asides and
payments, on the basis of which it is not practically feasible to
arrive at a satisfactory assessment of the overall dimensions of the
severance pay fund. Furthermore, there is no way to ascertain the
breakdowns of annual set-asides as between job compensation and up-
grading of previous compensation, while, finally, the national sta-
tistical estimates cover the entire rivate system (hence including
agriculture and the services as well with data gathered from big and
small businesses, most of them operating in the industrial processing
sector. Since between one area of production and the other there are
regulatory differences as well as differences in actual practices
(average seniority, average compensation, etc.), such an extrapola-
tion will perforce lead to results that are very largely approxima- .
tions.

We decided, therefore, to go ahead independently, without using the
data contained in the national statistics, with a new assessment based
on a narrower observed reality (covering only the industrial proces-
sing area), but at the same time analyzing it more completely and in
greater depth. It makes it possible to arrive at both the basic es-
timate and the annual set-aside in the two portions that constitute

it (job entitlement and increase of previous entitlement) and thus,

on the basis of the foregoing, at the calculation of the rate of in-
crease in the existing fund and, de facto, at the cost of these fi-
nancial resources.

The computations were based on the data in the General Report on the
National Economy, on actual findings released periodically by ISTAT,
and on data published by the EEC up te 1973. Where the data were in-
adequate we resorted to controlled estimates on narrower real bases
or to experience derived from actual cases. The methodological ap-
proach chosen involved finding the data and running the calculations
starting with the size of the labor force split into its three com-
ponents -- executives, office-workers, and in—plant workers -« as of
December of each year from 1970 to 1980. For each of the three cate-
gories of employees we found or estimated in some cases the data shown
in Table 1:

bonus) except family allotments;

the average number or fraction of monthly earnings payable for each
year of seniority.

With particular reference to the annual set-aside, we also found or
estimated:

the number or fraction of the monthly wage payable for the addi-
tional year of seniority: this is a marginal value, different from
the average value for the unskilled workers in many sectors and, as
of 1978, for executives (on the basis of the agreement of 18 July
1978, for every year of seniority completed since 31 January 1979 the
entitlement drops from 1.5 to 1 month's wages);

the rate of increase in individual compensation as compared with the
mean (this rate was used to quantify the updating of entitlement
reached in years prior to the date considered as a result of the im-
provements in the employees' position by comparison with the mean
due to increased seniority, transfers from one category to another,
merit raises, promotidns, etc.).

The payout for each year t was obtained by means of the difference
between the set-aside for the year t and the growth experienced by
the fund between the end of year T-l and the end of year t.

On the basis of these assumptions we determined the size of yearly
set-asides based on the job and for updating previously earned en-
titlement, the percentage rate of such updating, the total payout
and the size of the fund at year's end, using both the assumption of
real total count of the wage variations (hypothetical increase) and
that of ignoring the economic trigger-points so as to upgrade pre-

viously earned entitlement (actual upgrading). The results are shown
in Table 2.

The sum total of the complex of financing made available to the cor-
porate system through the severance pay mechanism for 1980 comes to
about 2 trillion lire. Had the trigger points not been ignored the
total of this sort of financing would have come close to 3.2 tril-
lion. It can be said that, by way of preliminary approximation

(the payouts were in fact underestimated because the only figures
available were those for actual payouts, meaning those calculated on
the basis of the “sterilized" contingency points) by comparison with
the 1975 year-end when there was no need to distinguish between the
hypothetical and the actual size of the fund, there was a growth
shortage of 96.9 percent.

Another observation has to do with the rate expressing the cost of
capital made available to companies, arrived at with approximate
reckoning on the basis of the ratio between the annual set-aside for
upgrading previous entitlement levels and the fund as it was at the
end of the preceding year. One can see at a glance that up to 1976
the rate showed particularly high values which would decline somewhat
although remaining at high levels in the subsequent years where the
fund was enlarged to keep pace with the overall increase in wage le-
vels. Vice versa, when the contingency points were sterilized after

January 1977, the size of the portion for upgrading previous entitle-
ment drops spectacularly, and along with it the money~cost rate which
expresses it, with a net advantage to the companies. You will note
as well, however, that the sharpest decline occurs in 1977, the year
immediately following the change in implementation of severance pay,
after which the rate turns upward again to reach a peak in 1979, the
yearlaborcontracts come up for negotiation.

Non-Aggregate Level: A Calculation Using Hediobanca Data

we may try to find confirmation for these initial conclusions by means
of a different "estimating'I procedure based on information found in
the report prepared by Hediobanca which, in 1980, covered a total of
924 businesses. This was a methodological approach which did not
reach out to the entire Italian economic system and contains its share
of approximations, made for the purpose of compensating for the lack
of solid data on a great many of the aspects under consideration.

Notwithstanding these shortcomings it can be helpful in providing an
overall picture of a decidedly broad segment of the Italian industrial
system, based on reliable, although not quite exhaustive sets of data.

It was deemed advisable to separate from the whole group of Mediobanca
companies those in the transport construction sector. These companies,
and most particularly FIAT, the bellwether company in that division,
were central figures in major operations modifying their structural
stance, particularly in the wake of mergers and divestments. ”his
might have made conclusions drawn from them particularly shaky and
potentially distorted, as for that matter we found from several early
experiments. The PIA! data will be taken into consideration, further-
more, at the next level of non-aggregation, which deals with indivi-
dual corporations.

For purposes of the preliminary processing needed here, the Medio-
banca data are insufficient, in that they relate the overall amount

of set-asides to the fund without making any distinction between the
amounts set aside each year on the basis of jobs and the amounts set
aside for upgrading previous entitlement. We therefore had to concen-
trate our major effort on performing this division operation with a
reasonable margin of safety. To do this we first proceded to estab-
lish the total labor costs recorded for purposes of determining the
severance pay, so as to arrive at something close enough to the total
of the annual wage-related set-aside. After that, by subtraction fros
the total set-aside as reported by Mediobanca in the total economic
cost, we preceded to estimate, with what we think is adequate approx-
imation, the amount of previous entitlement and the consequent level
of the rate at which the existing severance pay fund is added to.

We can say, summarily, that the amount of the annual set-aside to co-
ver previous entitlement is obtained by subtraction, reckoning the
amount of wage-based set-aside for each fiscal year and subtracting
it from the total set-aside. We arrived at the wage-based set-aside
figure by starting with the overall cost of labor and then, through

through a gradual process of elimination, arriving at a determination
of accountable compensation to define the annual quota for severance

pay a

The analytical process can be followed on Table 3. To make it more
readily understandable, we offer the following explanatory notes:

the social costs percentage (line D) was found through a process of
reading and comparing a great many corporate balance sheets from com-
panies, large and medium, which provide such information. That percen—
tage, which varies slightly from year to year, was used as a base for
reckoning the amount of social costs (line B) to be separated from
total labor costs in order to find the gross amount of compensation to
be entered as severance pay (line F);

the size of the frozen cost-of-living cushion (line G) we found by
counting c.o.1. points accumulated annually and cumulatively since
January 1977, then translating them into their actual monetary equiva-
lent, including the 13th-month bonus, taking into account the average
number of employees on the payroll over the course of each year at
each company studied. The calculations involved are shown below:

For all employees of the companies studied we had to establish the
average fraction of compensation (expressed in man't-hours)‘t on the ba-
sis of which we could determine the share of set-aside to the fund
(line I).

The basic hypothesis took 1.4 months' salary fron executives, 1 month
from white-collar employees, and a number of days/month for workers
which varied according to the sector to which they belonged. Since we
were using real data for Mediobanca's set-asides, which already inclu-
ded both holiday pay as well as the thirteenth-month bonus, we did
not have to estimate any compensatory additions for then. It was ne-
cessary, however, to pinpoint both the probable sectoral makeup of
Mediobanca corporations, as well as the probable structure of the la-
bor force employed by them in terms of executives, plant workers, and
white-collar workers. What we actually did was this:

Shares credited to :

Executives: 1.4 months’ base salary. In hours, this would
be h a 173 x 1.4 - 242 hours

Clerical: 1 month's base pay. In hours: 173

Plant workers: these will vary from sector to sector and ac-
to the worker's own seniority. The average num-
ber of hours for plant workers at Mediobanca
companies is derived from the assumption of
predominant presence of four typical sectors,

each with a different weight in terms of occu-
pation:

Metalworkers Food Industry Textiles Chemicals == Total
66 7.4 7.7 18.9 100

The average hours per month that can be witheld on the basis of con-

tracts and of average seniority assumed for Mediobanca were established
for set-aside:

0n the basis of these assumptions we performed a summary count of the
fraction of monthly earnings to be counted for the sample under obser-
vation.

To do this, we formulated a hypothesis as to the distribution of the
working population at Mediobanca for the major categories of workers
and at the same time we established the proportion within which pay-
scales could be set in relation to the different levels of employment.
For each year we performed the following counts on the basis of which
we found that, for all Mediobanca companies, the plausible fraction of
a month is about 25 days; it drops to 22 days when workers are assumed
to have worked a minimum of 90 hours.

The need to arrive at a convincing figure for the fund set-aside quota
on the basis of wage levels in effect at the end of each year led us
to find the rate reflecting the increase in the cost of labor at a
point about midway through each year.

The per capita cwst of labor derived from the Mediobanca data refers

to the total of pay received over the entire year, and therefore can

be used as the basis [or a rough estimate of the average earnings at

midyear, or, if you will, as of 30 June. Since that per capita labor
cost is used to figure,the wage-based set-aside quota, it seems wise

to try harder for a tighter fix on it, using for the purpose earnings
accruing between 30 June and 31 December of each year.

This was done by finding the arithmetical mean between the per capita
labor cost for 2 successive years referred as we said to 30 June, and
thus arriving at what is probably a reliable figure for the 31 Decem-
ber that falls between them. The increment in this datum with respect
to per capita labor cost for the previous 30 June gives us the per-
centage shown on line N. It is used as the basis for calculating the
datum on line 0.

The total of the severance pay fund (line Q) is derived directly from
the data given in the Mediobanca publication, most particularly from
the cumulative holdings statement. It was used to calculate the cost
rate of this type of financing. To this end, however, we had to take
into account the fact that the sum of money actually available to the
company is known only approximately. It can in fact be argued that

it is represented by the fund existing as of the close of the year

for which we calculate additions to it apart from the year's set-asides
(line R): in this case it is underestimated since the resulting fig-
ure is net, without the payouts made and falling due in that year.
These occur gradually and are included in the overall yearly set-aside.
The fund at year's end, however, is net, not including the fractions
of quotas set aside and paid out to those who have left the company.
Subtracting from the fund all yearly set-asides and hence such frac-
tions as well means that you will wind up with an estimate that is too
low. Since the fund is the denominator in the ratio that expresses
the cost of capital, that cost is implicitly raised. That effect can
be avoided by assuming the value of the fund as of the end of the pre-
vious year. In this case, again, you get a too-high estimate and a
subsequent undue lowering of the measurement of the cost of money ob-
tained in this way, since the fund winds up including the sum owed to
those who have quit the company in that fiscal year.

Bearing in mind the points made thus far, the reader may consider
Table 3, on which we show the amount of wage-based set-asides, those
for upgrading previous entitlements and for the severance pay fund for
the years from 1974 to 1979.

On the basis of these data and others calculated in the same way but
using the hypothesis of a mean fraction of earnings accumulatable as

22 days instead of 25, we established various configurations of the
cost of capital obtained through the severance pay system shown in
Table 4, integrated with the annual rates of increase in the per capita
cost of labor or expressing some configurations of the cost of money

in Italy taken from the Bank of Italy Report or derived from it.

In the first pl~ce thev confirm the behavior already observed at the
general level, whatev=r assumption is taken with regard to the frac-
tion of monthly earnings to be counted in determining the set-asides.
Since 1977 we note a clear decline in the cost of financing companies
obtain thrOugh the severance pay system. This is not, however, a de-
cline destined to last, since in 1978 there is another upturn which
will peak in 1979: it is quite likely that when contracts are renego-
tiated there will be a "de facto recovery" of what had been lost by
sterilization of the cost-of-living trigger points for counting pur-
poses in settlements. In 1979 the phenomenon occurs with particular
clarity because when the new contracts were negotiated there was a
change, in favor of the workers, in the fractions of months to be
counted in the definition of the value of the point. Though nothing
has been decided as yet on this score it is likely that, given the
sharp rise in cost-of—living points as a result of the current rate of
inflation, in future rounds of contract bargaining some portion of the

trigger-points passed since January 1977 may wind up in the pay en-
velope: in that event the cost rates of this type of financing would
simply take off. If for no other reason, the phenomenon should occur
simply in response to the rise in wage levels. On the methodological
level the obvious consequence would be, in order to arrive at a correct
assessment of the cost of such financing and, along with it, the re-
turn for those who provided it, the best bet would be a mean of the
rate values for the entire period between one round of collective
bargaining and the next. On the likely assumption that the true cost
of this type of financing will be somewhere within those shown in
Table 4 and that it can be approximated by an arithmetical mean of the
four values shown here for each year, we should see the following
pattern:

Translated into graphic form (Figure 1) these clearly confirm the
performance described.

With respect to the data to be obtained by examining data referring
to the entire economic system, those having to do with the Mediobanca
group alone, particularly for 1977, 1978, and 1979, seem to be visi-
bly higher in the quantitative dimension.

Generally speaking, it would be well to emphasize the fact that this
is a group of companies that can be described as "large" or at least
"medium," even given the uncertainty of available dimensional para-
meters to quantify them. In relation to the sum total, which will
obviously include smaller companies as well, the mean earnings levels
in Mediobanca companies will assuredly be higher. This is an asser-
tion based on the greater impact of organized labor activity and on
the practical impossibility of getting away from the many aspects of
the regulatory restrictions on labor in a large company, or from the
qualitative composition of the employee group which, again for a big
company, generally shows a markedly higher proportion than the mean
for executives and clerical staff. Because of this situation the an-
nual wage-based set-asides and the upgrading of previously earned en-
titlomcnt are particularly high.

(1) This percentage was deduced by correcting the SPF as denominator
in the ratio for the effect of the many workers leaving Olivetti. In
this year (1979) the phenomenon was so massive as to distort the cal-
culations of the cost of financing. We proceded more or less this way:

Somewhere along the .Line you must also take into account the average
age which is generally older in big companies and, as a consequence,
the probable presence of employees who have worked for their organi-
zation for lonL periods; a sector-specific makeup that is different
with greater incidencr of those areas of industry (metalworking, steel,

chemicals) in which workers as a whole enjoy higher levels of enti-
tlement for purposes of computing their severance pay.

Some perplexity may arise in connection with the data for the years
1974, 1975, and 1976 in which. accordinz to which series you consider,
you sometimes find a totally reversed_situation: the bottom line for
1975, for instance, is lower for all the Mediobanca data. From the
methodological point of view it would seem advisable to emphasize the
fact that the calculating method can exert that kind of influence:
since they are obtained by subtraction from the total set-asides, the
shares for increasing previously earned entitlement come out smaller
the higher the fraction of qualifying earnings chosen to determine

21

the earnings-based shares. In the case of the Mediobanca data the
phenomenon is markedly more evident when you take it as 22 days. One
might hazard the notion that by adopting 22 days (which is not really
arguable in this group of companies for the reasons set forth earlier)
these discrepancies practically cancel one another out.

Probably this arithmetical effect can distort the conclusions only for
the first part of the period considered, since in the second part the

results of our work with the Mediobanca data come out higher in any
case.

c. The Non-Aggregate Level: Cases of Individual Companies

As part of our acquisition of data on the nicroeconomic scale we deci-
ded to consider the cases of several major companies which agreed to
provide us with their data on the whole area of set-asides for the
severance pay system. From then we derived some specific observations
of detail, which are very sound from the point of view of precision.

They provide substantial confirmation of the data for the Mediobanca
group, and are therefore helpful to analyze. In addition to this con-
firmation which can offer, among other things, grounds for confidence
as to the validity of the methodological approach taken, it seems im-
portant to call attention to the FIAT data for 1980. It actually de-
clines following contract renewal in 1979 and clearly reveals the new
drop in the cost of financing through managmaent of the severance pay
system when increases following passage of trigger points are not
computed for severance pay purposes.

3. Concluding Remarks

The quantitative elements gathered enable us to find some points of
departure for a reexamination of the problem we began with for this
article, having to do with the advisability of reconsidering, and if

so in what terms, the decision to drop free the computation of restora-
tion of the severance pay fund of the entitlement variations pegged

to rises in the cost of living index.

A return to the initial positions does not seem feasible: militating
against it is the otherwise too sharp increase in labor costs, to

offset which and to ward off its consequences PL 91 was drafted in
the first place. No less cogent an argument for not agreeing to go
back to the original system can be drawn, however, from consideration
of the genuine nature of financing from the severance pay fund. In

the years just prior to 1977 that form of loan was not only the sole
form to benefit by full indexation to the cost of living, but to en-
joy 3 level of return well above that afforded by the conventional

22

patterns of the use of savings. The data in Table 4 and the patterns
in Figure 1 make it clear that, no matter how you figure it, the an-
nual cost of money lent to companies through the /forced loan/ of
monies from the severance pay fund is far higher than either the aver-
age interest rates for bank investments in non-financial companies

or the mean actual yield on bonds, as shown in the Bank of Italy's
reports. The worker's lack of access to those financial resources
until such time as he left the company was thus more than amply com-
pensated by the actual rates their capitalization reached.

It can be said just as confidently that after January 1977 the finan-
cial relationship was certainly no less fair for opposite reasons.

The rate at which repayment of the money thus obtained is made by

the companies, although corrected by the jumps it displays when labor
contracts are negotiated and in any case in relation to wage increases,
is far below the normal rates for repayment of borrowed money.

Once again, a look at Table 4 and Figure l is a helpful supporting
element for this consideration: in the specific conditions of the
years subsequent to 1977 in Italy the fully informed worker with free-
dom to choose would certainly not have agreed to lend the corpora-
tions the sums that were his by law just because of the regulations
governing the severance pay system. For the companies, though, that
loan was exceedingly advantageous, since they found that they could
get money at a cost well below the going rate on the money market.

The proper objective of restoring equity to this steadily deteriorat-
ing relationship can find some objective elements to work with by
considering its nature as financing for the corporations by the work-
ers. Since this, in the final analysis, is what we are talking about,
it would seem prudent to compare the cost of capital obtained in this
way with some still undefined measurement which must be pegged to the
going cost of loans on the money market, or at least to some fair ap-
proximation of it. The /forced/ nature of the loan might also sug-
gest some corrective measures, particularly to take cognizanco of the
level of risk which financing for the company might display by compa-
rison with comsletely reliable investments, and in the direction of
some indexing system 'hat would protect its purchasing power over the
years. At the root of this kind of proposal lies the conviction that,
once it has gone to swell the severance pay fund, the set-aside is no
longer subject to the regulations governing a work relationship, but
becomes a financial relationship, and a fundamental conviction, fur-
thermore, as to the objectivity of a relationship with features like
these. What is suggested here may help to restore a climate of grea-
ter serenity to a situation which, given current conditions and per-
sistence of current rates of inflation, will inevitably tend to dete-
riorate to the detriment of the workers and, most particularly, of

23

the weakest among them. A goal to be pursued', particularly in the
short or at most the medium term, and which should not interfere with
studying and working with a view to the total abolition of the archaic
form of insurance that is the severance pay system, which is today an
anachronism in all industrialized and socially advanced countries.

FOOTNOTES

1. The content of this study takes it for granted that the reader
will be familiar with the way the severance pay fund works. for those

who may not be so, we sum up herewith the main characteristics of the
system.

For every year of work for the company or agency, severance pay is com-
mensurate with a share of the latest monthly paycheck, which may vary
from category to category (plant workers, office employees, executives)
and from sector to sector. Particularly with reference to plant work-
ers, the quotas may change from time to time according to collective
bargaining contract stipulations, but almost invariably the change af-
fects seniority accruing after such stipulation, leaving previous re-
gulations in effect for entitlement accumulated prior to the latest
agreement. In a good many contracts, provision is also made for lev-
els of severance pay to be pegged to the worker's seniority.

Having said that, we can state that the accumulation, year after year,
of increasing severance pay entitlement constitutes the so-called sev-
erance pay fund carried on company books as a liability. That fund
grows each year as new quotas come due. Since it must, by law, be
commensurate with the level of the latest wages paid, it also increases
in response to the variations that may have occurred in that level,
multiplied (to the extent stipulated in the contract) by the number of
years of seniority of company employees. The dimensions of that growth
will be affected by the removal of the cost-of—living trigger-points
we are discussing in this study. The fund is diminished each year as
severance settlements are made to those who, for whatever reason, cease
to work for the company which has employed them.

More analysis in depth of the way the severance fund system operates
can be found in the following sources:

Operaie, Rome, 1977.

We also suggest consulting the legislation governing severance pay, from
DLL 1112 of 9 February 1919 to P1. 604 of 15 July 1966 and DL 12 of
7 February.

The content of the aggregate level analysis is the topic of a re-
port to appear shortly: "Severance pay. Economic and financial
aspects and proposals for reform," by 0. Castellino and G. Zan-

etti. Some excerpts from it appear in this study on aspects
deemed important.

We would remind readers once again of the complexity of the task
of estimating the fraction of wages to be set aside to constitute
or restore the severance pay fund. The share for executives has
in fact been reduced from 1.5 month's salary for each year up to
31 January 1979 to 1 month's salary for succeeding seniority en-
titlement.

For plant workers the situation is extremely variable, since their
positions may be widely disparate, and require singling out at

the individual level. In the Mediobanca instance we therefore

had to try an interpretive hypothesis in terms of distribution

by category, by sector, and by differences in pay scales.

PSF SECRETARIAT MEMBER W PCP. EUROPEAN REACTION T0 POLAND
P11161603 Paris LE NOUVEL osssnvartun in French 9-15 Jan 82 p 29

[Interview with P5 National Secretariat Mar Jean Poperen by Franz-Olivier
Gieshert: "Is the PCP Playing at Europe's Pinlandiaation7"-date and place not
given]

[Text] LE NOUVBL OBSERVATBUR: Eyery day L'EUHANITB paints the Harssw generals
in a favorable light. Is the French Connunists' support for the repression not
in a way unprecedented?

Jean Poperen: Not entirely, since they approved of the crushing of the people's
uprising in Budapest in 1956. But in the historical perspective it is true that
what is happening now is more serious. This is because we have had meanwhile the
fairly clear "disapproval" of the Prague coup in 1968. The PCP'a present support
for the Polish coup is. therefore, a regression. It can obviously be described
as an ideological and political regression.

LE NOUVEL OBSERVATBUR: How do you explain that?

Jean Poperen: For the past few years the PCP has gone back on the-“cautioua—bold
moves of waldeck Rochet's era. Now in the policy of the columnists at the end of
the sixties and beginning of the seventies the search for a real agreement with the
socialists went hand in hand with greater autonomy of behavior with regard to the
USSR. In my view the two approaches were indissoluhly linked. And, moreover.
they were simultaneously crlled into question. Reservations on the union policy
emerged at the same time a: the desire to stop differing from the USSR on the
essential issues. There is reason to wonder what the columnists are doing in
following that line because at the very tine what the workers in Poland are
suffering repression it is obvious that the strategy of regression is totally
disastrous on the political or electoral level.

1.2 NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR: Why then was that strategy adopted?

Jean Poperen: You have to wonder whether the only justification for such a policy
would ultimately be the idea that, in one way or another, a series of shifts will
eventually give the USSR an increasingly dosinsnt position in Europe and that the

latter will finally topple. That is a major question. We can no longer avoid
asking it.

LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR: Some people are asking it in the COT. which is at present
in the throes of a great debate. what do you think of the threats made by Henri
Krasucki against the socialists, who are accused of interference?

Jean Poperen: They merely inspire great serenity in me. we have received many
threats over recent years and frankly we are none the worse for them. It is
from the ccr's viewpoint that this affair is worrying. It worries me that a
leader should reject the debate developing within his organization in this way.
But that is the COT trade unionists' business.

LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR: Is it not worrying that the majority parties should be
in disagreement on such a serious problem as that of Poland?

Jean Poperen: There was complete solidarity within the government on this question.
It seems fairly clear to me that this tragedy challenges a component of the
majority. in this case the PCP. And the PCP will obviously have to explain such

an attitude toward the first great workers revolution since the [Paris] commune

[of 1789-1795].

LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR: Hitherto the PS has always been extremely cautious about--.
its analysis of the USSR. whose leaders were, moreover, invited to the Valence
Congress last year. What have you learned from the Polish tragedy?

Jean Poperen: First, it is a great first in the history of the communist movement:
The army has been forced to take control of the country because the party was
incapable of playing the role given to it in that type of society. It is important
to understand that the party and state bureaucracy has gradually destroyed any
real political life: But today that decline is working against it. It is now
having to step down in favor of the only force in the system which is still
standing. namely, military power. We have come full circle: The revolutionary
movement which was born in 1917 has ended up yielding power, or, to be more
precise. full powers to a handful of generals.

LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR: Do you mean that you believe in a kind of militarization
of the USSR, as Cornelius Castoriedis does (note: author of "In Pace of Her")?

Jean Poperen: The ruling gerontocracy in Moscow is the last generation of those
who were descendants of the revolutionary movement. And my feeling is that when
the moment of truth comes in Moscow too the CPSU is likely to be seen as a
politically and ideologically empty structure. It will therefore be the vital
forces of the Soviet superstructure-end primarily the army-which will naturally
have to play a leading role. If such a phenomenon were to be seen in the USSR.
which I fear will be the case, it is clear that it would concern the whole world.
That danger is no longer irrelevant. But it is not the only danger. The danger
of the process known as Finlandization is not negligible.

LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR: Do you mean that Europe is already paralyzed by Soviet
power?

Jean Poperen: No. But if you consider the worrying behavior of some European
governments regarding the Polish portent, you cannot help wondering about possible

27

ulterior motives. Permit me to recall that in a pamphlet--"81: Changing Power"--
written in 1980 I motioned the hypothesis of a deal between the USSR and the PRC:
Unification in exchange for neutralization. That would clearly mean Germany's

Finlandization. He can see how that hypothesis now deserves to be taken seriously.

LE NOWEL OBSERVATEUR: What do you propose in face of these threats?

Jean Poperen: The Polish crisis will have been s serious warning shot. It also
shows us how to face the fact. It is only by European cohesion that we will be
able to confront the danger. This cohesion is a more pressing political necessity
than ever. And it seems to me that it involves obligations for all those in Europe
who are aware of the facts. The French socialists are less alone in this affair
than has been said. On our initiative the socialist international did react on
Poland. It is true that it did so after highly dubious statements by some

SPD leaders.... A political 'and ideological struggle is now necessary if we are
not to resign ourselves to seeing a part of Europe slide into a neutralism which
would be harmful for peace. But I an optimistic. The Polish tragedy has had s
widespread influence on the European collective consciousness. Look at the PCI:
Its stances show that the Italian Commists are drawing all the appropriate
conclusions from what has happened. He will probably have to consider initiatives,
with it and also with other organizations, which will pave the way for a new
internationalian.

LE NOUVZL OBSERVATEUR: Aside from the ideological struggle, what do you advocate?
Jean Poperen: It is clear that the question of sanctions must now be considered.
In any case the question of trade with the East can now be no longer regarded

in the same way as before.

LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR: Would you be in favor of a European military force?

Jean Poperen: In view of the new situation which has been created the West's
military structures will, of course, have to be reappraised. 1111s is a question
which cannot be avoided for long. It is true that Europe, as such, must start
thinking about its own future.
