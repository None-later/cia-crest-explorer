[Interview with Gerard Game (061‘) by 1.! ram: ”lights Which Go in the
Right Direction“; date and place not specified]

[Text] Gerard Gauss, 37. a socialist and a somber of the confederal .buraeu
of the 061‘ answers 1.! Pom-1's questions on the proposed Autos: law.

1.3 POINT: Won't the new workers' rights be nainly new rights for trade unions?

Gerard Gems: It is a mistake to contrast trade union rights and workers'
rights. Because who. if not organized labor. has the means to make sure the
rights of the workers are respected? When we speak of strengthening trade
union rights that does not mean strengthening the organisation itself, but
rather placing it in the service of the workers.

[Question] Just the same. Does the cor se- to be turning up its nose at
these proposals?

[Answer] No. On the whole they so in the right direction. They constitute
a real step forward. They also call for other major steps. For example.
the nonthly trade union information hour for wage earners. It has just been
adopted for state employees. It ought to be the rule everywhere. He also
want to abolish interior rules at the workplace. because they are a weapon
allowing the nost couplets arbitrariness on the part of meant. He had
also hoped for the creation of trade union locals operating in more than one
workplace. Actually. in mall and ﬁddle-sired businesses and industries.
the lower limit of 50 workers very often prohibits the creation of a trade
union local with full rights. In our opinion, it is not acceptable that

5 or 6 million workers era in this way completely deprived of trade union

representation.

1:, [Question] You are calling for freedom of speech on political nattere at the
work place. Is it really up to a trade union to propose such a right?

E [Answer] We are merely adopting the stand of the prime minister on the "new
33; citizenship." All the rights and freedoes which accompany citizenship rust be

able to be exercised at the workplace. This means, of course. a certain
nunber of rules. but free speech on political matters is part. in our opinion,
of the whole range of basic freedoaa.

[Question] Doesn't all that justify the fears of turning the workplace into
a permanent forum?

[Answer] 0n the contrary. we even believe that the worker's right to free
speech is necessary in today's econony. Some people in manage-ant have
understood this very well. But they use the workers' right to free speech
only for the purpose of improving efficiency. Be, on the other hand. went
workers to speak out on all the problems they are facing: on working
.conditions or the introduction of new techniques, but also in case of econonic
problems in the workplace. That is why, for era-ple, we are calling for a
right to suspensive appeal for the workplace con-ittee in the latter of
dismissals.

[Question] You mean veto power?

[Answer] Not at all. The COT, contrary to what we are told. has never
asked for veto power, which night lead to a situation of blockage. He only
want. instead of unilateral and irrevocable decisions, to allow the search
for better solutions. For us. economic progress and social progress are not
in opposition. but they strengthen each other and influence each other.

ROLE. GOALS 0F NAIIONALIZAIION IN RANK. SAVINGS REFOII
Paris L'EXPRBSS in French 16-22 Apr 82 pp 78-83
[Article by Agnes Rebattet: "Investments: what ls Going To Change")

[Text] After decentralization, audiovisuals. and the work week, it is
savings' turn to be the object of government concern. The socialist govern-
ment wants to completely rechsnnel the 600 billion francs put aside by house-
holds every year. According to a L'EXPRESS-FUELlﬂlTklE-ACTUALITBS survey.
six out of every ten Frenchmen will be affected by this reform.

Jacques Delors. minister of economy end finaace, has asked an expert committee,
chaired by David Dautresme, president of Crecit du hard. to submit proposals
to him. There are two priorities: promote long-term savings. to be used

for sounder financing of the economy and the budget deficit; and. redistribute
to the less fortunate the government tax credits for severe. This is a real
puzzler: obviously it is the_wealthier French people who contribute the most
to savings. They might reduce their savings if they are going to be penalized.
Prospects of a great political debate! In tinkering with savings, the govern-
ment is running up against well-rooted habits and is jeopardizing the advan-
tages to be obtained. The elimination of anonymity in gold transactions,

the new regulations governing time-deposit accounts. and the possibility of
taxing works of art have all been stormy 1 sues since the Left took power.

It will be no different with the new measures. Rene Honory, former minister
of Seuuuuy, has already taken up the banner, through the Defense-Savings
Association (40, 000 members). and has labeled the socialist government's
philosophy "inquisitorial."

Francois Mitterrand, during his presidential campaign. pledged to protect the
savings of moderate-income families against inflation. This has been done.
The National Assembly has just agreed to create a People' a Sevitgs Booklet
(LB?) indexed on inflation. Under this measure. ll million housnholds. those
who pay less than 1.000 francs in taxes each year. can protect their savings-
albeit modestly. since the ceiling is limited to 10,000 frencs--egainst mone-
tary erosion. provided they do not touch these savings for 6 months.

To this "pink" booklet revolutionary? It is more of a token gesture. "hat
do these 30 billion francs--according to the moat optimieitc estimates-
that the banking system could thus collect actually represent? Barely 6
percent of the gigantic sums invested on the A booklets of the savings banks.

IOI<OUIICIAI.IIIIIIULY
I'D“ Ul‘ﬂtul. USE ONLY

After the appetizers comes the main course: the Dautreame report to be
submitted to Jacques Delors and Laurent Pabius. minister of the budget this
weekend. This document will not be made public before the end of the month,
which gives the ministers tine to digest its 200 pages.

It has taken 6 months of meetings, with three sessions a week, not counting
the working weekends. for these "experts" to measure the impact of possible
changes and to work out, in order, all the advantages and catastrophes that
any change in taxes on investments could trigger. After the first noble
flights of fancy, the encounter with reality was particularly painful. "You
cannot imagine how many tiring and stormy technical meetings we have had."
reported a member of the cosmdttee. Most of the major tension actually arose
from technical aspects.

Should we or should we not abolish the anonymity of bonds? Treasury bills

and bonds of savings banks and Credit agricole account for nearly 200 billion
francs. They are anonymous, with 5-year maturities, and enjoy a 62-percent
tax deduction [prelevement fiscal liberatoire]. who are their privileged
customers? Merchants, small shop owners and farmers. income brackets that

are frequently opaque for the tax authorities. A praiseworthy effort to raise
morale, but who is going to profit from it? Elimination of anonymity in

gold transactions decided in October 1981 has already caused capital flights.
All the same. the yellow metal can be stored indefinitely. What will happen
to the money recovered when the bonds mature? Will it be stashed away in cash?
Will it be spent or invested elsewhere? The reform of the time-deposit system,
which has affected the trifling amount of 100 billion francs, shows that it

is impossible to make predictions. It would be better to increase taxes on
anonymous investments than to eliminate them. the specialists maintain.

A Gigantic Plumbing System

The second item of controversy among the experts is the possibility of replac-
ing tax exemption based on the type of investment by deductions computed on

the basis of income. According to the EXPRESS-PULIHBTRIE survey, 40 percent

of savers are opposed to a measure of this sort. Nevertheless, a certain
number of tax incentives have been diverted from their purpose over the years.
Since 1950, hundreds of thousands of prosperous merchants, physicians, attorneys
and business executives have, for instance. made excellent real estate deals--
either by buying their homes for the price of rent, or by purchasing apart-
ments as investments. The rental income has repaid their loans, the Treasury
has paid interest to boot, in the form of a tax deduction, and, finally. mone-
tary erosion has assured cosicrtable profits. A questionable system: the
wealthier one is. the easier it is to borrow, and the more one borrows, the
richer one becomes. Moreover. the circle is completed with the rise in credit
rates and in real estate prices (see Marie-Laure de Leotard's article).

The Dautresme committee quickly realized that one thing was essential: "we
must be sure that we do not break the pipes of savings, this gigantic plumbing
system where leaks are particularly difficult to stop," one of the participants
in the committee acknowledged. There is nothing fiercer, more fleeting.

or more easily traumatized than a saver.

"You will remember how horrible the liabilities were that the generations
following Horld War I pessed on to their heirs, after the Russian loans or

the Panama Canal bonds collapsed," a stock broker recounted. So be cautious!
The stench Government once again is confronted with the same needs and the
same difficulties as its predecessors. "here is it going to find the money
and how can it get its hands on it? Hunting down money has become an increas-
ingly difficult task. The French people are no longsr-unfortunately-"the
Japanese are savings." A l-percent variation in the savings rate represents
more or less 20 billion francs. The savings rate declined from 18 to 25 per-
cent between 1974 and 1981. For the past year, 30 percent of households have
pared their savings. according to the L‘EXPRBSS—PUBLIHBTRIE survey. There are
two reasons for this.

--The purchasing power. Because of the unemployment crisis, it has grown only
slightly or is stagnant. So to maintain their consumption patterns, many
families would rather "draw" on their savings.

-The flight from money. Anticipating price increases, individuals are step-
ping up their buying, even though it means getting further into debt than
usual. This explains to a great extent the predilection of the French toward
"disposable” or liquid savings.

Forty-four million French people have the famous "A" savings booklet from
Ecureuil or the P.T.T., and 6 million have the "blue" booklet from credit
mutuel. These three networks were handling more than 570 billion francs, or
38 percent of French savings, as of 31 December 1981. The preference for
cash holdings is‘only increasing: one out of two French people questioned by
PUBLIHETRIE stated that preference today.

The savings banks, which are the great beneficiaries of this movement, are
not rejoicing. They are worried about the effect of the pink booklet on the
"A" booklet and are afraid that the letter will eventually disappear.

In fact. the report on "banking reform" submitted by Jean-Michel Bloch-Laine
to Jacques Delors in the beginning of March recommends that the amounts
deposited on the "A" booklet be frozen at their current level (49,600 francs).
This is tantamount to condemning it to a slow death, because of monetary ero-
sion. According to the Socialists, if an 8.5 percent interest rate net of
taxes is not enough for a saver whose "A" booklet represents his only savings,
it is for too much for "well-off" citizens who use the booklets as remunera-
tive bank accounts. Unfortunately, this line of reasoning runs up against

a sizesble, technical obstacle, namely that the resources collected by the
"A" booklet are channeled through the Deposit and Consignment Office, which
uses them to inexpensively finance local governments and low-cost housing.
They also have ardent defenders. Thus Francois Hitterrsnd cautiously assured:
”The existence of the "A" booklet will not be jeopardized." In saying this,
he contradicted his Economy Minister. Jacques Delors, who had to make amends:
"I never intended to condemn the "A" booklet to euthanasia," he told the
National Assembly on 6 April.

Bloch-Laine wanted to redirect a good part of the billions of francs invested
at very short term toward longer-term, but better protected investments. He
did not count on psychological obstacles. Hhatever the investments that make

PUK UH'KJAL USE ONLY

up the galaxy of savings, the "A“ booklet remains the center pin. It
accompanies the Frenchmen from birth to death. Parents deposit the first

token franc in the child's booklet. This is the beginning of the process of
accumulating wealth. "hen the nest egg becomes siseable, the Frenchman will
try to buy a home, and when his basic needs have been met, at about the age

of 50, he will begin to think about financial savings. These savings, includ-
ing stocks, bonds and other common investment paper, account for only 6 percent
of total savings. "It would be stupid to disregard this basic motivation.

It would be better to use it to maintain and possibly increase households'

savings," an eVpert from the Savings Research and Study Center (082?)
commented.

The Dautresme committee wants to promote the bond market. Nationalizations
have already changed shareholders into holders of liabilities (subject to
compensation). The exchange began on 13 April. "It is therefore out of the
question to try to change the current financial system, which is very favor-
able," an exchange broker explained. It seems instead that the government is
trying to encourage a movement: investments in bonds have doubled in the
past 3 years, a result of interest rate trends. In January 1980, government
bonds issued at 12 percent were called historic. Since then, interest rates
have taken off, and bonds have exceeded 16 or even 17 percent, with the result
that business executives, administrative personnel, and prosperous indepen-
dents (including members of the professions and merchants) have been seduced
by the high return-without seeing that the constant rise of interest rates
was devaluating their capital. Nearly 5 pertant of households currently
hold bonds, and the figure will be about 7 percent by 1984. New types of
variable rate securities indexed on the money market or on the rate of new
issues now protect them against bad surprises. A 17 percent return, accom-a
panied by tax incentives, yields 12 to 13 percent net of taxes (a 3,000
franc interest deduction on the income tax return, and a prelevement libera-
toire [standsrd7] deduction of up to 25 percent). "If banks were to make a
reasonable effort to inform the public, there would be a new clientele of
savers interested in bonds," according to a stock exchange source. A
considerable potential market.

A new product, "the retirement savings account," could also make capital roll
in. This account would make it possible to invest long-term capital, an ideal
supplement to a retirment which is regarded by many as very uncertain. This
should be particularly popular among executives and middle~management staff,
who are very worried about the future of their retirement systems. The
rapporteur of the Dautresme committee, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, an economics
professor at Parix-X Nanterre. has Just published a book on the subject of
"Savings and Retirement." It would appear that his conclusions have been
followed. It is obviously out of the question for the government to guarantee
purchasing power during a time of rising interest rates. This would be
disastrous for the entire country. But it can protect retirement capital

more effectively than the present arrangements. Life insurance programs in
fact have two major disadvantages.

--Taxes and charges of insurance companies considerable reduce the rates
offered.

IKMR1OIINCIAI.IEHE(HULY
liﬂl(lﬂﬂ(JAl.USB¢MNLY

-Financisl mechanisms, such as redistributed profits and indexing on the
AGIRC points. cannot make up for the impact of monetary erosion.

A Big Unknown

Streuss-Kahn advocates two stages: the first would be s relatively long period
of savings managed by bankers, who are consiered better able to obtain return
on capital; and, the second stage, involving payment of an annuity, would

be the responsibility of the insurers.

All governments have dreamed of reforming savings for a long time. These
dreams have been reflected in the creation of many committees and the publica-
tion of dozens of reports. in the good French tradition. This provides a great
opportunity each time for pressure groups, bankers, real estate promoters and
other agents of change to doggedly defend their interests. The result is

that instead of being selective. tax incentives have been accumulated. There-
fore, attempts to rechannel household savings, such as Rene honory's idea to
channel them toward high-risk investments (stocks). have been semivictorioue.
This time the government has a solid trump card: with the nationalization of
the banking sector. it has a firm grip on the reins of the savings network.
Will it succeed here where others have failed?

Everything will depend on a big unknown: the reform of the entire financial

system scheduled for next fall. And. to be sure. the rate of increase in
prices.

[interview with Michel Rocard, minister of state for economic planning and

devel t, by Frans-Olivier Giesbert: What I Lack"; date and place not
givego

ﬁesf’ Before presenting his reforms to the National Assen-

bly, the minister for planning explains why more than laws
is needed to bring real change to a country.

[Q-uestioj We have heard practically nothing from you since May 10. Are
you that happy in your closet?

[inner] I an working to get French planning underway again. That is'a big
job. Where is the closet?

@uesticg It is your ministry. Not everyone in the government is your
friend. Have you not, in the end, done a disservice to the plan by taking
charge of it?

[Knievel-7 That question should be asked of others. In this country. the
problem with the plan is the political authority‘for it. In 35 years of
planning it has not been possible to solve it. But degeneration of the

plan could well be explained in a pricd of «pension. Not so now. In
hence we really plan only in tins 'of crisis, and the crisis is here.

@uesticg? Everyone talks of rigor these days. You should be happy. Are
we moving. despite denials. toward a Barreisn of the left?

[Kneweg Barreisn is of the right by definition. That doctrine neglects
individuals by focusing solely on a body of abstract figures. nut being
said, it is true that methods of magenent must be redefined more strict-

ly: first, because the internatimal crisfs’ isrnorsening ...
@uestiog? You are not telling us you are Just now discovering that!

P03 OFFICIAL 083 ONLY
POI MICIAL m OIL?

[Knewej Not me. Some few, here and there, may have taken longer than no.
cessary to realize that the world is in crisis. A part of the left had
fallen behind in that respect. But I think the last eyes are opening.
That is why the time see-s to have cone for socialist rigor, that is, for
balance between economic lucidity and social ieegination.

ﬁnestiog? In starting to preach it, is not the P8 by way of becoming Ro-
car'lian, as was said by Olmde'Evin, chairman of the social affairs comit-

tee of the National Assembly?

ﬁnsweg? Concerning rigor, my problem is that action should follow words.
This country will get sick from paying more attmtion than to action. For
us, politics is what is done, not want is said.

ﬁnestiog You are liked or disliked, but you are generally considered one
of the left's best experts. Frankly, then, do you approve the government's
economic policy? '

[A-nsweg We are searching for tools that will enable us to get out of the
crisis, and they will not be found in our classics, for economic science

is silent on that. That is why we have a duty to be imaginative—and at
times I wonder if we are not a bit short of that quality. When he launched

the New Deal in the United States, President Roosevelt broke with the whole
economic intelligentsia of his time. That was in 1932. Four years later

appeared a book by a certain John Maynard Keynes: 'General Theory of Inter-
est, Employment, and Honey." He gave coherent statement to what Roosevelt,
with great pragmtism, had attempted with success. "The only thing we have
to fear," said Roosevelt, "is fear itself." I all not afraid. If we run a
risk, in fact, it is that the necessary preservation of our under financial
balances may cut off our chances of growth. In time, a currency always ul-
timately reflects the productivity of the economy which issues it.

[Questiog Host indicators are bad today. Is not the economy taking its
revenge?

gamer? hon the first, our priority has been to combat uneaployment. It
means personal suffering for the jobless, and also a loss of substance for
the national comnity. To 'cheok it, we wished to apply two measures: first,
a better distribution of work. But French society showed us that its whole
life was based on personal or corporate egoisn. It put defense of the pur-
chasing power of wage earners before solidarity with those who have no job.
Vhence the limited results of the courageous policy of working hours reduc-
tion;

The second neamre: growth, the creator of jobs. It is naturally difficult
to have growth at a time when all our partners are in recession. That was
bound to cause imbalances. He knew, for example, that it would be our bal-
ance of paynents which would begin to pay the bill for growth. It was me-
chanical, inevitable. To prevent a falling-off of foreign trade, it was

thus necessary to reconquer the domestic market, while economizing on im-
ported energy.

@uestiog But the government has obstructed energy eomomies.

[Knswej The effort does not in fact match the provisions of the interim
plan developed by the government last year.‘

@uestion? Does that not prove that the plan really counts for little?

[insweg The two-year interim plan was written very quickly, when industrial
policy was not yet defined. And we are only just beginning to carry it out.
But it is true that the plan is first of all a matter of determination. I
find that in the importance the two great majority parties have always at-
tached to planning. In 1977 I even reminded the P8 that the whet retains
a regulatory role. I was, in a word, a lucid planner. I have renined so.
And yet it is not always easy, today, to do as each as I would like ...

[Questioﬂ what do you lack? Financial resources?

[Knswej More than that! In 1946 the country was in ruins. It had lost
nine tenths of its locomotives and a third of its bridges. wean Honnet's
first plan set a few priorities. He had no financial resources, but his
intellectual authority was such that he was followed without question. our

ninth plan stakes everything on the same response.

@uestiog What do you expect from the planning reform you are about to
present to the National Assembly?

[A-nsweﬂ First, that it will sanction the political authority for the plan.
Then, that it will set up the procedures which will regulate relationships

between the state and all other planning agencies, from trade unions to
large enterprises, and including associations. What in fact differentiates

the right from the left is sharing of responsibilities. for our part, we
share them.

@uestiog? Will you share them when drastic measures become necessary—such
as cutting into health expenditures, for maple?

[Knswej That will indeed be necessary. Health expenditures increase two
to three times faster than our production. The solution is not to amwtate
social guarantees, but to change our thinking and behavior in matters of
health. In France we are too much in the habit of judging the effective-
ness of prescriptions by their length, and we often stay longer in hospital
than necessary. The French could in fact have the same quality of medical
services at less cost. But for that, there must be set up a new medical

education, better preventive medicine. and also a system of hose medical
services. What will settle the question of our social service deficits is

neither decrees nor laws. but s long-tern policy with participation by all
concerned.

@uestioﬂ Is it true that you were not invited to a nesting between those
responsible for the government's economic policy and the P8 lenders?

{Knew}? If that neeting had taken place, and because it was to bring up
economic strategy, it would have been indeed strange, to say the least, it
the minister of planning did not participate. But it did not occur.

[Gusting When you write your moire, will they contain surprising things
concerning this period?

[Knsveg That is quite possible, and it would be mining. But I do not
have a diarist's temperament. Action is what interests me. Francois Hit-
terand's septennate must be a great success. 'I'hat is what I work for, with
strictness and loyalty, after on fashion.

[Article by Alain Lancelot: "Cantonal Elections: a Beating”]

[Text] 0n l7 January, four districts which hed been barely won in June 1981
by four socialist deputies returned in the first round to four deputies fro-
the opposition, two of when were eat-ministers in the Giscard d'Estaing gov-
ernnent (beers J. Doainsti and A. Peyrefitte). his victory has been
interpreted in different ways. Bone were inclined to minimize it by con-
sidering local conditions in the districts in questionzwhich. according to
Mr Defferre "do not reflect the general opinion anong the French people":
“As far as we are concerned, this is a warning tether the: a failure. One
should not overreect," concluded Hr Herman. (hr the other hand, the opposi-
tion leaders interpreted it as "a splendid victory" (Hr Chirac), or "The
beginning of something whose end-result is certain" (Mr Giscard d'Bstaing).
On both sides, the next cantonal elections were eagerly anticipated.

The results are just in, and apparently without a-biguity: although the
leftist majority was understandably reluctant to adnit defeat in the first
round, they had to recognize the extent of the Warning" on the eve of the
second round. A warning which is all the more difficult to ignore than in
the past, cantonel elections have rarely been so extensively politicized.

This was partly beceuse of the socialist party, which was anxious to "confirn
the change" and the governnent whose ministers, starting with the prime nin-
ieter, expended unbounded energy, but also because of the opposition where Mr
Chirac was everywhere at once and Mr Giecard d'Bstaing was making a noisily
discreet comeback at Chamlieree. Watching all the "stars" on their 'l'V
screens, the voters could easily forget they were involved at the district
level and believe they hed gone 1 year back in tins. Rith one difference:
the absence of H: Hitterrend, who demonstrated his political flair by staying
out of the debates.

Even if the results of the two romds Md to result in a heating for the
majority, the president is not directly concerned and is in a position to draw
some lessons. But what lessons? A careful emination of the two rounds
should help make it clear.

The Problem of the Miscellaneous Left

The cantonal elections, uhtch involve seall electoral districts and favor rural
France, are strongly personallised elections where many candidates do not be-
long to a party. In the last 15 years. because of the effect of the ”majority
nationalisation" in French political life, the under of "miscellaneous" or
"independent" candidates have grown regularly smaller. The statistics drawn
up by succeeding ministers of the interior have probably speeded up this move.
Past ministers were excellent at finding 'boderates favorable to the Imjority."
The present minister claims all the 'hiscellaneous left." This must not
be taken too seriously: since statistics no longer include any hiscellaneous"
candidates, it is inevitable that some moderates not related to a party wind up
among the miscellaneous left or the miscellaneous right. From calculations by
the newspaper 1.3 me only tvovthirds of the 1982 miscellaneous left votes
(1.03 out of 1.6 percent) can be cwnted in the present majority.

Rounding Up Voters

Electoral participation, stimulated by the new local stakes created by de-
centralization and the national aspect resulting from a very lively political
campaign, was exceptionally high. there have never been so few sbstentions
under the Fifth Republic. hrch 1%2 confirms the tendency toward this point

of view: the nationalisation and politieation of local elections bring them
ever closer to national elections.

tering considering the differences in perticipetion.

The Mist Loss of Ground

The 15.9 percent of the PC ere locetsd betwshn the 15.3 percent of G. Merci-leis
in the presidential elections, end the 16.1 percent obtsined by the party in
the legislative elections: the loss of gromd is therefore confirmed, and is
even worse in es Inch as for the lest 10 yeers, the centonel elections hed been
the nost fevoreble elections to the ecu-mist petty. This loss of ground ob-
viously veries depending upon locel situetions, but it concerns urben domins
of the PC es well es rurel erees, thus providing e poor forecast for the 1983
nunicipel elections. The comnists, who hoped to gsin s new dignity by per-
ticipeting in the govertuent heve been duped: their perticipetion unless the.

class. Its dellying, not to say more, in the face of the situation in Poland,
topped the whole thing and caused a feeling of reject from national sensitiv-
ity. Overly Stalinian in its demegogue aspects, the Comnist Party gives the
impression of drifting without direction. Voters as well as militants have
noticed this and the Party runs the risk of progressively following the fate
of the diplodocus who also had a body that was too big for such a smell head.

The Confirmation of the Socialist Party

The Socialist Party can rightly claim to be the "first party of France." Its
progression compared to 1976 is marked (45.3 percent of valid votes) and even
compared to 1979 (+2.9 percent). Part of its progression, however, is due to
an increase in the nuber of socialist candidates: 1,859 in 1982 (95.6 per-

cent of the districts) compared to l,562 (86.7 percent of the districts) in
1976. This increase is also a partial explanation for the decrease of the

'hiscellaneous left" and, perhaps, some losses of the left radicals. This is

equivalent to saying that the PB's failure to gain from the con-mist losses
is even more important than it seems.

The Push by the Opposition to the Benefit of the an

The cantonal elections are traditionally favorable to moderate grouping who
more or less maintain their position at the national level (-0.9 percent of
valid votes and «3.3 percent of registered voters) by becoming somewhat
politicized: the part of the 1])? increases to the detriment of the inde-
pendents and miscellaneous right. But the 1982 vote has been marked on the
right by a progression of the RPR (+7.3 percent of valid votes cast).
Jacques Chirac's party is undoubtedly benefiting from the dynamism of its
leader who has had almost no competition from the opposition since my 1981,
and it is also benefiting from a policy which leads to a multiplication of
candidates: the RPR, which presented 853 candidates in 1982, is present in
103.9 percent of the districts whereas the IDR spanned only 501 in 1976.!and
was only present in 27.8 percent of the districts. Overall, the two major
parties of the opposition who went united into combat* met with comparable
success (17.9 percent of valid votes for the 853 m candidates and 18.8 per-
cent for the 900 to? candidates), as if voters had wanted to show that under

prevailing conditions, they cared less about what separates them than about
what unites them against the majority.

The Voters' Itinerary Through a Case Study

It is not possible, from a study of overall results, to find out where the com-
munist votes went. The study can refute the thesis of a mass abstention which

is not compatible with the increase in participation between l976 and 1982,
but it does not allow a decision batsmen two contradictory hypotheses: a mass
transfer to the PS along with a slide to the right of center voters who were
previously allied to the socialists, or a sharing of votes between the P8 and
the opposition. In order to try to clarify this, I have examined more closely

the results in a department of the Paris area where the leftist push had pre-
viously been strong and where the loss of ground has been very definite: the
Department of the Resonne.

Between 1976 and 1982, the evolution of the votes has been as follows in the
18 renewed districts:

Center and Left 37.181 24.3 30,6 37,7 47,?

Apparently, comnist losses are almost exactly balanced by socialist gains.
But this apparent explanation disappears as soon as one goes into detail for
the 18 districts: the cos-mist losses are rather better explained by the
pins of the opposition rather than those of the P8. It is clear that the PS
has only occasionally benefited iron the counnist losses; in most districts,
it only picked up a fraction of the votes, often definitely less than half.
The right has also certainly not gained entirely tron the communist losses,

but its progress see-s more related to the communist losses than the socialist
progress.

Available statistics allow a comparison between the results of the cantonal
elections and those from the 1981 legislative elections in 16 districts and

the presidential elections in 7 districts. These conparisons are instruc-
tive.

The Socialist Party has therefore certainly progressed in these 16 districts in
comparison to 1976. but it lost a quarter of the votes iron June 1981 while

the hsenorrhsgs of co-lunist votes continues. In this case, as confined by
the enslysis on e per district bssis, s snitch from the PC to the right is
very likely even if it seen less "logicsl" than successive slides from the

PC to the P8 end from the 1’8 to the right. This is because this ”logic"
ignores the fact that unhappy PC voters ere also often voters who have been
dioeppointed by the govern-ant end have been repelled by the socielist pre-
tention to lord it over everything. 8y voting for the right, these voters are
expressing their unhappiness by adopting a punitive behavior. The use of data
from the presidentisl election. which use only possible for 7 districts, does
not contradict this nave. It can be seen on the following table that the left,
and particularly the noncomnist left, has not recovered its spring 1981 level
whereas the right hes recovered port of the loss experienced in June.

PORTUGUESE COOPERATION WITH LUSOPHONB AFRICA REVIEWED

Paris JBUNE AFRIQUE in French 28 Apr 82 pp 63-66

[Text] Portugal began to develop its cooperation with the countries using
Portuguese as the official language iamediately after decolonisation. with
each state, it signed general agreements on cooperation and friendship and
scientific and technical cooperation agreements. In the sociocultural area,
more than a dozen agreements and protocol-annexes were signed concerning social
communication. health, education, and vocational training.

The implementation of these agreements takes the forn of sending short-tern
technical nissions, or advisers, and awarding of scholarships for vocational
training. The following tables show the effort invested in these three areas.

The Portuguese cooperation effort involves all the linistries, departments,
and companies with appropriate specialties. It is based on knowledge of the
various stages of development of African states, and the concept of mutual
help in respect for sovereignty and the principle of noninterference in the
internal affairs of the countries concerned, and also respect for national
dignity in international affairs. '

This is why Portuguese-African cosperation assumes the nature not of aid or
philanthropy but of solidarity and friendship.

This kind of cooperation naturally benefits from the following factors, al-
ready recognized as positive and contributing to special relationships: the
cannon language, a cannon cultural heritage, the presence of human capital
with a direct familiarity with the situation in the countries concerned, and
the existence in Portugal of organisations specialised in tropical area
studies, such as the Institute of Tropical hygiene and Hadicine and the
National Laboratory for Scientific Tropical Research.

The statistics in the tables also show, beyond the mere figures. the estab-
lishment of a genuine climate of friendship and understanding which is grow-

ing irreversibly.

This climate is evident in Portugal's relations with the Portuguese-speaking
African states and confirsed by frequent official visits: for example, the

visits by the Portuguese president to Cape Verde, the foreign sinister to
Angola, and the secretary of state for foreign affairs to Hosanbique. In the

2‘
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

opposite direction, Portugal has received the hosenbique foreign minister, the
Angola sinister of industry and energy, the Cape Verde minister of justice.
and the Hozabique sinister of industry.

Concrete results have been achieved in develop-ant of cooperation at all levels
and in all sectors. For example, there was the recent second-eating of the
joint permanent cooperation commission of Portugal and Angola which established
new prospects for strengthening econoaic and cultural relations between the two
countries.

The recent visit by Luanda by the president of the Portuguese Republic was a
significant expression of the will of the two peoples to develop together their
economic. financial, technical, and cultural relations, which provide substance
to cooperation in the reciprocal interest of both those who are giving and
those who are receiving.

There is continuing attention to all aspects of cooperation: the creation and
promotion of a zone of mutual expression. active and dynamic, supported‘ by the
strong elements of language and co-on tradition.

To this end, Portugal has set in its esbassies cultural centers with basic
libraries, including aagazines and newspapers and record collections. The
majority of the users of these centers. in addition to the advisers, of
course, are the local people thus attesting to the coununity of roots.

Another convincing proof of the Portuguese-African cooperation is the number
of grant students in Portuguese universities. at the higher School of Music
and at the Bissau Law School who are benefiting from Portuguese technical aid.
The sane is true at the Teachers College. which is training secondary school
teachers in Cape Verde, and there is also exchange of experience and documen-
tation in alaost all areas of public adainistration.

LEADERSHIP DBBAIB IN LABOR PARTY VIEWED
Amsterdan VIIJ NIDBILAHD in Dutch 5 Jun 82 p 3
[Article by J. Van Iijn and Max van weasel]

[Text] Hhile he was still applauded in Tiel. the leader knew
better. In a secret session his ninisterial colleagues re- ;
jected hin as leader. and the leadership of the parliamentary
delegation also left hin in the lurch. There were reasons
for the fact that the party leadership still wanted hin. tor
the first tine in 16 years he was not thinking for hisself
but was forced. A description of 10 days of drama in which
the PvdA [Labor Party] as one man deserted Den Uyl.

No politician gets his handkerchief out as quickly and unexpectedly during a
speech as Joop den nyl. In the middle of a sentence the speaker reaches sure-
handedly into his right pocket. out of which a small modal tea cloth appears.
In the middle of a word he thrusts the cloth under his nose. and while. half
stifled, he finishes the sentence. he blows his nose loudly and hephssardly
once or twice. In one notion he then finishes the sentence and hides the cloth
away again.

It happened again Monday morning [31 Hay] in the auction hall at rial, and per-
haps that was the last tine. Not that the speaker hinself seened to be inclined
that way, but toward the back of the hall the party members. Second Chamber nem-
bers. and former cabinet ministers cans to feel that it was really all over.

It was a family party; the Shakespeare family was there in great numbers. Hac-
beth and wife were there. and Polonius and his stepson hamlet, not to forget
Caesar, Hark Antony. Cassius. and Brutus. One big family. united around the
great leader. who has worn the 1hr: of the socialist party for 16 years now.

A tired face. anxious and tight-lipped under an array of flowers that one night
expect to see in Aalsnear rather than in Iiel. "Sails. Joop, damn it," he was
told on his wsy to the speaker's platforn. and sure enough. he did raise one
corner of his mouth. That was it for the tine being, until he really had to,
for the photographers and the party television canera.

Here the families fron riel. Bchteld, and Based had to sit and wait for hours.
They had sighed under the loudspeaker voluns from popular orchestras and lady
vocalists who at the last moment had come after all. A month ago when the
organizing co-ittee began arranging this answer to the CDA [Christian

28
I0! OYIICIAL 08! OIL?
“Rt 01’ 1‘ 101A]. use UNI-X

Democratic Appeal] festivities in Bossche and other cattle-market halls, at

that very moment Minister Van der Louw announced a considerable cutback in the
budget for the arts. That almost represented the coup de grace for the family
celebration at Tiel. No artist could decently appear before such an anti-arts
organization as the Labor Party. Performers who ordinarily make no bones about
adorning the personnel evenings of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy
or the Royal Middle Class Union suddenly refused to appear. Only the VARA
[workers Radio Amateurs Association] dance orchestra and Gregor Serban's orches-
tra showed that they had their heart in the right place. Then. thank God. two
weeks ago the cabinet fell, and since performing artists are not always long-
term political thinkers ("Van der Louw is out, so the cutbacks won't go through")
a number of them were ready to serve the cause of socialism.

So then Joop den Uyl spoke before an audience of several thousand. Up to tempo
from the beginning, even more hurried than usual. Be polemicized once more

against the interim cabinet, against the RV? [(former) Catholic People's Party].
against the 0'66 [Democrats of '66]; even hinted that the bombs falling on Iran

and Iraq. the absurdiet war in the Falklands, and the slowness of the negotia-
tions in Geneva were all to be blamed on the PvdA's not being in the govern-

ment. but soon, fortunately. arrived at the ones that are really to blame for
everything: the New Right in America and Europe. As so often before. his jokes
had no time for a point--there was one about cycling: "I do not ride a bicycle.
at least not on the road, at least not in public; this is the last time I am
going to talk about cycling, and I do not want to hear any more about it," and

he had thought up a rather unusual closing. A bit out of character. perhaps,
but it came out: "we must not promise more than we can make good on!"

The politicians, in the back of the hall with their hands in their pockets like
judges at an old-fashioned horse fair. had all heard it all before, but the
other 2.500 could not get enough of it. When Jeep den Uyl says: "It is not
true that income distribution has become stale and flat. Not a bit of it!

Just look around you!" even that is an experience for Tiel. And when the gray-
headed leader talks about unemployment as "that assault on human dignity," when
he says that "socialism is a productive movement," but most of all when, half
overcome by his own emotions and rhetoric, he declares: "In principle unem-
ployment is a solvable problem. and so we will have to find the social means

to solve it!" there is nobody that seems able to match him.

Den Uyl knows that his position within the party leadership is open to a great
deal of doubt. The party leader is aware that there are those within that
leadership who are attacking that position with force, if only because they see
in themselves or in a friend a better candidate. But he will not let his peo-

ple--or the microphones that are listening in. or the eager cameras of "Sonja
on Monday"--notice that.

Self-Pity

Just an hour later Den Uyl abandoned himself to an unusual form of self-pity.
in the intimate circle of party secretariat workers and aspiring party leaders.
They were saying good-bye to Keen Bode, the publicity man who has directed the

PvdA campaigns for 10 years. a thing that to Mayor Peper of Rotterdam was no
reason not to take him off to Rotterdam as an adviser. In a parting word Joop

29
' )3 OFFICIAL USE ONLY
den Uyl referred to the last. catastrophic chamber elections in which they had
worked together. "Last time it did not go well," the former minister of social
affairs and employment said, "but that was my fault, not Kees's." Very special
insiders knew that he was alluding to the words that the campaign leader ad-
dressed to the former standard-bearer lest spring in a smell group: "Joop, it
is not intended personally, but I cannot stay with you any longer." The at-
mosphere was most cordial. Hherees at similar CDA gatherings there is sometimes
a penetrating smell of the wild-animal cages at the Amsterdam Zoo, here in the
cafe Graaf Adolf (which is still in favor) at Tiel there was the free and easy
atmosphere of a widely ramified Sicilian family assembled en masse in the
notary's antechamber before the interment of the beloved head of the family.

There was one thing that concerned all those present and bound them together
as seldom before: what decision would Joop den Uyl finally make? Would he
stay on to save the party? Or would he leave to save the party? Would it be
a disaster for the party if he left? Or would it be a disaster if he remained?
Tuesday afternoon [1 June] a radio coamentetor put the question to Marcel van
Dam, minister of housing and land management in the second Van Agt cabinet.

Van Dam, who has in common with Dries van Agt, Erik Jurgens, Ed Nijpels, Bans
van Hierlo, Ruud Lubbere, and Piet Steenkamp the fact among others that he
studied under the Jesuits or a competing order. answered: ”Whatever decision
Den Uyl makes, a decision by him can never be a disaster for the PvdA."

One of those who were not sure a week ago what decision he must make was Joop
den Uyl himself. In what have undoubtedly been the worst 10 days of his career,
he was given notice on all sides in his party that his time was up. Friday
there was a dramatic meeting-~one of a series--at which the six socialist min-
isters from the last cabinet were assembled. together with Him Heijer, leader
of the parliamentary delegation. A comparison with the Last Supper seems far-
fetched--but although the number of guests is not right, and the table manners
of some of those present were faulty--it is, nevertheless, strikingly apt.

There they sat, gathered around the leader. Max van der Stoel, Den Uyl's
faithful comrade in arms for 20 years; Ed. van Thijn, for years voluntarily
the man behind Den Uyl, contriver end executor of campaigns, strategist, his
successor as leader of the parliamentary delegation, and one who, like him,
broke into national politics via the Amsterdam council; Jos van Kemenede, one
of the ministerial candidates because of whom the last cabinet almost was not
formed. a protegé-of Den Uyl's because of his origin, toughness.andunfeigned
socialist sentiment; Andre van der Louw, sent by Den Uyl to Rotterdam and sum-
moned back from Rotterdam, regarded as crown prince for the last 10 years,
thus surviving other crown princes like Andrd'Klooe and Him Duisenberg; and,
lastly, Marcel van Dam.

Every one of these gentlemen had a great deal to thank the party leader for.
In every case their careers had been determined by him, and they knew it. But
they also realized that they in turn had contributed much to the luster of his
career. Some more than others, all of them had at some time served as a
shield for Den Uyl, to the left or to the right. Some were real friends-

insofar as that is possible in politics and with Den Uyl-end all were com-
rsdes.

They all said that afternoon and evening, in a session that was so dramatic
that those present solemnly promised each other not to let it leak out where
the meeting took place, when, who was present, or even that such a meeting had
taken place; they all said to Den Uyl that it would be better if he decided

not to be the standard-bearer again in the coming elections. The arguments
differed. They varied from lack of power to attract voters due to insufficient
leadership given to the party, to such a solo performance within the cabinet

that he would be an obstacle to any renewed participation of the PvdA in the
government.

It may perhaps be assumed that during the dramatic session there were threats
by certain ones that they would no longer be available for certain jobs if Den
Uyl should decide to lead the party in Second Chamber elections for the sixth
time. Den Uyl must have been greatly hurt, especially by the unanimity of the

judgment, which, by the way, seems to have been expressed in what was called
great friendship.

Joop den Uyl had already been painfully surprised that morning during his
hastily swallowed breakfast. The morning papers”TBDUW and DB VOLKSKDANT both
started their front pages with the report that the Pvda parliamentary delega-
tion no longer had confidence in Den Uyl as standard-bearer.

And it was essentially true: from remarks by members of the delegation office
--the executive committee of the delegation, including in addition to Neijer
such politicians as Van der Hek, De Vries, and Castricum-Den Uyl must have re-

tained the impression that he had better not be the standard-bearer again in
the coming elections.

In short, the party leadership was deserting Den Uyl to a man.

That is to say, except for the party committee, even if only because this sec-
ond highest organ of the party--between congresses the very highest--has not
yet devoted a meeting to the question. Chairman Max van den Berg has had a
number of conversations with Den Uyl in which he seems to have advised the
latter to carry the standard one more time. Other members of the executive
committee, too--Deputy Chairman Poppe, Party Secretary Van Velzen. and his
deputy Rottenberg-—have also spoken with Den Uyl in the past week, and it was
pointed out in the conversations that while Den Uyl has the support of the com-
mittee, a decision to renaih available does not in itself solve the leadership
problem for the longer run. For if the former prime minister should decide to
step down sooner or later after the elections-a notion he flirted with on the
"Red Rooster" TV program last Saturday--it would be the parliamentary delega-
tion that would have to decide on his successor and not the party. It was
thus not pure loyalty to Den Uyl that reminded the members of the executive
committee of their duties. Den Uyl must have understood the hint well; like
others, he feels the anxiety of Van den Berg and some other members of the
party committee about the rise of Andre van der Louw. And his unfortunate
statement that he would rather not go back to the Second Chamber because his
earlier term in parliament was not the happiest time of his life? They do not
see even in that a guarantee that Van der Louw would not still, perhaps at the
eleventh hour, get himself reelected to the Chamber. In that case he would be
the strongest candidate for the succession.

In .the WD [People's Party for freedom and Democracy] the leader is ordinarily
selected by his predecessor; in the CDA the current leader designates himself
as successor. In the PvdA the politicians appeared paralysed. 3d. van Thijn.
crown prince for years, has twice been second on lists behind the respective
favorites, but ruled himself out. Jos van Kemensde, enthusiastically cheered
in September of last year at the Pvda congress that allowed the ministers to
participate in the cabinet, let it be known that he has no interest in the cabi-

net. Harcel van Dam, popular in large voter circles. made himself expressly
unavailable.

It must not be considered out of the question for long that some of the above.
including Van dar how, would accept the leadership if one siaple condition were
met. They would like to he asked as officially as possible in the name of the
party.

There is one nan thus far who has more or less received such an offer. A man
whom Den Uyl has thought of for years as his successor. but the very one who
in the eyes of sons in the party leadership underlined Joop den Uyl and gave
the Christian Democrats the excuse to effect Joop's destruction. "in Kok.

When we ask the mv [Netherlands Trade Unions Federation] chairman precisely
who has approached him and when, we run into an interesting linguistic question.
Where does the approach begin in such a case, at what point does approaching
change into sounding out. and when does the moment arrive that we can calmly
speak of "asking"? Since we cannot settle that. we let Kok himself deal with
it.

"Has van den Berg has not approached me," he says. “lie did ask as whether in
certain cases I would be prepared in principle to play a role in politics."

Kok has had a busy week with the gentlemen of the Labor Party. When he got
home Sunday evening last week from a business trip abroad he was telephoned by
Stan Poppa, member of the Second Chamber and deputy chairman of the PvdA, who
wanted to know whether he could go round to see Kok. A time was set for later
in the week; the conversation was to be on what wishes the WV might have with
regard to the future PvdA campaign platform.

The next day, Monday, two prominent PvdA'ers called up: Den Uyl and Van den
Berg. Den Uyl said it was urgent and went over to Kok's place the same evening
(after a speaking engagement in Zaanstreek). Kok says: "Hell, why not at my
place? The house was free, the coffee was hot. we did not talk about the party
leadership. Joop did say that he was preparing to make his decision."

The next day Chairman Van den Berg showed up at Kok's house—again the house
was free. again the coffee was hot. but this time, Kok admits, the talk was
about the position of standard-bearer. Kok says that he explained to Van den
Berg that only a short time before he had tied himself up with the PM for
another 3-year term as chairman. That only very weighty arguments could get
get him away from that. "Hears suggesting the possibility that Den Uyl will
make it known that he is no longer available, after which the still controver-
sial and vscillating Van der Louw would be considered to succeed him. Would
that be a weighty reason for Kok to ask the m to release him from his prom-
ise?"

Kok, now violently: "Oh, no, nothing of the kind! In the first place I am not
going to philosophize with you about who all would be in a position to follow
Den Uyl. If Den Uyl does not continue and another candidate's position is not
very good within the party, I do not have to be the man whose position is less
difficult. In principle my answer is an ironclad no.”

Later, too, he says: "My heart is in the trade union movement. I have worked
there for 21 years. Naturally I have loyalty to the Labor Party, too; I am a
member of the Pvda, and that sometimes creates a lot of problems, as we see here
again. But if in the party Jantje finds that he cannot work with Pietje and
Pietje finds that he cannot do anything with Jantje, I have nothing to do with
that." There almost seems to be a certain abhorrence when he adds: "It is a
whole different world. Although I do know those ministers and members of par-
liament, I find it almost impossible to imagine that I would take that step.

I can imagine that they would cook that up to make a new start with the trade
union movement after all that has happened, but if my possible service as s

standard-bearer has to guarantee the pro-union attitude of the Labor Party. I
think: now, now, that is a very fragile thing, you know."

It is not the most usual way of soliciting the leadership of the Labor Party,
but soliciting is not exactly what Him Kok is doing. There is the promise to
the PNV (where within the foreseeable future such mainstays as Herman Bode and
Frans Drabbe will also retire). Morevoer. he has no certainty about Den Uyl's
decision. For that reason he will not (be able to) regard Van den Berg's
offer as too official.

And to some extent that is Van der Louw's position as well. It is true that to
some extent he is supported by some of his former ministerial colleagues, but
they are keeping quiet at least until Den Uyl has made his decision. 0n the
other hand he knows that Van den Berg and some of the committee would not like
to see him get in. That has to do with his strange escapades with (especially)
the youth unemployment solutions that he trotted out as minister, especially in
the opinion of part of the party cadre. It does not look attractive to start
out in the leadership without a united party. and thus perhaps spend a years in
the opposition. ﬂoreover, he seems to be playing with the notion of succeeding
Haarten Vrolijk next year as the Queen's Commissioner [i.e., governor] of South
Holland (which seems at present to be the absolute and for successful politi-
cians in their forties).

And so the situation at the beginning of the week was: an interested waiting,
two potential successors who did not really want it-un1ess they had assurance
of support in the party-oand a leader who is thinking it over.

And so we are waiting again for him to decide, as we have for the last 16 years.
