MODERNIZATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS PLANNED

[Report on Prime Minister Pierre Hauroy's speech to the Institute for Advanced
National Defense Studies in Paris; date not specified]

[Text] Pierre Hauroy, prime minister of the French Government formed this June,
spoke at the opening session of the 34th class of the Institute for Advanced National
Defense Studies (IHBDN). He outlined, for the institute's civilian and military
auditors, the principal points of France's defense policy.

Recourse to a Genuine People's Mobilization

The prime minister opened his remarks by stating that "for a government, defense is.
like the threat, a comprehensive matter and cannot be examined solely from the
military viewpoint....

"A divided country is a weak country. To have Frenchmen take aetive responsibility
for their security, they must feel themselves bolstered and protected by the fact of
being part of the nation....

"Before being able to ask citizens to assume their responsibilities to society, the
latter should guarantee their rights, and foremost of all their right to work.

"Extended and more thorough deliberation on national compulsory military service. its
substance and its length. must incorporate particularly these established principles.
Beyond the fact that Our nuclear deterrent force cannot be the sole guarantee of our
defense and that it is essential for our three traditional military services to have
sufficient well-trained and well-equipped personnel. national compulsory military
service is one of the expressions of national solidarity. It is through such
service that the unity of the French people can and must show itself, unity that is
indispensable to the effectiveness of our defense policy.

"Although the present conjuncture precludes our reducing the length of compulsory
military service in the immediate future, there is still a need to make such service
more efficient. This term of service, during which each citizen fulfills, of course,
a duty but also exercises his right to learn the profession of arms, must be a period
of genuine instruction and training. And inasmuch as this is a right vested in each
citizen, there is no reason for women to be excluded therefrom in the name of a
historical tradition. Hence the women's voluntary service should be encouraged.

“A more substantial military service of truly operational character would make it
possible to face the problem of territorial defense dynamically by having recourse
to a genuine people's mobilization."

Independent Military Policy

After having emphasized that "France intends to remain loyal to its allies, the
foremost of which is the United States of America," and that it also "abides by all
of the treaties which produced the Western European Union," the prime minister
reminded his audience that "France's policy is by no means neutralist," that "any
isolation is impracticable," and that "aggression against France does not begin when
the enemy penetrates into our national territory."

He did point out, however, that "France intends to retain its independence in making
military choices and decisions. The instrumentality of this decision-making
independence is the nuclear deterrent. If General de Gaulle was able to follow an
independent military policy which resulted in making France withdraw from the North
Atlantic Treaty's integrated military organization, it is because he chose to give
the country a nuclear capability. It is true that research in this field had been
initiated much before General de Gaulle came to power.

"The government assumes full responsibility for continued implementation of that
choice. In fact. the country's military posture gives it no other means of recourse.

"Induced to seek an independent military defense system, our country has established
a powerful nuclear force for which it is indebted to no one. This gives it a
Specific role in the world and particularly in Europe...."

Anticities Strategy

Prime Minister Mauroy added: "French strategy remains, therefore, a strategy whereby
the weak deters the strong, in other words a strategy which can only be anticities.
It is essentially based on the capability of inflicting upon even the most powerful
aggressor damage deemed greater than the stake which the country's vital interests
represent to him. This strategy is made possible by what is called the equalizing
power of the atom. Yet this deterrence must also be credible, that is to say
actuated in the highest degree by an unshakable political will buttressed with a
clear and averred doctrine as well as with the existence of sufficient forces and
weapons to compel the adversary to so reckon with them that he forgoes his attack.

"A strategy is not immutable, however. and must adapt itself to changes in threats
and technologies. It is certainly quite out of the question for France to adopt,

like the United States, a strategy of deterrence comprising a varied and complete

range of responses that could be adapted, according to the situation, to different
possible levels of aggression....

Complementary Tactical Nuclear weapons

"Despite continous adaptations and modernization, the strategic nuclear deterrent
may prove to be inadequate by itself alone or may be circumvented. To avoid this
circumvention, conventional forces enhanced by tactical nuclear weapons now
complement the strategic nuclear deterrent. Tactical nuclear weaponry's role is to

restore deterrence at the strategic level. lts employment would serve notice of
the President of the Republic's determination to take extreme measures and resort.
if need be. to antipopulation nuclear weapons.

“Hence it is not a question of using tactical nuclear weapons to win a battle, but of
credibly brandishing, through them. the strategic nuclear threat in the event the
aggressor. were, in spite of everything. to start an armed conflict in the European
theater. In addition. the presence of these weapons in our conventional forces
compels the enemy to disperse his forces to reduce their vulnerability to nuclear
attack, thus reducing his offensive capability.

“For 7 years now, the army has been equipped with Pluton [surface-to-surface missiles]
for which a successor will soon have to be found. The navy, with its carrier-based
Super Etendard aircraft. and the air force, with its Jaguar aircraft, and soon its
Mirage 2000's armed with the medium-range air-to-surface missile. also have a
tactical nuclear capability.

"As is the case with our strategic forces, we should keep abreast of technical
advances by periodically adapting and modernizing the weapons and delivery vehicles
of our tactical nuclear arsenal."

Continued Study of Neutron weapons

Hauroy recalled that "the United States recently decided to arm itself with enhanced
radiation weapons, the so-called neutron bombs. Furthermore, the Soviet Union,
according to its very own statements, is thoroughly capable of producing such weapons.
These developments must alert us. Neutron weapons are tactical nuclear weapons for
the same reason as the others. They pose, therefore, a threat of employment on a
battlefield that could extend to Western Europe. As far as we are concerned, it
would not be rational to renOuace a priori acquiring a weapon that could increase

our deterrent capability. This capability still has to be given more thorough

study. That is why the government has decided to continue the studies on this
subject."

DETAILED ANALYSIS OF PRESIDENTIAL. LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS
Paris PROJET in French Sept-Oct 81 pp 915-939

[Article by Alain Lancelot. Center for Studying French Contemporary Life of the Na-
tional Political Science Foundation]

[Text] Just as after each election*, A. Lancelot analyzes here
in detail the results of the presidential and legislative elec-
elections: 7 weeks of elections threw political France in con-
fusion. After that "calm revolution." the socialists have many
trump cards in their hands. but they also have to face up to
considerable risks.

On 21 June 1981. the French people entered summer after having upset from top to
bottom their leadership and their political representation by a revolution as calm
as the one governing the change of seasons. who would have believed, 2 months
earlier. that Hitterrand would make a fool of Harchais in the first round, would
beat Giscard d'Bstaing in the second. would‘ elect to the Assembly“ absolute ma-
jority of socialist deputies and would finally admit communist ministers in the
government without causing this prodigious series to give rise in the nation to
anything other than congenial enthusiasm or genuine uneasiness? Who would have
said that Piterman would sit very naturally in D'Ornano's chair without giving
rise to anything other than curiosity. without the slightest appearance of the
shadow of the smallest "chaos"? French democracy is definitely more adult than
was thought. The political myths on which we have lived grew terribly old over-
night during the last few weeks. A great administration is asserting itself.

staffel] in May 1968. In order to arrive at a more fair evaluation of.the situa-
tion. we shall do our best to observe some scientific detachment. The exact ex-

impartial analysis of the fluctuations in the voters during the 7 weeks of recur-
rent elections through which France has just gone.

First Round: 26 April

The 1981 presidential election is the first one occurring at its nurmal time since
1965. That is to say that it was preceded by an interminable campaign. Since

the 1978 legislative election--in spite of the apparent distraction of;the.l979
European election-~preparation for the presidential election polarized France's
entire political activity. On the right. announcement of the first serious can—
didacy, Michel Debre. it is true. only dates from 30 June 1980. But then a Chirac
candidacy aimed at taking on speed. It had been predictable since the ”Cochin
call" in December 1978. if not since establishment of the RPR [Rally for the Re-
public] in December 1976. although it was not to become official until 3 February
1981. Meanwhile. Marie-France Garaud also entered the ring as a candidate on 23
October 1980. undoubtedly without giving rise to as many illusions as as Debre

on the deterrent effect of this decision on Chirac's candidacy. With regard to
Giscard d'Estaing. he announced his candidacy officially on 2 March 1981. but no
one never seriously doubted his desire. at the age of 55 years. to renew his term

in office.

0n the left. the candidacy of Harchais. announced on 12 October 1980. had been
foreseen as long as Chirac's candidacy on the right. The same logic applies: at-
tempt to restrain. if not to upset. the restoration of balance that occurred to
the benefit of the party most in the center in each of the two large coalitions
contending for the government of France. On the other hand. more uncertainties
surrounded the noncoumunist and the extreme left candidacies.

with regard to the noncommunist left. the problem was less that of a radical left
candidacy--finally settled on 28 February 1981 by the nomination of Crepeau--than
a problem of identity of the socialist candidate: Michel Rocard or Francois Hit-
terrand? Rocard dates from the evening of the second round of the 1978 legislative
election and constantly held the field captivating interest of the media and
prancing at the head of opinion polls. but he pledged. in the Hat: Congress. not

to seek the party's nomination against Francois Hitterrand. Hitterrand maneuverti
without declaring himself. He had opening of the nomination procedure within his
party delayed until autumn l980.allowing hisyoung competitor to put himself for-
ward on 18 October by means of the unfortunate "Conflans call." in order better

to make a fool of him a few days later by seeming to respond to the requests of
friendly federations. Francois Hitterrand. who announced his candidsdy on 8 Novem-
ber and who was nominated on 26 January 1981 by a unanimous special congress of
his party. regained abundantly the image of a 'winner' in the eyes of public opin-
ion hy replacing Michel Rocard. who had forbidden himself from opposing him. The
old fighter won a decisive "primary" without striking a blow. giving him new po-
litical youth as if he had taken over the youth of the discarded challenger.

0n the extreme left. division between the formations still raised the same problems.
Ariette Laguiller and Alain Krivine wanted to represent their separate Trotskyite
families. Huguette Bouchardeau intended to speak for the PSU [Unified Socialist
Party] and Roget Garaudy had become spokesman of the new "social movements" a long
time ago. close to the ecologist movement in which there were a number of candi-
dates for nomination: Brice Lalonde. selected by the 15 June 1980 "primaries."

Jean-Claude Delarue, and even Jacques-Yves Cousteau. But all those candidacies

ran up against the new provisions governing presidential elections since 18 June
1976, stipulating that no one can be a candidate. if he has not obtained the signa-
ture of 500 elected officials (members of Parliament, departmental councilmen.
mayors) belonging to at least 0 departments or overseas territories. These strict
regulations rejected A. Krivine in the far right and the two extreme left candidates
who announced their candidacy on the same day, 11 November 1979: Jean-Marie Le Pen.
nominated by the National Front, and Pascal Gauchon, nominated by the New Forces
Party. In addition. it dissuaded Roger Garaudy. Jean-Claude Delarue and even--if
we believe the press--about 60 other more or less freakish candidates from having

a chance to present their ideas during the great April-May 1981 election meet.

A Negative Campaign

Four features of the election campaign of the 10 candidates finally approved by
the Constitutional Council merit being pointed out: 1. this campaign contributed
practically nothing: everything had been said and repeated since 1978; 2. it was
dominated by unemployment and inflation: all the outgoing president's adversaries
claimed to do better than he and he himself promised to make the struggle against
unemployment the first of his priorities; 3. consequently. the campaign was more
negative than positive: the nine "anti-Giscard" candidates criticized the eco-
nomic and social policy of the Barre government, which they accused of having made
the crisis worse, and Giscard d'Estaign assured that the policy of his successors
would be still worse; 4. aside from the "little" candidates who often contributed
a certain amount of freshness. the campaign prize list gave the advantage to Chirac
and Mitterrand over Giscard d'Estaing and Harchais. Chirac's campaign was definitely
the more dynamic and the most inventive one. although this invention consisted

in importing the topic of less central government authority dear to Reagan. Hit-
terrand's campaign had effective discretion. Under the sign of "the calm force."
the socia.ist candidate was careful not to put himself forward too much and he
carefully smoothed out all his personal or political rough spots. Giscard d'Bs-
taing's campaign. condemned to repeat presidential or governmental speeches.
lacked a little wind and conviction. disillusioning those who expected miracles
from entrance in the race by the office-holder. With regard to the campaign of
MarchaiS. it was content to repeat a well-worn "act" in which irony was mixed with
brutality on a background of simplistic demagoguery that was beginning to tire.

Apparently, nothing very new. consequently. when destiny gave the three traditional
knocks and the curtain was raised-on26 April on the first tableau of an "election
drama" about which it was not yet known whether it would involve two or four acts.
But as early as the evening of the first round. surprise was in the contest. Some-
thing budged, as is shown by the results given in table 1 [next page].

If we adhere to great trends. the change was certainly limited in comparison with
the three previous elections:

The participation, just honorable and nothing more, expresses rather well the bore-
dom produced by the campaign. The left was outclassed, on the whole, by the major-
ity just as in 1979 and 197b, while it had the advantage in the first round in
1978. The ecologists confirmed their foothold. Even if we abided by these great
trends. these results, however, make it possible to foresee the defeat of Giscard
d'Estaing who won by only 1.3 percent in the second round in 1976, while he had

a much more comfortable potential. The left, which gained 1.2 points in 7 years.
while the right lost 3.8. entered the election with a certain advantage.

This advantage is still more evident when we go into detail on the distribution
of votes between the various candidates and especially when we take into account
the strength relationships within each coalition.

Division of the "Majority"

The first round was very disappointing to Valery Giscard d'Estaing. With 27.8
percent in metropolitan France. the outgoing president barely did better than Veil's
ticket in the European election (27.4 percent). A fortiori. he did not pick up

the sum of the percentages of the Veil and Servan-Schreiber tickets in that same
election (29.3 percent), or his own percentage in 1974 (32.9 percent).

From a geographic point of view. if we disregard two departments, one exceptionally
favorable (Bas-Rhin) and one unfavorable (Correze). the distribution of Giscard
votes is rather spreadout. Giscard d'Estaing exceeded 25 percent in 74 departments.
Tie 22 rebellious departments included--in addition to Haute Corse Nievre. Belfort
and five departments in the Paris suburbs--lh contiguous departments in the south-
western quarter of the country. In comparison with 1974, this geography is defin-
itely less in contrast. The "low spots" corresponding to the strength areas of

J. Chaban-Delmas in the southwest and of J. Royer in Touraine were filled in and
the "high spots" in the Breton and Lower Normandy west, the Lorraine, France-
Comte and Savoyard east and the Massif Central were mostly worn down. Thealbst;
votes were undoubtedly given to the Gaullist movement and to the noncommunist.left.

Altogether, the strength relationship within the majority was definitely less favor-
able to Giscard d'Estaing in 1981 than in 1976 and 1979:

 

 

Candidate 1215 1979 1981
Giscard d'Estaing 32.9 Veil 27.4 Giscard d'Bstaing 27.8
Chaban-Delmas 14.6 Chirac- 16 l Chirac 18.0
Debre '
Royer 3.2 Debra 1.6
Garaud 1.3

Does J. Chirac have grounds for being satisfied for all that? It all depends on
what he was looking for and I admit total ignorance on this point. If he wanted
primarily to weaken the outgoing president. as he incessantly did everything pos-
sible since the winter of 1978. on 26 April he must have felt that he had at-
tained his objective. even if Francois Hitterrand was better placed for pulling
the chestnuts out of the fire. If he wanted to win over Valery Giscard d'Bs-
taing or at least to appear in the second round as he claimed to be capable of
doing. the failure measures up to his aspirations. Obviously Chirac could not

8

replace Giscard d'Estaing within the majority. "as he a victim of his dreams?

Did he believe for a moment that he could force destiny or was he resigned to ss-
botaging the Majority, expecting to float to the surface and represent the re«
course? It is iqossible to decide and perhaps the question makes no sense. axi-
rac. who is neither so naive or so perverse, night very well have been satisfied

to obey an impulsive temperament that only takes the present moment into account.'3¢
that as it may, his results were far from negligible. Chirac. who reached 61.6
percent in Correze. exceeded 25 percent of the votes cast in six departments and

no where fell below 13 percent (Nievre: 13.6). His strength areas were still
located in the western half of the country. but they expanded in comparison with
the European election. The Limoges strongholdspread toward the south and the north.
The western stronghold was strengthen in western Normandy. The Parisian stronghold
expanded to the west of the capital anda few high spots showed up in the Alpine
southeast. 0n the other hand. the north and the east. once so Gaullist. are hardly
recognized in Chirac.

The scores of Michel Debts and Marie-France Garaud are so low that they call for
no consent. Lumped together. they were still lower than Royer's score in 1976.

In Indre-et-Loire. the mayor of Amboise obtained 6.3 percent. while the mayor of
Tours obtained 33.8 percent. In Amboise itself. Debre beat Chirac by only 22 votes
and was 361 votes behind Giacard d'Estaing. The presidential election definitely
likes only large battalions.

Reorganization of the Left

On the whole. the left did a little better in 1981 than in 1976: 67.3 percent.
compared with 66.1 percent. or a gain of 1.2 point. That minimum gain is due to
small thrust by the extreme left. which went from 2.7 to 3.6 percent (+0.7) and
to the good overall result of the parties supporting Francois Hitterrand in 1976.
At that time. he obtained 63.3 percent as the single candidate of the left. The
communist. socialist and radical left candidates totaled 63.8 percent (+0.5) in
1981.

But this overall stability conceals a formidable upset within the voters of the
old "union of the left," which was the decisive factor in the first round and with-
out doubt in the whole election series analyzed here. The number of communist
voters declined sharply. while the number of socialist voters increased in the

same proportions. Ten years after the Bpinay Congress. P. Hitterrsnd seems to
have won his bet to edge out the PCIF]. which is the sole key to power for the
left:

Party 1973 1978 1979 1981
PCIF] 21.6 20.6 20.6 15.5

PS-HRG [Radical Left Movement] 20.8 26.9 23.7 28.3

The setback took on historic proportions for Georges Harchais. The Communist Par-
ty was brought back to its 1936 level. It obtained a million fewer votes than
in November 1966. while it had 10 million more voters. Just as in 1958. at the

time of General de Gaulle's return to powen the party suddenly lost one—fourth
of its votes.

The comunist setback is striking not only because of its size but also because
of its relative uniformity. Areas of strength and areas of weakness of the party

are struck in rather comparable proportions. A few examples taken at various
levels of comunist establishment show this well:

1979 to March 1980, the PC? lost 6.6 percent of its votes in comparison with pre-
vious elections in a total of 37 partial electioasz. From April 1980 to April
1981, it lost 16.9 percent in a total of 48 cases. This is still far from the
25-percent amputation undergone on 26 April, but the decline seems to have started.

This declinewhs Francois Mitterrand's historic chance, the first "green light"

on the road to his election and total victory. F. Hitterrand, who made socialist
influence progress in 75 out of 96 departments, has a personal establishment almost
as strong as that of the outgoing president. The gap was only 1.7 point in metro-
politican France. His two large strengh areaswere the southwest and the east,

from Hoselle to Saone-et~Loire. But he also exceeded the national average in some
departments in the Alpine and Rhone southeast. the center-west and western France
(Haute Normandie and Bretagne). In comparison with 1978, socialist progress was
especially noticeable in the Parisian basin. the Alpine southeast and sons departments
in the Aquitanian southwest and Cmarentais. 0n the other hand, socialism dropped
back in 21 departments, some old eroded fiefs (Nord. Pas-de-Calais. Haute-Vienne)
and some young mission territory (Hayenne, Cantal or Laute-Loire).

In order to evaluate more accurately the influence of democratic socialism, it
would, without doubt, be necessary to add the votes for Michel Crepeeu to the votes
for F. Hitterrand. The president of the left radicals came in sixth, just behind
A. Laguiller. His results are quite uneven all over France. They exceeded 3 per~
cent of the votes cast in 10 department: five in the center-west sensitive to

the influence of the mayor of La Rochelle (Charente-Maritime: 11.9 percent, Cha-
rente, Vendee, Deux-Sevres and Vienne) and five traditional fiefs of Left Radicals
(Haute-Corse. Tara-et-Garonne, Lot, Indre-et-Loire, Bure-et—Loir; but Pabre's
Aveyron was cool toward his successor at the head of the MRS [Left Radicalsl).
Elsewhere. Crepeau obtained a very small success, a little more marked in the high-
ly urbanized departnents. perhaps because of his ecologist options.

The extreme left, represented by two candidates. Arlette Laguiller and Euguette
Bouchardeau. obtained, with 3.6 percent, a score slightly higher than in the four
previous national elections. without recovering the exceptional results of the
immediate "after May 1968" (4.7 percent in 1969). In comparison with that period.
the PSU was edged out by Trotskyism:

 

Party 1969 1981
PSU : Rocard : 3.6 Bouchardeau : 1.1
Trotskyism : Krivine 1.1 Laguiller : 2.3

Together the two candidates exceeded 4 percent in eight departments distributed
very significantly in two traditionally protestor-self-management regions: Brit~
tany (Finistere. Ille~et~Vilaine, Cotes-du -Nord, Loire-Atlantique) and the Jura
andﬂbsgeseast (Belfort. Jura. Doubs and Vosges). Elsewhere, the best scores were
obtained in the Rhone-Alpes region and the Parisian region.

In those regions, the extreme left. in its PSU component especially, suffered.
however. from ecologist competition. Hith 3.9 percent of the votes, Brice Lalonde

actually obtained rather fine success. slightly below the 4.6 percent of the Pernex
ticket in the 1979 European election, in which the green vote had hardly any conse-
quences. but definitely higher than the 1.3 percent of Rana Dumont in 1974 and

the 2.2 percent of the ecologist movement in the 1978 legislative election. In
spite of the strictness of the majority system, the ecologist movement, therefore,
succeeded in forcing its vote among the country's permanent political movements.
Its influence exceeded 2 percent in 93 departments and 4 percent in 32. Its strong
points were the Rhone-Alpes region, Jura. Alsace, the Parisian region and some
departments involved in the nucleoelectric program (Hanche, Finistere, Loire-
Atlantique especially).

The left, freed from the communist possibility and showing a smell amount of pro-
gress in comparison with 1974, seemed in a position to win as early as the evening
of 26 April. The action of withdrawals, the climate in which they were made and
the development of the campaign turned this probability into certainty well before
the end of the 2 weeks between the two rounds. Withdrawals occurred very quickly
on the left. On 28 April, G. Harchais, A. Laguiller. M. Crepeau and H. Bouchardeau
all called on their voters to vote for F. hitterrand. Without illusions for some.
but with no reservations. And if Harchais still let himself he carried away to
say on television "Have you already seen me roll without cause?", he inspired less
fear than pity and the PCP refrained from the slightest provocation. 0n the right,
we had to wait until 5 May for Debree to call sspecia¢ly for votes for the outgoing
president and Garsud could not decide to do that. On 7 May, she announced that

she was going to cast a blank ballot. On 27 April, Chirac believed that there
were no grounds for withdrawal. On 10 May. he said that each one should vote ac-
cording to his conscience," adding, nevertheless. that "personally ... I can vote
only for Ciscard d'Estaing." 0n 6 May, he took note of the outgoing president's
statements made in the direction of his own points of View and concluded that "I
hope that, like me, (the French people) will be aware of the dangers that the
election of Mitterrand would make France incur." This new appeal did not cancel
out the disastrous effect caused by a first week of delays and demobilization on
the voters for the majority.

In that campaign between the two rounds. Giscard d'Estaing refused. mistakenly
without doubt, to dramatize what was at stake in the election and to warn that

he ran a strong risk of being beaten, while all the forecasts still continued to
regard him as elected, contrary to all logic and contrary to the polls. He was
undoubtedly also mistaken to stake so much on his televised debate with Hitter—
rand, going so far as to request two at the outset. This kind of meeting has lit—
tle effect on voters. 0n the other hand. he cannot be blamed for putting forward
the "socialist project." in order to force Hitterrand to come out of the vague-
ness in which he was bathing his campaign. The manner in which the socialist can-
didate eluded his party's project and held to the small list of his "proposals"
smacked a little of a clever trick. But he had to remain consistent with the ini-
tial bet that he made very rightly to hold out just to the end: to show himself

as little as possible, to uncover himself as little as possible and to play the
lamb up to the eve of the election. Consequentlyq an outgoing president who wears
himself out asking questionsof'the sphynx is regarded as an impotent challenger.

Key:
1. Registered 3. Blank and void
2. Voters 6. Valid votes

The 10 Hay results (table 2) show that this strategy paid off. P. Mitterrand,

who was beaten by 346,399 votes in metropolitan France in 1976. won this time over
V. Giscard d'Estaing with a lead of 1,322,856 votes. In number of votes. each

of the two candidates exceeded. in the second round, his potential in the first.
V. Giscard d'Estaing obtained 301,055 votes more than the total for the right and
F. Hitterrand 2.073.498 more than the total for the left. Therefore, the some
1,118,000 ecologists were not the only ones to arbitrate. Mobilization of ab-
stentionists also played a part. In fact, ebstentionism dropped by 1,676,475 units.
But, in view of the duplication--easily expiainahle--of blank and void ballots,
the number of votes cast increased only by 1.256.591. By adding the number of
these new votes cast and the number of ecologist voters, we obtain a total of
2,374,823 votes theoretically available to each of the two camps. According to
national statistics. 87 oercent of these potential voters seem to have chosen the
left.

This calculation shows up very well the size of F. Mitterrand's victory, even though
it is naturally unrealistic. In fact, it would assume that discipline was perfect
in each camp and that all the voters in the first round also voted in the second.
Both conditions are false.

The increase in participation certainly does not facilitate analysis of the elec-
tion discipline by often masking all or part of the bad reports. Often, but not
always. at least on the right. While F. Nitterrand obtained, in votes and in per-
centages. better results that all the left in every department, the situation was
much less uniformly favorable for V. Giscard d'Estaing.

As might be expected. the 16 unfaithful departments all belong to J. Chirac's
strength areas, especially in the Limoges region. La Correze is almost caricatural
in this respect. because V. Giacard d'Bstaing did not even get the number of votes
in the second round that J. Chirac obtained in the first. In order to detect signs
of infidelity on the left, it is necessary to drop down to the communal level and
carefully select among the communes with a strong communist implantation. Thus,
traces ofdtscontent are found in Ivry, Villejuif or Arcueil. But only traces.
Essentially. discipline worked well on the left and F. Hitterrand owes his success,
in the following order. to communist discipline, an increase in participation,

a transfer of Chirac voters and the carryover of the majority of ecologist voters.
The postelectoral poll taken by SOPRES [French Opinion Polling Company] confirms
these conclusions and makes it possible to make a credible appraisal of the trans-

fers from one round to the other.

Owing to these contributions. Francois Mitterrand brought the total number of left-
ist votes up to a level never attained since the establishment of the Fifth Repub-
lic. How is that explained? First of all, the modification of the.body of voters
must not be overlooked. From 1978 to 1981, there were an additional 1,056,102
registrations in metropolitan France. But. in that same period. mortality struck
around |.515,000 persons of voting age. Therefore. new registration amount to
around 2.57 million persons. mostly young persons about whom polls show us that
almost two-thirds of them voted for the socialist candidate.. Even if we agree
that these new registered voters may have abstained more than than their elders
(on the order of a fourth). they did not contribute less than 1.2 million votes

to F. Hitterrand compared with only 700,000 to his opponent, hit, on the other
hand. more than proportionally by the death of elderly voters.

Added to that is the effect of the nobilization of abstentionists. Allost 88 per-
cent of the registered voters voted on 19 Hay 1976 and over 83 percent on 12 March
1978. while only 81.7 percent voted on 26 April 1981. Therefore, there was un-
deniably a reserve of potential leftist voters, in view of the second round within
abstention. 0n the basis of the second round in 1976. this reserve night amount
to 1.9 million voters, approximately. At least3 1.6 million were undoubtedly no-
bilized to ensure P. Mitterrand's victory on 10 Hay.

There remains the transfer of voters who voted for Chirac, Debre or Garaud in the
first round. Apparently. a conversion more difficult to explain is involved. Nei-
ther J. Chirac's “para-Reaganismd'nor H. Debre's historical De Gsullism, nor

M. F. Garaud's antisovietism leads to a choice of F. Hitterrand rather than V.
Giscard dfﬁstaing. But political space is not one-dimensional. Hagyvoters who
voted for the three archeo- or neo-Gaullist candidates in the first round essen—
tially expressed rejection of the outgoing president, accospanied by a preference
for replacement rather than for rotation. "hen replacement failed, a considerable
part of those favoring replacement chose a change when faced with a choice between
continuity and' change. Because aspiration to a change was very strong in the
spring of 1981. The prospects of seeing the same man and, without doubt, basically
the same team. stay in office 7 more years, that is to say a total of 16 years.
seemed truly intolerable to many. De Gaulle himself was able to remain in office
only 11 years and his supports dropped, during that period. from 79.2 percent to
46.8 percent.

Moreover. the French people ended up by believing that the crisis was made worse
rather than attenuatedby the policy of the Barre government. This opinion is not
shared by most of the foreign experts. but the voters do not search for their rea-
sons in economic periodicals. when the RPR joined in . the concert of critics
of the opposition, the government's economic policy appeared to the majority of
the people to be an inadmissible failure. Under those conditions, reelection of
v. Giscard d'Estaing promiscdtC)be difficult. Deterioration of his personal image
resulting from unworthy campaigns. but also owing to the accentuation of certain
defects (taste for political "gadgets," inability to open himself up to question,
selection of a flattering following) were to do the rest. Seven years ago, the
article that I wrote for PROJET ended as follows: "If the new team fails, there
is no longer any other solution than rotation and opening up--so desired and so
feared-rofulsocialist experiment. For V. Giacard d'Estaing. replacement time is
also time for surceaee.“

Worsening of the crisis. abandonment of the reform prospects at the beginning of
the 7-year term to the benefit of an ultraconaervative orientation centered on
security. the mortal split kept up by the ambition of Jacques Chirac and his
friends prevented this surcease. extended by a miracle in 1978 by the suicidal
division of the opposition, from being renewed for 7 years. But, all in all,
history might well be more merciful than politics toward Giscard d'Estaing.

3 At least, because the new 10 Hay voters were still unre-numerous than it seemed,
owing to the fact that some 26 April voters abstained in the second round.

Upsurge of Socialism in the 14 June Legislative Election

The election of Francois Mitterrand changed the facts of the electoral situation
from top to bottom. It is an understatement to say that hope changed sides. From
then on, legitimacy has been illuminating the socialist movement with its incompar-
able light and this movement has been benefiting fully. from then on, with the
majority logic of the institutions of the Fifth Republic.

When he was inaugurated on 21 May. in the rejoicing of a youth that was hardly
recognized in the previous administration, F. Hitterrand became "president of the

Republic." On that same day. he appointed P. Hauroy prime minister. 0n the next
day. the National Assembly was dissolved and an almost exclusively socialist

17

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

government was formed. The content may change; the forms remain. An experiment

is starting, but the Republic goes on and the logic of stability works, as always,
in favor of the presidential trend. A socialist vote means giving the president
the means for fulfilling the mandate with which he has just been entrusted. It
means loyally trying the experiment. A vote for the outgoing majority, means kill-
ing change before it has hatched and immediately bringing a political crisis to

the heart of the institutions.

Now, the change immediately proved to be positive for the greatest number. If

the stock market collapsed and if the francwus threatened, that did not affect

the French people immediately. The same does not apply to the distributive mea-
sures adopted by the ministerial cabinet on 3 June. The increase in the SHIC [Inter-
occupational Minimum Growth Wage]. the minimum old-age benefit, family allowances,
the housing allowance seemed to be the pledge of the government's desire to imple-
ment another economic and social policy and they gave the poorest fraction of the
population the impression of a real oxygen flask. In the belief that only "the
rich will pay," the French people were discovering the good side of the restart.

A good side that is all the more sensible since the rotation was accomplished with-
out the slightest crisis. the slightest street movement. the slightest false note.
The "chaos" always announced, the "May '68" calmly predicted by the right, did

not show up. The socialists were bathed in a state of grace. The right was legal-
istic and the PCP was trying to save its assets in the legislative election.

The prospects of the election evidently dominated the period. The Socialist Party
approached them with a couuunicative faith that was barely tarnished by a few in-
clinations toward anti-Rocard pettiness in the investitures. It played up fully
the presence of the socialist government. In my district, the socialist candidate
and his alternate pledged. in a profession of faith of the purest Radical-UDR [Union
of Democrats for the Republic] style "to be the interpreters of the aspirations
(of the voters) and of the vital needs of our region with our minister friends,
several of whom came recently to discuss with you." The PCP, in turn, was con«
stantly putting itself before the eyes of all in the new majority. The time when
Harchais threatened, in a high-pitched voice, not to "go along for a free ride"
seemed very remote! Jospin. who replaced Hitterrand as first secretary of the

PS when Mitterrand announced his candidacy. took note. not without irony, of this
new attitude at the opening of negotiations between the two parties. He said:

”We appreciate the new tone that you have adopted, the prudence of your remarks,
at times even the quality of your silence." On a June, an agreement was concluded
that stressed the convergences. confirmed the automatic desistance needed for "es-
tablishment of a coherent, lasting majority.” but it says nothing about participa»
tion by communists in the future government. "Starting at that time (victory of

a leftist majority). a new meeting will be necessary." Harchais asked for no other
commitment and his candidates almost forgot to indicate their party's name on their
posters on which they presented themselves first of all as candidates of the left
union majority.

On the right, the election strategy was played in the few days following P. Hitter-
rand's victory. 0n ll Hay, Giscard d'Estaing, forgetting that he had Chirac's

name applauded the week before when he needed his rallying, denounced "the pre-
meditated treasonable acts" that led to his defeat, and Lecanuel seemed to echo
him by advocating generalized primaries within the outgoing majority, contrary

to Chirac who proposed, on the other hand, a single candidacy. The initial

18
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLV

position of the Giscard followers was undoubtedly not very realistic. 1t under-
estimated the discredit suffered from the 10 Hay defeat and the desire for unifi-
cation on the part of the outgoing UDP [French Democratic Union] members who were
not very anxious to fight on two fronts. Very quickly, the need for union overrode
resentment. Chirac and Lecanuel signed a pact "of union for the new majority"

on 15 Hay. calling attention of the two parties of the outgoing majority to the
common principles and announcing a unified campaign. The primaries will continue
to be the exception, 86 officially, or in less than one out of five districts in

metropolitan France.

This decision, together with the conditions of consultation that left little time
for the small parties to seek out spokesmen and little hope for the irregulars
because it was so obvious that the P8 was well favored, contributed to reducing

the total number of candidates: 2.648 in metropolitan France compared with 6,184
in 1978. This lack of spirit of competition also characterized the campaign.
Everything had been said and no one paid any attention any longer to party speeches.
In the field, on the other hand. a number of socialist candidates felt inclined

to stir up enthusiastic interest.

' The PS More Alone Than Dominant
The 16 June results (table 3 (next pagel) show that they were not mistaken.

In spite of an increase in abstentions, the socialist victory is impressive. In
comparison with 1978, the PS-MRG [Socialist Party-left Radical Movement] pro—
gressed 12.8 points to the detriment of all the other parties and movements. The
right lost h.9 points, the Communist Party 6.5, the extreme left 1.9, the ecolo-
gists 1.1 and miscellaneous left 0.1.. No need for comment on the setback of the
small parties. It is explained in part by the decrease in the number of candidates,
which declined from 1.034 to 598 for the far left and from 261 to 172 for the eco—
logists. 0n the other hand, let us review the principal movements.

The upsurge in abstentionism puts it at a level that it has exceeded only twice in
legislative elections since 1875: in November 1962 and exactly 100 years ago,

in August 1881. This reminder suggests two explanations. In 1962, the legislau
tive electiontook place after a dissolution in the aftermath of the referendum

on election of the president by universal suffrage. The increase in abstention
expressed both in some a feeling that the essential act had been raised in the
referendum and in others the difficulty of choosing between the deputies of their
traditional parties. who continued their "no" campaign and the Gaullists who asked
them to have their "yes" respected. Taking into account the respective differences.
the same motivations may have been brought into play in 1981. with the vote for

F. Hitterrand taking the place of the "yes“ vote in 1962. The 1881 precedent brings
up another situation. the situation described by Andre Siegfried as "appeasement,"
when the demoralized right no longer even dared oppose the republicans. Is it not
possible that this was the case 100 years later and does the victory of the left
not express still more the demobilization of the right rather than its rallying

to the president's party?
To tell the truth. it very difficult to answer without proceeding to make a very

detailed analysis. A study by department shows, in fact, that no simple explana~
tion takes into account the great increase in abstentions. This did not effect

especially those departmentsinwhich Giscard d'Estsing did not receive the full
number of rightist votes. 0n the contrary, it was probably less pronounced there.
Therefore, the assumption«:oncerning the difficulty of the moderates who probably
voted for Hitterrand does not seem to be verified. at least at this analysis level.
The same is true of the hypothesis of a massive transfer of the right. The map

of abstention gains only partly confirms the hypothesis of losses by the right.
Just as it only partly confirms the hypothesis of communist losses. The votes
lost by the right and PCP seem to have been distributed in variable proportions
between the socialist vote and abstention, in accordance with a logic that eludes
an analysis by department.

The communist setback confirms the breakup of the presidential election. It even
aggravates it, in fact, because national statistics on voting are more misleading
for legislative elections than for a presidential election. In legislative e1ec~
tions. account must be taken. in fact, of the local implantation of the candi-
dates. As was predictable, the 86 communist deputies recovered part of the votes
lost by c. Harchais. especially in the Parisian region. Moreover, the deteriora-
tion continued in votes and in percentages.

Outside the districts well-covered by the PCP and its elected candidates. the set-
back was. therefore. considerable in comparison with 1978. One-third of the com-
munist voters defected and a good part of them voted for the socialist candidates.
Because the were bearers of "real change" and because the presidential election
revealed that the communist king was naked. his voters felt freed from a faithful-
ness of habit more than of conviction.

The setback of the UN! [New Majority Union] did not reach the same proportions

as the PC? setback. but it was severe. The UDP and the 828 together obtained

43.9 percent in 1978. In 1980. they totaled 40.1 percent. or a 9-percent loss.

The game of single candidacies, favoring the outgoing ones, solidified the strength
relationship between the two formations. The RPR represented 52.1 percent of the
total, compared with 51.3 in 1978.

The single candidscics were blamed for preventing the outgoing majority from ob-
taining all its votes--owing to resentment between its two components-and from
spreading over its frontiers. This process was hardly justified in view of the
results. The calculation of votes that I made in the 86 districts in which priv
maries were held shows that this formula does not necessarily make it possible
to "rake wider":

In addition. single candidacy enabled the UN“ to have 99 deputies elected as early
as the first round in metropolitan France (and 1 overseas) or almost two-thirds
of its 156 deputies. Directly hit by the wave of change and caught on the wrong
foot by the logic of the majority institutions of the Fifth Republic. the outgoing
majority could hardly expect better.

The socialistupsurgeremains. ltwas absolutely general in comparison with 1978,
although unequal in extent depending on the department:

Socialist Upsurge in Percent of Votes Cast
Number of Departments

Gain less than 51 2
Gain from 5 to 9X 17
Gain from 10 to 14.92 59
Gain from 15 to 20% 18

The gains were especially massive south of the Loire (16 departments out of the

18 in which the gains exceeded 15 percent), especially in the southwestern quarter
(9 departments). 0n the other hand, they were generally a little less strong in
the traditional s':ength areas of the right. in the west and in the east, or of
the PCP, in the Parisian Basin. There, undoubtedly. the PS ran up against absten-
tion. Altogether, the Socialist Party was more alone than dominant. The PCP and
the righthad been. at least temporarily, discredited and demoralized by the presi-
dential election and the P5 was in a position to embody both change and stability.
It had become. if not the wheels of the instituions, at least the "fluid" needed
for their operation, just like the Gaullist movement after 1962.

The Socialist Victory in the Second Round: 21 June

The last act of the 1981 "election drama," the second round of the legislative
election, confirmed the movements of the first round and gave the PS alone an ab-
solute majority of seats in the Assembly. Because 156 deputies had been elected
in the first round (154 in metropolitan France and 2 overseas), the second round
involved 332 districts on 21 June. On that same day, they voted for the first

round in three ov rseas districts.s Altogether, the results of the second round
appear in table 4 [next page].

 

5 One was filled in the first round, two others are disputed. Theywould vote on
28 June for one and on 5 July for the other.

‘ Save for error or omission, because I calculated them myself on the basis of
the results published in the press. In this table (just as in table 3), I put
deputy from Polynesia 13: under miscellaneous left. He belonged to the UDF in
the previous legislature, but he seemed to drawIclose to the PS between the two
rounds.

In order to interpret them suitably, account must be taken of the distribution

of candidacies and of desistance agreeaents. I shall do this by confining myself
to metropolitan France. In 10 districts. one single candidate remained in the
race (6 PS. 1 Left Radical, 3 PCF). The evolution of votes was uninteresting there
and it is better to discard then to examine the remaining 310. These included
309 duels and l triangular election (CDS-RPR-PS.‘nas-Rhin 4th district). In the
duels. the PS entered 263 candidates, the NBC 12 and the PCP 34. The RFR entered
I66 and the UDF and the miscellaneous "majority" 145. That explains the very un-
even results of the various parties in table 4. If we regroup by major political
divisions. the evolution of votes between the two rounds (310 districts) is as
follows:

Overall, the decrease in abstentionwcomparable with the decrease observed between
the two roundsof the 1962 legislative election—benefited the right very slightly
more than the left. Actually, 255 of the 309 single candidates of the UM inroved
the total percentage obtained by the right in the first round.

But the left showed that it was very disciplined. although a distinction must be
made depending on the label of the candidate remaining in the race for the runoff:

The socialists practically filled up the left and hardly suffered at all from the
greater participation, while the comunista lost in both areas. But those losses

were light. The socialist voters had the graciouaness not to penalise the PCP
still more.

That kind of discipline led to the election of a new mequalled‘phambex' in which
the PS has, all by itself, an absolute majority, like the UDR in 1968. The fol-
lowing is actually the result in seats:

The changeover, foreseeable on 26 April as a consequence of the double setback
of the Communist Party and of the outgoing president, achieved on 10 May by the
election of 1". Hitterrand and accelerated on 14 June by the socialist upsurge,
was confirmed resoundingly on 21 June. The majority logic of the institutions
of the Fifth Republic entrusted all powers in those who had fought most bitterly.

That kind of victory gave the socialists considerable assets. The most obvious
ones pertain to those institutions guaranteeing the authority and stability of

the new government. But there are others pertaining to the sociology of the voters
and to the renewal of the persons elected. With regard to the sociology of the
voters. Mitterrand stated. very rightlyonthe day of his inauguration. that "the
political majority of the French people have just identified themselves with their
social majority." In fact. the majority of France has been on the left for several
years. owing the deep-seated changes undergone by French society in the last 25
years: urban development. placement on a steady wage. development of the tertiary.
or service, sector. massive entrance of women on the labor market. together with

a school population explosion in secondary and higher education. de-Christianiza-
tion and diffusion of antisuthority ideology in every cell of society. have led

to decisive blows at the traditional social and moral bases of the authority of

the right. To tell the truth. the left probably would have won as early as 1974,
if the haste of the campaign and the changing of the guard within the majority

had not been able to create a belief in change by the center. It would have won

in 1978. if the communist blocking had not prevented it once more.7 The PS. which
gathered 44 percent of the blue-collar votes, 65 percent of the votes of the white-
collar workers and middle level executives and 38 percent of the votes of upper
level executives. became. by far. the dominant party of active France and can base
itself on its representative organization. It is also the party of the youth.
Forty-five percent of persons under 35 years old voted for it on IA June and the
massive entrance of its deputies in the National Assembly made the Assembly's age
drop. He can bet that these young men and these young women will be able to make

a new voice heard there. the voice of their generation.

In contrast with these assets. the risks are also considerable. The vote by the
French people did not sake the restraint. of the international economic situation
disappear. By promising them the early and of unemployment and the high cowt of
living by means of a political change. Candidate Hitterrand certainly did not make
the spirit of responsibility progress much and he did not make a decisive contribu-
tion to democratic education. Undoubtedly. it was good election warfare.

But perhaps there is something more serious. The socialists. who had been ex-
cluded from government authority for too many years. are approaching realities

with the distorted point of view of an ideolgy and a good conscience not very
favorable for calling into question, for fertile doubt. or even for real plural-

ism. By wrongly interpreting the approval vote of the French people as ratifi-
cation of a program that does not have its counterpart in any developed country.

they are running the risk of legislating beyond what is demanded and of setting

up a system too heavy for the nation's vitality. In this connection, the ”sociology"
of the newly elected persons may raise a problem. Roland Cayrol estimated that

58.7 percent of the socialist deputies are educators. The education and profession

of these teachers predispose them still more, unfortunately, to giving precedence
to the system spirit, strengthened by a morality very short of good intentions,

over taking realities into account.‘ If these realities oppose the "immortal prin-
ciples," there will always be some heir of "great ancestors" on the socialist bench
who will advocate flight forward, a break with capitalism and a hunt for scapegosts.
Still deeper than that, France risks going from the disadvantages of an excessive
liberalism to the disadvantages of an equally excessive egalitarianisn. A country

The only protection against these contradictory risks is alternation, or rotation.

without doubt still be necessary tomorrow.
