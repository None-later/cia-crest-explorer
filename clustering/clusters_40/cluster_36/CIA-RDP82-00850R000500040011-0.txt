Austrian Imports From Africa

Austria's purchases from Africa are mainly energy products (77.4 percent), while
10.2 percent include food or parafood products, 5.2 percent are made up of mineral

raw materials, and the remainder involve metals, textile fibers, wood, hides and
leathers and miscellaneous.

Austrian exports to Africa are highly varied, but mainly involve machines and elec-

trical and nonelectrical appliances, textiles and especially unbroidery and trans-
portation equipment (see Table CE-AUT-l [not reproduced]).

Five African suppliers shipped oil to Austria:

 

Tons Hillions of schillings
Libya 1,077,870 4,011.56
Nigeria 470,134 1,659.11
Algeria . 469,569 1,783.11
Egypt 59,146 226.44
Tunisia 19,978 73.51
Total 2,096,696 7,753.73

One can add to these imports of crude oil the 4,990 tons of coal (4.57 million
schillings) from South Africa.

Purchases of food products, generally unprocessed, come in second place with
1.08 billion schillings, including beverages and tobaccos. The five most consonly
imported products were, in declining order: cacao and cacao products, 325 million;

coffe, tea and spices, 255 million; fresh or dried fruits, 192 million; canned
fruits and vegetables, 132 million; and fresh or dried vegetables, 65 million.

The other categories have a market of between 2 or 3 and 15 million schillings.

Over 1.5 Billion Schillings for Nonelectrical Machines

In the sector of nonelectric machines, the largest turnover is in the rather

vague zone that goes from Section 84-56 to the end of Chapter 84 of the Brussels
Nomenclature and that covers: milling, crushing and mixing equipment, cement

mixers, molds, presses, automatic distribution machines, nonspecific machines not
recorded elsewhere and their parts, bits and braces, ball-bearings, metal-plastic

(74.4), Algeria (24.8), Libya (22.3). South Africa (18.3) and Nigeria (7).

Benin and Embroidery From Boralbern

Exports of textile articles come immediately after machines and apparatuses, with
1.82 billion schillings in turnover and are in the lead if one does not regroup
electrical and nonelectrical machines.

It is mainly embroidery work, constituting the specialty of Voralberg Province and
mainly the city of Lustenau, which influences the sector. Table CE-AUT-D [below]
gives sales of products in statistical chapter 58 of the Brussels Nomenclature.

Austrian embroidery work (1,476,600,000 schillings) went almost totally (97.1
percent) to Benin (81.6 percent), Nigeria (8.4 percent) and Togo (7.1 percent).

It is likely that these considerable purchases are not exclusively to cover Benin
or Togolese needs, but could interest the large English-speaking countries nearby.

CBAO LEADERS MEETINGS, JOINT PROJECTS DESCRIBED
Paris MARCHES TROPICAUX ET MEDITERRANEENS in French No 1885. 25 Dec 31 pp 3h05-3h08

[Text] After their ndnistersand experts met on 11 and 12 December, the heads of most
of the French-speaking countries in Heat Africa met in Dakar for 2 days—~Monday and
Tuesday, 14 and 15 December-to study their economic problems with the West African
Economic Community conference, their defense problems with the ANAD [Non-Aggression

and Defense Aid Agreement] conference, and their financial problems with the UMOA
[West African Monetary Union] conference.

Although no unforeseen decision was made during the CEAO and the ANAD conferences,
on the other hand, an apparently unexpected decision was announced after the UMDA
conference, the decision /not to admit Mali/ - for the time being -- /to the UMOA/
[in boldface].

However, Mali's admission seemed to have been won, due to the extensive work which
had prepared the way for Mali's integration into the UMOA zone, an integration with
complex and difficult problems.

It would have been Upper Volta's vote which would have prevented Mali from using the
CPA franc, and this veto would have political reasons, not economic ones. The border
conflict which has set Upper Volta against Mali several times over the past years is
recalled. For Upper Volta, this conflict has not been settled and Colonel Saye
Zerbo, president of the Republic of Upper Volta would therefore have required reso-
lution of his border conflict with Mali before agreeing to Mali's entry into the
UMOA.

Officially, the conference of the heads of state requested "extended deliberation in
order to make subsequent decision," as the conference's final communique indicates.

At the end of the three Dakar conferences, it appeared that:

- the CEAO is progressing on schedule and the large community projects will be
achieved little by little;

- the ANAD will be "launched," the heads of state having signed the protocol for its
application and adopted the general secretariat'a general organizational structure
and the distribution of positions;

- the UMOA remains we11-established, with its two basic institutions, the BCEAO
[Central Bank of the West African States] and the BOAD [West African Development
Bank].

On the other hand, the desire for an ever more active solidarity among the member
states must be stressed, a solidarity whose foundations are at once cultural, due

to use of the French language; monetary, due to the CPA franc; and historical, due

to former membership in the A0? [French West Africa] Federation. However, West
Africa's three community organizations do not exactly include all the countries which
are represented as follows:

CEAO ANAD UMQA
Senegal X X X
Mauritania X X
Mali X X
Niger X X X
Upper Volta X X X
Ivory Coast X X X
Benin x
Togo X X

Benin and Togo are not members of the CEAO, but do have observer status. It will be
noted that Guinea is the only one of the eight former members of the AC? who does
not belong to any of the three organizations.

The presidency of the CEAO and of the UMOA for 1982 have been entrusted again to Mr
Abdou Diouf, president of the Republic of Sengal, while General Eyadema, president
of the Republic of Togo, has been made president of the ANAP.

In regard to the CEAO, whose development involves not only the enterprises of member
countries, but also European enterprises which night invest in West Africa, we are
presenting the large community projects as they were finalized for the Dakar con-
ference.

The interest which financial institutions specializing in aid to African countries
have in the CEAO must also be stressed and was confirmed by the arrival in Dakar of
abOut 10 of their directors, invited to speak at the opening session: Messrs David
Knox, vice president of the World Bank; Edgard Pisani, development commissioner for
the EEC; Ahmed Mohamed Ali, president of the Islamic Development Bank; Chedly Ayari,
president of the Arab Bank for African Economic Development; Donatien Bihute, vice
president of the African Development Bank; Chihata, general manager of the special
fund of OPEC; Bertin Berna, regional representative of the UN Development Program;
Rolland-Billecart, general manager of the Central Fund for Economic Cooperation;
Badel A1 Humaidi, general manager of the Kuwaiti Fund; Al Ambari, president of the
Iraqi Fund; J. Dromer, president of the International Bank for West Africa (the only
private establishment invited to the CEAO conference, due to its specialization in
African affairs).

As we reported, a meeting of CEAO donors took place in Ougadougou from 12 to 14
October last year to examine community projects and the 45 billion CPA francs in
financing expected to secure their achievement.1

CEAO Community Projects

Established by the fourth summit at Bamako in October 1987, the large community
projects were classified "priority actions for integration and economic development"

by the sixth conference of the heads of state of the community held in Niamey in
October 1980.

They involve the following seven projects: (1) village and rural water program;

(2) CESAG [African Center for Advanced Management Studies]; (3) a community corpora-
tion for outfitting ships, purchasing and marketing fish products; (4) ISSTH [Advanced
Institute of Halieutic Science and Technology]; (5) EMIG [School of Mining and Geology];

(6) ESITEX [Advanced School of Textile Industries]; (7) CRES [Regional Solar Energy
Center].

FOSIDEC [Fund for Solidarity and Intervention for the Development of the Community],
also established at the fourth summit, has as its mission to contribute to the economic
and social development of the six member states of the CEAO and, as such. it partici-
pates in the achievement of the large projects.

1) Village and Rural Water Program

Village water programs seem more and more to be an essential prerequisite to any
planning for rural development, especially in the countries of the Sahel. Their
justification basically resides in the improvement of sanitary conditions and water
supply. Furthermore, the significant time savings over the traditional method of
providing water to rural communities can be profitably used for an economic or educa-
tional activity.

The aim of the CEAO program is not only completion of 2,63b water sources in the six
countries of the community to assure water supply to the most disadvantaged areas.
but also training and encouraging the villagers in maintenance of the water system,
especially of drill holes and wells.

The distribution of projects by country is as follows: Ivory Coast: 300 productive
drill holes; Upper Volta: 320 productive drill holes, 406 wells; Mali: 250 produc-
tive drill holes, 250 wells; Mauritania: 120 productive drill holes, 2&4 wells;
Niger: 100 productive drill holes, 400 pump wells; Senegal: 125 productive drill
holes, 125 wells.

Furthermore, the CEAO program aims. through training or continuing education, to train
national managers in the areas of drilling, hydrogeology and geophysics.

2) School of Mining and Geology (EMIC). Location: Niamey (Republic of Niger)

The School of Mining and Geology will have three principal activities: training of
engineers, continuing education, applied research.

POSIDEC is distinct from the PCB [Community Development Fund] which must provide
compensation for losses on import receipts submitted by member state», due to the
application of preferential tariff rates in the CEAO zone.

FOSIDEC is a specialized financial institution created on 28 October 1978 by the member
states of the CEAO and given financial autonomy and legal status. As of 31 December
1981, its endowment amounted to 9,500 million CPA francs, with 7,275 invested.

Its role is both that of a guaranty fund and a financial development institution.
Protocol "M" which contains POSIDEC's articles defines five types of Pund activity:

guarantee and counter-signing of loans; financing community and company studies within
the Community; subsidies; granting loans; investment.

The Fund can guarantee loans for a total amount equal to 10 times its guaranty funds
as of the date of its involvement. Investment income, after deduction of the Fund's

operating expenses, is intended for the financing of studies and for interest subsidy
in the form of repayable grants.

POSIDEC can act in all areas of economic activity: industry, agriculture, animal
husbandry, fishing, conmnrce, transportation and commmnications, infrastructures,
tourism, social programs, etc.

POSIDEC acts for the benefit of: member states of the CEAO, public individuals from
these states, private individuals from these states, on the condition that the head-
quarters and the principal field of activity be located in one of the member states
and that the majority of the capital belong to nationals of the aforesaid states;
individuals of one of the six nationalities of the member states. Particular attention
is granted to small and middle-size businesses.

In its actions, POSIDEC gives priority to regional projects (involving several states)
and to those originating in the least industrialized states.

From May 1979, date of establishment of the Fund's basic organization, to 30 April

1981, FOSIDEC has been involved in 21 projects, representing an overall commitment
distributed as follows: guarantee and countersigning, 6,760 million CPA francs;
financing of studies, 142.3 million CPA francs; interest subsidy, 63 million CPA francs.

- Preliminary training of engineers. In 5 years, the school will train engineers for
mining, geological prospecting and processing of ores.

- Continuing education. The school has two types of activity: first of all, in
cooperation with the profession, organizing cycles or stages of continuing education
lasting from several days to several weeks open to both engineers and advanced tech-
nicians or persons with similar training and several years professional experience
(4 to 5 years minimum) the opportunity to obtain an engineering degree (after having
proved their intellectual capability through appropriate testing).

- Applied research. This should enable establishment of data and information on the
industrial and administrative level.

Depending on the date of the school's opening, it should promote 30 to 40 engineering
students and 50 to 60 advanced technicians.

Recruiting qualifications are defined as follows: for engineers: science degree
required with distinction or at least a good academic record; length of program:

5 academic years; for advanced technicians: science degree: length of program: 3
academic years.

- Cost of the EMIG; 7 to 8 billion CPA francs, or 150 million French francs, or
$25 million.

3) Advanced Institute of Halieutic Science and Technology [ISSTH] Location:
Nouadhibou (Islamic Republic of Mauritania).

The Institute is intended to give the countries of the Community management personnel
with special training adapted to the conditions for exploring, developing and managing
fish, ocean and mainland resources. Training will have two advanced cycles (engineers
and technicians). It will be based on a minimum of applied research. The Institute
sh0uld also plan for a program intended to train consulting engineers and organize
courses or stages for continuing education.

- Direct recruitment. The Institute will provide training at two levels: (1) advanced
fishing technicians, holders of the baccalaureat or equivalent degree, length of
program: 3 academic years; (2) fishing engineers, recruited at the end of the first
university cycle (DUES or equivalent), length of program: 3 academic years.

- Recruiting by professional examination. The Institute's board of directors will
determine the procedure.

- Recruiting by title. Agricultural engineers and water and forestry engineers or
holders of equivalent degree.

- Level of recruiting. Fishing engineers: 20 per year; advanced technicians: 30
to 40 per year.

- Cost of the project (1981 revised estimate): 2 billion CPA francs, or 40 million
French francs or $7 million.

4) Community corporation for outfitting ships, purchasing and marketing fish products.
Location: Nouadhibou (Islamic Republic of Mauritania).

The member states of the CEAO, on the whole, are profitting very little from the
potential of the waters which border their coasts. The planned corporation will be
intended especially to help these countries to achieve self-sufficiency in food
supply and to remedy the Community's malnutrition problems. The insufficiency of
animal protein for human consumption in the sub-region is estimated at 285,000 metric
tons in 1980 and 500,000 for the year 2000.

The community corporation has assigned itself as goals:

- reduction of the insufficiency of animal protein in the human diet by going from

16 g/day to 30 g/day per inhabitant in areas where there is no fish. (Installation
of a cold line in addition to a pilot operation for meat and fowl, fruits and
vegetables, and dairy products);

- contributing to making the freezer plants in Nouadhibou, Dakar and Abidjan pro-
fitable;

- contributing to stimulation of the fishing industry by: distribution of wages and
income; currency savings for importers; conversion of fishing licenses often granted
to foreign ships without subsequent economic reprisals; possibilities of new oppor-

tunities for shipping lines established and national fleets; transfer of technology;
other induced effects.

- Three roles: outfitting (establishing a fleet), plants (refrigeration - shops -
offices), marketing (purchasing, sales of fresh. frozen and other processed fish).

- Planned agreement: ships' flags and registry; tax and duty rates; fishing limits
and laws; creation of jobs.

5) Advanced School of Textile Industries [ESITEX]

The mission of ESITEX, a specialized CEAO institution, is to train and adapt to the
labor market management and advanced technicians for the textile industries. ESITEX,
which will open its doors in October 1983 in Segou, Mali, will not only train engi-
neers, advanced technicians and foremen, but will also provide continuing education
for textile industry personnel.

One of the characteristics of this establishment will be applied research and assis-
tance to industry through an ever more active role as consulting engineer to textile
manufacturers. The length of training is 5 years for engineers and 2 years for
advanced technicians; training is both scientific and technical.

- Cost of the Project: 4.4 billion CPA francs.

6) African Center for Advanced Management Studies [CESAG]
Location: Dakar (Senegal).

CESAG is an advanced study, poet-graduate, bilingual center with a regional and an
African role. CESAG will provide training and continuing education to all managers
and executives with the ability and the aptitude required to lead companies and
administrations in the countries of the sub-region.

CESAG will contribute its support to other institutions in the sub-region and will
also benefit from the exchange of information which will be set up. It will organize
research and proceed with studies on the concrete problems of companies in the para-
public private sector as well as in the public sector, to find practical and opera-
tional solutions. It will verify the feasibility of the solutions proposed in the
field after studying the cases and precise diagnosis of specific situations.

The role of adviser to companies will assure the link between the reality of manage-
ment in the field and the training given at the Center.

- Two stage process. The first stage is constituted by the £562 [Senegal Advanced
School of Enterprise bhnagement]; the second stage: extending the structure and
the goals (educational content, cycles and training models) activities and admini-
stration to the member states of CEAO and CILSS [Inter-State Committee to Fight the
Drought in the Sahel].

7) Regional Solar Energy Center [CRES]
Location: Bamako (Mali)

The CRES is aimed at: providing training for the necessary staff, centralizing
information on energy problems and handling its distribution, developing applied
research in solar energy as well as in other renewable forms of energy, promoting
new energy projects through study and engineering, designing and producing solar
equipment on the industrial level which responds to the needs of member countries

of the CEAO and the CILSS, actively participating in the development of international
and regional African cooperation in the area of renewable energy, and participating
in the drafting of an overall energy strategy for the member countries of the CEAO
and the CILSS.

The production division will be principally directed towards three fields of activity
of vital importance to rural populations: equipping water sources "ith solar pumps
(1 kw) for village (human and animal) water systems; irrigation and agricultural
development (using 10 kw pumps); water management in general.

Production will also assure: preservation of foodstuffs by solar drying and refri-
geration; heating water for multiple family uses and for health establishments
(hospitals, dispensaries, maternity wards, etc,); cooking food; the struggle against
the drying up of the Sahel countries whose energy needs are currently 75 percent
satisfied by wood fuel.

Training will be provided for technicians, applications engineers and researchers
called upon to assure the transfer of foreign technical assistance within the regional
center. A campaign to inform the people and make them aware of solar energy and
other sources of renewable energy will be implemented gradually.

Cost of the CRBS: 8.4 billion CPA francs, or 168 million French francs or $29 million.
Financial Costs of the Projects

- Debt costs. Debt service for all seven projects (including the village and rural
water program) ranges from 667 million CFA francs for the first years (198‘ to 1986)
to 1,761 million CPA francs for the highest year (1990). In current franc value,
the cost for the project years is around 1,600 million CPA francs.

Considering inflation rates, debt costs will go down and their coverage should not
constitute a major problem for the organization.

- Operational expenses. The total operating expenses for all of the projects are
still poorly defined, with certain items remaining to be clarified, particularly
since the problem )f these expenses comes up in 1985.

On the other hand, it must be stressed that all the projects have been revised down—
ward and the reduction of the projects (particularly EH16, ISSTH and BSITEX) will
result in a concomitant reduction in their operating expenses.

It is actually certain that if the countries pay their dues to the community develop-
ment fund on schedule, a significant percentage of the recurring charges for the
projects will be covered.

Between now and 1985, it will be possible to investigate other existing possibilities:
reduction of operating costs; financing by outside technical assistance donors;
participation by financing sources in operating expenses (replacing equipment, scholar-
ships. technical assistance); participation of professional users (industries involved);
partial allocation by the countries of the state technical training tax paid by the
industries which are benefiting.

SENEGAL-ANGOLA RAPPROCHEHENT BECOMES APPARENT
Paris JEUNE AFRIQUE in French No 1094, 23 Dec 81 p 24
[Article by Sylviane Kamara]

[Text] The Senegalese are keeping quiet about it. The Angolan: are mum. But
the Cape Verdians have spilled the beans by announcing the hmminent normaliza-
tion of relatknsbetween Dakar and Luanda. They were in a good position to do
so: it was in Praia. while both were visiting Cape Verde, that Presidents Abdou
Diouf and Jose Eduardo dos Santos met on 24 November. Up to now. Senegal has
been the only country in Africa that has not recognized the legitimacy of the
government in Angola. This was because of the Cuban presence and because
neither UNITA nor the FNLA were represented in the government.

Senegal owes this rejectionist policy to its former president, Leopold Senghor.
At the OAU special summit on Angola (held in Addis Ababa 10-13 January 1976),
Mr Senghor was the leader of the anti-HPLA faction which was demanding a cease-
fire, the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the formation of a government of
national unity. Mr Senghor based his support for the UNITA-FNLA forces on the
conclusions of the factfinding commission sent by the OAU in 1975. The latter,
in trying to assess the representativeness of the three respective movements,
had concluded that UNITA controlled the most populous regions. Hr Senghor was
also hostile to what he called the "Cuban expedition“ and determined to do his
best to struggle against the spread of communism in Africa.

It was he who. just before the MPLA's victory, succeeded in convincing France
and the United States to provide aid to UNITA and the PNLA. The Senegalese
president thought he could count on the support of the 22 countries who had
supported his resolution in Addis. All of them. however, recognized Angola.
which became the 47th member state of the OAU on 23 February 1976, including
Senegal [as published]. But President Senghor himself. despite pressure from
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, refused to enter into diplomatic relations with the

HPLA government.

To those who warned him to beware of the USSR's reactions. Hr Senghor answered
that no one would ever get anything out of him with threats. Some thought they
saw in the head of state's stubbornness the effects of a personal grudge against
Agostinho “etc. A literary enmity? In any case Mr Senghor always took pains

to praise Hr Neto's literary gifts, both publicly and privately. But he

18
FOR 0FF“JAl.USE(MVLY

criticized him for being unwilling to enter into a dialogue. In 1977. he said
to JEUNE AFRLQUE: "My Impression is that the Soviets themselves would not be
displeased to see a dialogue between Savimbi and Neto." Not everyone agrees
with that. Shortly before his death. Agostinho Neto. in a message to a West
African president. expressed his desire to make peace with UNITA. Some time
afterward. Neto went to the USSR for medical treatment. and we know the result.

The question we face now is: Does the expected normalization of relations between
Angola and Senegal mean that the HPLA is prepared to negotiate with UNITA? Jonas
Savimbi himself said in Hashington on 10 December that he would be willing to
talk when the Cuban troops have left the country. President Abdou Diouf seems

to be in more of a hurry. He intends to reconsider Senegal's position in light
of the "unacceptable conduct of South Africa in southern Africa. launching
attacks against Angola on a daily basis." No one, he says. can stand by and

just watch this happen. Dakar. then, is going to recognize the HPLA's Angola.
without any reservations or prerequisites. for Pretoria's ties with UNITA are
well known. Our special correspondent. Sennen Andriamirado observed in December
that Dakar still sheltered a UNITA bureau. Hr Diouf's response was: "Yes. we
have a bureau. For the moment."

MONETARY REVIEH OF UMOA OFFERED
Paris MARCHES TROPICAUX ET MEDITERRANEZNS in French No 1887v8 Jan 82 p 77

(Text? The BCEAO [ﬁentral Bank of the West African State§7 recently pub-
lished its periodical statement on the monetary situation of the UHOA [Fest
African chetary Union/, this time as of 30 June 1981.‘

In the gloomy international economic environment of the first quarter of
1981, during which prices for major staple products exported by countries
of the union to world markets deteriorated, the monetary situation of the
six states (Benin, Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, Niger, Senegal and Togo) was
marked by a strong deterioration of the net external balance of their mone-
tary institutions, a drop in growth of internal credit, and a slowdown in
the rate of increase of the money supply.

From 30 June 1980 to 30 June 1981, the net debit position of the union's
external assets went from -CFA 210.8 billion to -CFA 380.1 billion, thus
showing a decrease in assets of 169.3 billion.

The principal cause of deterioration in the net external position of UHOA
lies in considerable deficits in the balance of goods and services owing
to the rise in costs of imports, and to increasingly heavy service expend-
itures by certain states.

The Ivory Coast and Senegal were at the base of that considerable deficit,
for the negative balance of settlements made by those states with the ex-
terior rested, respectively, at 195.6 billion and 45.8 billion as of 30
June 1981, compared to 1h2.? and 3“.5 billion a year earlier.

The growth of the deficit recorded by the Ivory Coast is explained essen-
tially on the one hand by the fall in earnings from coffee and cocoa exports
owing to the unfavorable price level and to the reduced volume marketed,

and secondly by an increase in the value of imports and transfers abroad,
particularly under the heading of debt service.

In Senegal, the increased imbalance of commercial payments is at the root
of recorded foreign exchange losses.

20
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
In Benin and Togo, a reversal of the negative external balance of payments
was recorded.

In Upper Volta, the surplus attained by the start of the period under re-
view was strengthened to the figure of 5.9 billion, owing particularly to
repatriation of savings by Upper Voltan workers abroad.

In Niger, the negative balance of foreign operations decreased markedly, to
stand at 5.2 billion. This lightening of the deficit could be the result
or drawings on foreign loans. and of income from uranium sales.

Between 30 June 1980 and 30 June 1981, domestic credit rose by CI! Fr 206.7
billion, or 15.7 percent, a rate in decline compared to that of 26.7 percent
recorded for the prior 12-month period. That decrease was due solely to
credit extensions to the economy, for the net creditor position of local
treasuries vis-a-vis monetary institutions strongly deteriorated.

The creditor position of treasuries, in overall figures, went from CPA Fr
+82.) billion on 30 June 1980 to +2.2 billion on 30 June 1981. Decline of
available credit was appreciable in the Ivory Coast (-50.6 billion) and
Niger (-12.7 billion). The debit position of the Senegalese treasury wor-
sened to reach #1 billion, a rise of 13.2 billion.

Credits to the economy Outstanding on 50 June 1981 represented CFA Fr 1,528.2
billion, an increase of 126.7 billion over 1980, a percentage rise of 9
compared to 17.7 for the prior year. Union monetary authorities have adop-
ted a more moderate credit policy, and the slowdown of credit demand was
general, with the exception of Upper Volta. In the Ivory Coast and Senegal,
the slowdown was less marked, with respective rates of +10.# percent and
+10.6 percent. In Niger and Togo, the annual credit growth rate fell, res-
pectively, from #8.? percent and 12.9 percent to 0.8 percent and 6 percent.

Prom 30 June 1980 to 30 June 1981, bills and money in circulation increased
from CFA Fr 505.6 billion to 350.2 billion. Togo and the Ivory Coast regis-
tered the greatest increases: 16.1 and 13.8 percent, respectively. The vol-
ume of bank deposits (sight and time) by the private sector increased, in
the 12-mcnth period from June 1980 to June 1981, by 28.1 percent, totaling
CPA Fr 60?.) billion. The improvement comes to 5.5 percent in Senegal and
7.1 percent in Upper Volta. It is less than 5 percent in the other states.
By states, the distribution of private sector bank deposits (sight and time)
as of 30 June 1981 was as follows, in billions of CFA Fr: Benin, 29.2; Ivory
Coast, 393.2; Upper Volta, 39.3; Niger, 40.7; Senegal, 123.6;“and Togo, 36. .

For the same period, bank deposits by public entities decreased from CEA.Fr
103.5 to 81.5 billion, a 22 percent drop. The decrease was particularly
marked in the Ivory Coast (17.2 percent) and Senegal (6 percent).

there was an increase in the proportion of credit refinanced. In Niger and
Togo it remained at approximately 1? and 15 percent, respectively, while in
Upper Volta and Benin there was a decrease.

From one year to the next there was an increased tightening oz‘ liquid bank
assets following the slowdown in deposit building by individuals and enter-
prises. A de icit resulted, which was financed by increased recourse by
banks 'to borrowing abroad. Banknote issues by the Institute to meet the
deficit rose from CPA Fr 597.5 billion to 506.3, 3 27.# percent increase.

POLITICAL, ECWNIC REVIEW OF 1981 GIVEN
Paris MARCHE'S TROPICAUX ET EDITERRANEEmS in French No 1887, 8 Jan 82 p 59

Ziex§7 The political and economic movements which during 1981 marked the
African continent and each of its countries are now, as they are each year,
the subject of an overview whose publication we begin today. It concerns
the internal history of Africa, which cannot, obviously, be separated from
its world environment. Africa has felt directly, and probably with greater
impact than other continents, the repercussions of the recession in inter-
national trade, of a strengthened protectionism on the part of industrial
powers in forms more or less disguised, of the increased cost of petroleum--
at least to non-producing coantries, of the instability of exchange rates,
of the rise in interest rates, and finally of the stagnation of prices for
raw materials and staple products.

To those external factors which have influenced African development are ad-
ded internal factors which have been examined, for sub-Saharan African coun-
tries, in the study conducted by a group of World Bank experts and known as
the Berg report (see MTH for 13 Nov 1981, p 2863 et seq), which recommended
easing of exchange rates and elimination of obstacles to exports--that is,
trade liberalization.

The World Bank approach differs from that of the Lagos action plan adopted
by the OAU in that the latter, which concerns the entire continent, aims at
the economic independence of Africa through self-sufficiency thanks to the
use of its internal resources, whereas the World Bank advocates development
through increased trade in a market economy. The World Bank is thus led to
advise development of export crops, and to minimize the role of industrial-
ization. The Lagos plan, on the contrary, considers that an agricultural
exports policy leads to economic dependence, and that Africa must put an
end to a situation in which it is content to export its raw materials and
import the manufactured products it needs. It thus considers it necessary
to favor creation of local industries, particularly those based on proces-
sing of agricultural products, and consequently gives the same priority to

levels which are some day--by the end of the century--to eventuate in inte-
gration of the entire continent.

The quite recent agreement signed in Lusaka concerning the eastern and sou-
thern African preferential zone, and the projected extension of the central
African customs and economic union, reflect this policy of creating large
regional and sub-regional groupings, of which CEAO and ECGHAS are already

encouraging examples, and which appear more and more necessary in interna-
tional relations.

The combination of those external and internal factors brought about in
1981, for Africa as a whole, a reduction in its gr055'economic product es-
timated at 5 percent by Adebayo Adedeji, executive secretary of the UN
Economic Commission for Africa, in a statement at year's end in Addis Ababa.
H Adedeji calculated Africa's 1981 growth rate at between 2 and 3 percent,
compared to # percent in 1980, and he thinks food production per capita
must have continued to decline, as it has for 6 years, at the rate of 1 per-
cent per year. The value of Africa's exports was affected by the shrinking
of demand by industrialized countries, and in 1981 represented but 828 bil-
lion, or 81.8 billion less than the year before. The balance of payments
deficit, however, cannot have risen by much in view of the stagnation of
imports at etc billion.

Politically, Africa was directly concerned by the coming to power of Mr
Reagan, who assumed office at the start of 1981, and of h Hitterand at mid-
year. Departing from the policy of his predecessor, the new President of
the United States defined a strategy towards the Third World which tends to
include it in the rivalry between the two superpowers, and thus to privilege
states considered the most faithful allies of the West, especially if they
enjoy a strategic position considered essential; while at the same time re-
serving a more considerable role for the private sector in development,

even to the point of reducing, in real terms, the bilateral aid extended

by the United States and its participation in multilateral aid.

Hith France, the question is not so much a break in aid to development--
which has always been a constant of French policy-~as one of strengthening
such aid, which is to double in volume during the septennate, and one of
reorientation. The new French president indeed resolutely intends to take
the lead among industrialized nations in North-South negotiations, both for
reasons of equity and because Third World development seems to him the best,
if not the only path leading out of the world crisis.

He perfectly summed up his philosophy in his address opening the conference
of developing countries, with the phrase: "To help the Third World is to
help oneself.“ That is the thesis he defended at the summit of the seven
most industrialized countries in Ottawa on 20-21 July 1981, and at that of
Cancun 22-23 October 1981, which joined together industrialized and devel-
oping countries. President Reagan finally eased his position, and the
United States has accepted resumption of global negotiations, provided two

conditions are met which are stated in the final declaration: a mutually
acceptable base, and reasonable chances of achieving significant gains.

Despite the globalist character stamped on French cooperation and develop-
ment policy, Africa as a whole will continue to find in France a partner
which considers the whole range of its relationships with the continent as
privileged. This is particularly true of the 21 states which are among
the least advanced, and for whose benefit France has decided to make an
exceptional effort. It must be equally so for the continent as a whole,
as has been declared on several occasions by the minister of development
and cooperation.

SOUTH AFRICAN METHODS OBSERVED IN PETRANGOL ATTACK
Paris AFRIQUE-ASIE in French ho 255, 21 Dec 81 pp 10-11
[Report from AFRIQUEFASIE'S Luanda correspondent, Achille Lollo]

[Text] lPretoria's aim, and one supported by the Reagan administration. is to
bring the state and people of Angola to their knees./ [in italics]

On the night of 30 November a commando team of white mercenaries s cceeded in
getting onto the premises of PETRANGOL [Angola Petroleum Company], on the pro-
montory behind the port, in the northern outskirts of Luanda.

Between midnight and 0100. the fuel depots (gasoline, fuel-oil. diesel oil,
and so on) were blown up with high explosives. Towering flames spread, illu-
minating the sky with glimmering orange. The fire, fortunately, was brought
under control rather quickly, thanks to the prompt intervention of service
workers and the police forces. So the main part of the refinery as well as
the other depots and the gasometers were spared. They should have blown up,
too: high-powered hollow charges had been placed at every strategic point in
the refinery complex. But the mercenaries‘ plan had gone wrong.

In fact, the first alarm was sounded even before the explosion. Security per-
sonnel had detected the presence of the commando team on the premises. The
mercenary group was just on the point of connecting the charges to each other

so that the explosions would occur almost simultaneously. The 24 explosions
planned would have disemboweled the complex and set off a huge fire. however.
the sounding of the alarm did not rout the commandoes, or at least their leader,
who went ahead to make the electric contact and blow up the depots. He may have
hoped that the incompletely fused charges would be set off as the flames spread,
or at least hoped that the fire would spread to the points where crude oil is
brought into the refinery. The result would have been close enough to the
original plan. particularly since the high temperature could also have caused
the gasometers to explode. whatever resulted from that desperate move. once

the mission was accomplished he could have earned the reward that professionals
of his ilk usually receive. But the sense of "duty" to be carried out certainly
made him forget that four of his accomplices were still at work close to the
depot. Two of them, hit with the full force of the explosion, were torn to

shreds, and a few bits of flesh was all that the Angolan forces found when
they arrived. The pools of blood left by the other two, who were seriously
wounded, marked the trail which led from the refinery to the coast. Below,
near the place where the rubber dinghy had waited for the commando team. some
military materiel, radios of South African origin, some other mines, detona-
tors, and backpacks full of ammunition, as well as various sabotage devices.
had been abandoned. Regaining the South African submarine which in all
probability was waiting offshore. the commando team, which had taken care to
re-embark its wounded, vanished into the night. It was a spectacular effort.
carried out with sophisticated means. A foretaste of this had been given 2
weeks previously. on 13 N0vember, with the sabotage of the beacons that mark
the channel of the Mozambican port of Beira. There again, it certainly seems
that the special commando team had been brought to the site in a Daphne—class*
submarine. The South African army has several of them. and they are, among
other things, used to maintain watch over the route around the Cape, the famous
"oil road." It would seem that the two operations. at Beira and Luanda, were
led by officers of South African military intelligence who, from their sub-
mersible command post, guided the commando team made up of South Africans and
British and American mercenaries. The investigation that followed the opera-
tion against the refinery in the Angolan capital has reportedly established the
fact that the Scuth African submarine got underway from the port of Halvis Bay
on the night of 26-27 November. From there. the submarine went directly up the
"cold Benguela current" which funnels into the mouth of the Bengo River near
the bay of Luanda and is believed to have taken a position just off the deserted
and rocky coast opposite the natural park of Cacuaco. Then the rubber dinghy
carried the dozen members of the commando team to a point quite close to the
refinery. The Angolan army has accumulated a good deal of experience with
this kind of thing over the last 6 years: the operation was similar to those
undertaken by South African commandoes in southern Angola. The structure of
the commando team was typical: a navigator to steer the boat, a communications
technician remaining on board, a third man responsible for protection. The two

mercenaries who were to cut the barbed wire and protective wire netting were

then to remain poaitionea to keep guard on this passage leading to the refinery.

As for the saboteurs, there were six men armed with pistols. each carrying two
military backpacks containing mines, detonators and other paraphernalia. and
another. armed with an automatic pistol fitted with a silencer. who led the way

to the installations and who was to have covered the retreat.

The head of the group was responsible for seeing that the charges were laid at
the strategic points and maintaining contact with the boat and the two men who
remained outside the facility. Divided into three groups, the saboteurs laid
the charges in three areas of the refinery proper, the gasometers (for liquid
butane gas). the depots where gasoline. fuel oil and so on were stored--some

of which did in fact explode--the oil pumping nad distribution stations and the
refinery tanks. If the operation had gone off as the ID (Intelligence Depart-
ment of the South African army) had planned. the densely populated areas sur—
rounding the refinery-particularly Sambizanga, Boa Vista and Hiramar—-as well

as the port,* the Malange railroad terminal, which is quite close, and a number
of factories located in this industrial zone would have succumbed to the flames.
This is the considered opinion of the experts from Mobil Oil. Chevron. Total
and Texaco. whose respective depots are also close to the refinery. A Belgian
technician could not help admitting, even though he does not profess "any
Leftist ideology, that this kind of thing turns my stomach. The South Africans
could have killed all of us. and also the people who live nearby. They are
assassins." All of the personnel of these companies are convinced that the ex—
plosion could have been much greater because of the hollow charges utilized.
The shockwave they would have produced if they had all exploded simultaneously
would have turned the gasometers themselves into gigantic bombs with an effect
comparable to that of hundreds of phosphorous bombs.

That act of undeniable "economic sabotage coumdtted by South Africa,“ it was
termed by Pedro Van Dunenem, the minister of petroleum and energy, one of the
Angolan leaders who accompanied President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to the scene
barely an hour after the fire, fits perfectly into the strategy of Operation
Proteus 1981 and is a logical sequel. For, beyond the incalculable damage and
carnage which the total destruction of the refinery would have caused, the in-
terruption of the refining activity would doubtless have had repercussions on
the readiness of the Angolan army. which would have been deprived of fuel pro-
visioning. The [Angolan] counteroffensive to dislodge the racist occupiers in
the southern provinces of Cunene and Kuando Kubango would likely have been
neutralized. The South African army would have been able to profit from this
situation by launching a new attack in the north. near Xangongo and Cahama.

In economic terms, it is easy to imagine the consequences of the refinery's
destruction: 1.25 million tons of its refined oil products are destined each
year for domestic consumption.

In a word, Pretoria's aims, and one which has the blessings of the Reagan Ad-
ministration, is to bring the Angolan state and people to their knees.

BURUNDI

PRESIDENT JEAN-BAPTISTE BAGAZA INTERVIEW!)
P11171435 Paris JEUNE AFRIQUB in French 3 Feb 82 pp 32-33

[Interview with Burundi President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza by Jacques Gautrand and
Hamza Kaidi: "A Very Prudent President"-date and place of interview not given]

[Excerpts] He had just turned 30. At that age, when many people have still not
found their way in life, he took charge of his country's destiny. It was

1 November 1976. His name: Jean-Baptiste Bagaza. His country: Burundi.
27,000 sq km, hemmed in by Zaire. hands and Tanzania.

Colonel Began, who is an affable man renowned for his austerity and his enthu-
siasm for work, does not revel in slogans or ready-made formulas.

If he is asked: "Would you class Burundi among the progressive or moderate
countries?" he replies: "A regime is not progressive because it places itself
in a particular camp or because it votes in a particular way in international
bodies. It is progressive by virtue of its internal policy and its attitude

toward its people. "

As regards internal policy, President Bagaza has restructured the administration

and purged it or corrupt elements. Outdated or unpopular laws, like ubuger
ergwa (a sort of bondage contractbinding peasants, and even their descendants,

to landowners) have been abrogated; a tax dating from colonial times (a poll

tax levied on every adult Burundi male, whatever his income) has been abolished.
"In 5 years," President Bagaza says, "many things have changed. many more than we
had expected. The cost of changing structures and men is high and the people
were not prepared. The Burundians understood. however. and followed us."

Political life in Burundi is dominated by a single party. UPRONA (Unity and
National Progress). whose central committee has since December 1979 held all the
powers previously exercised by the Supreme Revolutionary Council. But in

November 1981 a new constitution, which makes provision for the election of a
National Assembly, was adopted. And, something quite rate in single-party systems,
Burundians who are not members of UPRONA can stand for election.

[Question] What will happen if they get more votes than UPRONA candidates?

31
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

"In that case the party would have to reform itself or disappear," President
Bagaza said.

[Question] Is that not contrary to the ethos of the single party?

[Answer] No, because a single party must be seen in terms of the evolution of
peoples. In our country there were initially about 30 political formations which
disappeared gradually, the number falling to four, then two. Only UPRONA survived.
He do not necessarily want a single—party system; above all we want the people

to be able to express their wishes. If UPRONA were to become a bureaucratic party,
it would be a sectarian formation which people would leave. [Answer ends]

As far as major inter-African or international problems are concerned. the
Burundi president observes a policy of strict nonalignment. In 1978, shortly
after the second invasion of Shaba Province by "Katangan ex-gendarmes," he
refused to lend his support to the formation of a common army by a few African
countries. "Burundi is not hostile to the creation of an inter—African army but
to certain regional pacts which could turn against another part of Africa. It
cannot, therefore, involve itself in any military organization whatsoever.
Conversely, we are favorably disposed to a truly inter—African force as soon as
such a force is possible technically and financially and on the condition that it
is accepted by the government requesting its creation."

[Question] But you condoned the Libyan intervention in Chad.

[Answer] We condoned it because Libya intervened at the request of the Chad
Government. It stopped the bloodshed and enabled peace to be restored. Moreover
we knew that the Libyans would withdraw from Chad as soon as the authorities

of that country asked them to. [Answer ends]

The president was equally noncommittal with respect to the two great powers:
"The era of the cold war is over as there is more consultation than confrontation
between the United States and the USSR these days."

Relations with France are cordial. 0n the fringe of the November 1981 summit
meeting between the African and French heads of state, Colonel Bagaza met with
Francois Mitterrand and also Claude Cheysson and Jean-Pierre Cot, minister of
external relations and minister in charge of cooperation and development respec-
tively. "Since the French socialists came to power," he said, "the style has
changed and there is unquestionably a will to improve and diversify France's
cooperation relations with African countries.

"But the interests and imperatives of French policy remain unchanged," he
hastened to add. "Although we feel that President Hitterrand's government
really does understand African problems. we do not think that he has the means
to solve them in view of the current world situation."

At the regional level Burundi is striving to maintain relations of good neighborb
liness and cooperation. Like Zaire and Rwanda, it is a member of the Economic
Community of the Great Lakes Countries (CEPGL), which is running out of steam
somewhat. With Tanzania and Rwanda, joined recently by Uganda, it is participa-
ting in the organization of the development of the Kagera Basin.

[Question] Is it possible to belong to two economic organizations at once?

[Answer] There is no antagon-sm between them. The fact that we belong to the
CEPGL does not prevent us belonging to other organizations.

[Question] Is it not in Burundi's interests to orient itself toward East Africa,
which is its real pole of attraction?

[Answer] It is true that, leaving the country's colonial past to one side.
culturally. ethnically. linguistically and economically, Burundi is part of

East Africa. Initially incorporated into German East Africa, the country was
placed under a Belgian mandate until 1924 and then under Belgian trusteeship
until just after World War II. We have certainly been in close contact with
Zaire but we have not had any economic relations with that country (particularly
in the sphere of transport). Our msntalities are different and in that respect
we are close to East Africa. Nevertheless. it is in Burundi's interest to belong
to the two groups as a link country between East Africa and West Africa."

[Question] There is talk of tension between Burundi and Zaire."

[Answer] It is not a question of tension. Rumors about Zairian claims to
Burundian territory have been circulating. As far as I know, there is no border
problem between the two countries. This border was established 70 years ago in
Berlin and Brussels. It is known to all. and, until now, has never been questioned.
I do not see how Zaire could do it, after 20 years of independence.

[Question] Why is Burundi arming itself at the moment?

[Answer] Burundi is not arming any more than it was. The ratio of military to
civilians is one of the lowest in the region and in the world. Our defense budget
is modest. He have no territorial ambitions. We have a gendarmerie and land army
because we are independent and because we must be in a position to maintain
internal order and deter aggressors. The world has already seen governments
which have been overthrown by mercenaries which have themselves called on
mercenaries to maintain internal order.

[Question] It is also said that you have received Libyan arms and that you enjoy
privileged relations with Tripoli.

[Answer] We asked for and received arms from Libya. The agreements were
concluded on an official basis. That is common knowledge. We have also bought
arms from the Soviet Union. France, Belgium. and other countries. As for our
privileged relations with Tripoli, that is just propaganda fueled by Libya's
enemies. We are not, however, against Libya. That country has its revolution
and we have ours.

BTHIOPIANS REPORTEDLY LAUNCH ERITREAN OPYENSIVE
JN201810 London REUTER in English 1667 CHI 20 Feb 82
[By Mohamed Sidahmed]

[Text] Khartoum, 20 Feb (REUTER)-Ethiopian planes are making daily bombing runs
against guerrilla positions in the rugged Eritrean highlands as part of s major of-
fensive against Eritrean secessionista, a guerrilla spokesman said today.

The spokesman for the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front (EPLP) said the guerrillas
had killed 400 Ethipian troops and wounded 550 others in two battles on Thursday
and Friday.

According to the EPFL. the Ethiopian Government launched a full-scale offensive
against the guerrillas. who are fighting for the independence of the strategic Red
Sea Province, last Tuesday.

The Soviet-backed Addis Ababa government has deployed some 120,000 troops in a drive
to crush the rebels who have been battling for independence for the past 20 years,
according to the guerrilla accounts.

The spokesman said the Ethiopians were attempting to encircle the guerrillas in
the highlands about 120 miles (160 kms) north of the provincial capital of Asmara.

The spokesman said that in the two battles the Eritrean forces had inflicted heavy
losses on the Ethiopians, forcing then to retreat and leaving their dead and wounded
behind.

An Ethiopian MiG-23 was hit by rebel anti-aircraft fire and forced to crash-land at
ASmara airport this week. he added. He gave no details of EPLP losses.

Announcing the start of the offensive earlier this week. the spokesman said the
EPLP was prepared for the Ethiopian attack and was armed with tanks and anti-
aircraft guns. artillery. medium and light weapons.

The Ethiopian Government has vowed to fight for the "final destruction" of the Brit-
rean secessionists, who came close to seizing complete control of the province four
years ago before being driven back by the Ethiopian Army. The EPLP, one of two
main Eritrean guerrilla groups, is headquartered in the mountain stronghold of

Nakfa in the highlands north of Asmara.

ETHIOPIA USES CHRHCAL WEAPONS IN ERITREA ATTACK
M71625 London THE GUARDIAN in English 17 Feb 82 p 8

[Report by Victoria Brittain: "Ethiopia Makes New Attack in Eritrea With 90,000
Troops"]

[Text] The Ethiopian military regime has launched an offensive in Eritrea, expected
since 90,000 troops were moved into the area last month. In an attack at Tirukruk
on Monday, chemical weapons were used for the first time and refugees fled over the
border into Sudan, according to the Eritrean People's Liberation Front.

The Ethiopian ambassador in Iondon denied that gas was being used. Hr Wolde
Giorgia Ayalew said that the area was merely being cleared of saboteura.

The attack at Tirukruk in north-eastern Eritrea, near the Sudanese border, is
presumed to be an attempt to cut off supplies from the Eritrean guerrillas in their
base camps and the ruined town of Nacfa which they still hold. The region is moun-
tainous and the attack which began on Monday used no tanks, but only infantry who
retreated after some hours of fighting, but then returned with the gas, according to
the EPLF.

The Eritreans have been fighting for 20 years to preserve the independence from
Ethiopia which they had first as an Italian colony, than as a League of Nations and
United Nations trusteeship. In 1977, the Eritreans seized control of almost the
whole area except the provincial capital, Asmara. But $2 billion worth of Russian
arms and 2,000 Soviet military advisers have helped to transform the Ethiopian Army
and have brought the towns of Eritrea (except Nacfa) back under the control of
Addis Ababa.

Soviet advisers are playing a key role in the organisation of the latest offensive,
which has moved more troops than before into Eritrea and the bordering Tigre Pro-
vince which has been in revolt for six years.

Before Monday's attack there had been sporadic fighting over the weekend in the
southern highlands of Eritrea in which the guerrillas clain to have dislodged go-
vernaent troops 'from highland encampments. Two convoys of government troops mov-
ing out of the main forward base at Koren were ambushed over the weekend too. The
EPLP claim that more than 3,000 Ethiopian troops were killed and wounded and arms
were captured including anti-aircraft and machine-guns.

Previous offensives have dragged on for weeks with no official information being
given by the government. A clear picture of the military and political battles
underway now in Eritrea may take months to emerge.

In the countryside the Marxist EPLP which is the dominent Eritrean grOup, has
used the years since 1976 to implant a strong ideological base. Last month. the
Ethiopian head of state, Colonel Mengistu, announced a political, social and eco-
nomic programme, Operation Red Star. to bring Eritreans into line with the rural
programme of Marxist Ethiopia.

DISTURBANCES SEEN PART OF GENERALIZED AFRICAN PHBNOMENON
Paris JEUNE APRIQUE in French No 1094, 23 Dec 81 p 25
[Article by JEUNE APRIQUE special correspondent Sophie Bessis]

[Text] It all started at the University of Libreville, that well-heeled capi-
tal where money gushes up from the ground, where student scholarships are
higher than the salaries of the "minimum wage“ workers, but where, now that the
battle for survival is won, people are no longer content to live by bread
alone. In late November tracts began to appear denouncing the policy of the
head of state and demanding a return to a multiparty system and democracy. In
fact, President Bongo in September had promulgated a new constitution officially
establishing a one-party system. Has this the spark that touched off the
powder keg? However that may be, on 1 December the capital's bus station was
invaded by several hundred demonstrators, youths for the most part, brandishing
placards hostile to the regime: "Down with Bongo, 15 years is enough...."

The demonstration, which eyewitnesses say was quickly and heavyhandedly dis-
persed, gave rise to a vigorous reaction on the part of the authorities. Arrests
were made on the scene, and several individuals elsewhere were apprehended.

The residences of several French development experts were searched, and Jean-
Pierre Cot, the French minister of cooperation, reportedly protested this to
President Bongo during his visit to Libreville 5—9 December. While the author-
ities admitted that 10 people had been incarcerated, including Jules Hba. former
ambassador to Cairo. the most alarming rumors were circulating in Libreville to
the effect that some 50 had been detained.

The arrest of the rector of the university, Hr Jean-Pierre Nroghe-Nguema, who
was recalled from a mission he was carrying out in Brazzaville, raised the ten-
sion another notch. Since he was first arrested and interrogated at the offices
of the security forces, some 2,000 students and some of the university professors
have been on strike to demand his "immediate" release, which has not yet taken
place. “is replacement by Mr Laurent Biffot, former head of the school at which
party professionals in the state's only party were trained, did nothing to calm
things down. Arousing violent opposition, Biffot was even held in the rectorate
against his will by a hundred angry students on 10 December.

The government has been taking the incidents very seriously since they began.
Though the police forces assigned to keep the university under surveillance
have been more discreet since the forces of law and order in combat dress eva-
cuated the campus on 11 December, the authorities are conducting a comprehensive

38

investigation to determine the source of the movement and its real impact on
the population. Heavyhanded interrogations are still under way, and reports
about mistreatment of the detainees have not been denied.

'Why do you think the Gabonese should be better than anyone else?" officials
retort when asked what truth there is to the reports. In a letter to the head
of state, Mr Nzoghe—Nguema nevertheless denied accusations that he belongs to
the opposition. But of what opposition is he speaking? Is there any evidence
to substantiate the theory of conspiracy the authorities apparently hope to
find? For some time there has been a great deal of talk about a clandestine
organization called HOREHA (National Recovery Movement) which supposedly ignited
the flames of protest.

Even if there is an organized opposition faction, is not what Gabon is going
through still just more or less the same kind of "backlash" most other African
countries have suffered? There is the frustration of the populace as. power-
less to change anything, it watches the excessively rapid rise of an ostenta-
tiously wealthy middle class; there is the discontent felt by an increasingly
better educated body of youth which does not accept the rules of a political
game in which it cannot make its voice heard; there is the sobering prospect of
reaching a peak level of oil production and eventually even seeing that level
decline, while spending for prestige begins to increase again as Libreville
prepares to host the next UNCTAD [United Nations Conference on Trade and Devel-
opment] conference in 1986.

If there is nothing new about the causes, one may fear that the regime's reac-
tions may also be predictable. Will the machinery of repression be engaged in
Gabon? Before we know. we will have to see what charges are brought against
the detainees.

ADDITIGIAL ccc: AID, LOANS mom's!)
Paris meats mncaux a‘r mlramnsms in French No 1885, 1 Jan 82 p ho

[Text] Following the signing on 11 December 1981 of two loan conventions with the
Central Fund for Economic Cooperation [CCCB] (2.5 billion Malagnsy francs; see
MARCHES TROPICAUX ET MEDITERRAMEENS of 25 December 1981, p 3444), four other Franco-
Malagasy loan agreements were signed on 21 December. The signatories were

Mr Rakotovao-Razakaboana, the Malagasy minister of finance and planning, and Mr Paul
B1anc. the French ambassador to Antananarivo. The four agreements cover 400 million
Malagasy francs (Fr 8 million) of nonreimbursable aid from the Aid and Cooperation
Fund (PAC) and a loan of 750 million Malagasy francs (Fr 15 million) from the CCCE.

The first three agreements (grant agreements) concern: (1) the second installment
(300 million Malagasy francs) of a grant to finance construction of a microwave link
connecting Fianarantsoa (in Hauts-Plateaux) with Tbliara (southwest coast) through
Fort-Dauphin (southeast coast); (2) agroindustrial studies for the production of
brewery-quality barley (first installment, 50 million Malagasy francs); (3) 50 million
Malagasy francs in emergency assistance for the anti-grasshopper campaign in the
faritanies of Finarantsoa and Toliara.

The fourth agreement (the CCCE loan of 750 million Malagasy francs) involves the
second and final installment of the CCCE's contribution to construction of the
microwave link between Fianarsntsoa, Fort-Dauphin and Toliara. The loan is to be
paid back in 15 years, after a grace period of 7 years, and carries a 6 percent in-
terest rate. This loan brings CCCE's total contributions to Malagasy projects in
1981 up to 11.75 billion Phlagasy francs, compared to 6 billion in 1980.

Paris APRIQUB-ASIE in French No 255. 21 Dec 91-3 Jan 82 pp 16-18
[Article by Fode Amadou: mm... the Plunderer"!

[Text]- "I came to Washington to seek assistance in the economic
and security spheres. And I can say that whereever I went—-State
Department, Department of Defense. the Treasury or the Congress--
I was given full and total satisfaction." President Desire Hobutu
of Zaire boasted this past 2 December during a news conference
which he gave at the end of his 3-day working visit to
Hashington. Satisfied? Anybody would be even with less. Did he
not have the privilege of meeting not only Ronald Reagan but also
Vice President George Bush. Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
Secretary of Defense Caspar Heinberger and several other Hhite
House and State Department highranking officials? All of whom
assured him that,'whatever the cost, Zaire-vs country which has
been a friend of the United States for over 20 years-dmust be
strengthened in the economic and security spheres. And Nguza
Karl-I-Bond, A LA TRAPPB.

Fully satisfied? Certainly. Mobutu went home with his beggar's
bag full: $33.5 million worth of economic aid (10 million

more than in the previous year), $12 million worth of military
.aid (twice the amount received in 1981), not to mention a small
bonus of "between $10 and $12 million" which he was given as 0.8.
aid to dispatch a military contingent to Grad. And not wanting
to miss anything, at the end of his visit he also went to New
York for "talks" with American businessmen. For a few more
dollars?...Dollars which will not benefit the Zairian people
and, as usual. will go to increase the fortune of this beggar
from Kinshasa who is rolling in riches. Today, we will finish
presenting a provisional--and probably incomplete--inventory

of thatlfortune which we started discussing in our issue

No 252.

According to a parliamentary investigation, which has never been challenged, between
1976 and 1978, Hobutu and his clan are reported to have embezzled some 60 billion
old French francs which they have safely tucked away in Swiss banks in a nanner which
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

would be described in Paris as the move of a cheating banker ready to skip the country.2
But even if these sums of money seem very large, particularly to the poverty-stricken
people of Zaire and other countries. they are only the very small tip of Mobutu's
enormous fortune. How much does it add up to?

Paul-Roger Hokende. one of the leaders of the Lumumba-Congolese National Movement,
answered that question a few days ago during a news conference in Rome and his
statements confirm information from other Belgian and 0.8. sources. He gave the
staggering figure of SS billion. This is exactly the amount of Zaire's external
debt. “hat a puzzling coincidence!

Joseph-Desire, known as Sese Seko, who started with nothing in 1969 except for a
gargantuan appetite, has accumulated that huge nest egg in 16 years of dictatorial
rule. But how?

Officially, the president-founder of one of the largest fortunes in the world gets

an annual emolument in zaires, the country's currency. This year his salary was 148
million zaires (approximately 30 billion old French francs). By comparison, the
annual budget of the very rich province of Shaba is only 53 million zaires. just
over 1/4 of the pocket-money received by the general-president. He has no difficulty
in converting his "declared" earnings into Belgian francs. for instance. Hen 0n whom
he can rely and whom he has put in charge of Zairian banks and companies. take care
of it. They include people such as his brother-in-law Fangpi and Dambana Gpepa, both
tops officials of the National Savings Bank who will not deny him anything. They set
so openly that not too long ago they opened a branch of their bank in the National
Assembly building. There, they buy nonconvertible local currency from deputies.
ministers and their proteges giving an exchange rate of 2.5 Belgian francs and then
resell it, by very special authorization, at the official rate of 10 Belgian francs.

Big Bribes

Therefore, despite the low value of the currency created by the miltimillionaire
Mobutu, it is still possible to make large profits from that currency providing that
one has. as he does, very large sums. Let us add, in connection with these dealings,
that to make things easier for his henchmen, the supreme leader of Kinshasa has
intervened with officials uf the Brussels Stock Exchange so that the floating exchange
rate of the zaire is never published.

But this fraudelent activity which has been going on since its major beneficiary
became head of state is one of the chief methods used to misappropriate funds.
produces only a fraction of Sese Seko's holdings. His sources of money acquisition
are as inexhaustive as the wealth of the country. They include sectors as varied as
largescale smuggling of diamonds, gold and strategic mineral ores; then, there is
the appropriation of argicultural plantations, of real estate and transportation
enterprises and, finally, the well-known practice of big bribes.

Diamonds are considered to be the ideal preciOus stone because their high value remains
constant and they are not bulky. They are very much coveted as well as subject to

a very strict vigilance. The outcasts working in the diamond mines live under
conditions similar to those of a prison. But European engineers and 0.5. investigators,
who are not completely antagonistic to Hobutu'a dictatorship, have discovered and

disclusvd that every year. a large number of already inventoried diamonds are illegally
taken out of the safes of the mining company MIRA [Bakwanga Mining Company] and taken
to the London market. The proceeds of their sale is immediately transferred to
Mobutu's bank accounts in Switzerland. The operation starts at the MIBA and is
carried with the Tshikapa Marketing Office and the MELTA [expansion unknown] acting

as middlemen. Among the major shareholders of these three companies are Mobutu and.
just by coincidence, his son Niwa keeping good company to the notorious General
Belgian Company and the more low profiled Tempelsman Company of South Africa.

Gold leaves Zaire under similar circumstances but, curiously enough, in amounts which
go practically unchecked. Nobody, but Hobutu, knows the real output of the Zairian
mining companies. It is, perhaps, because that as for gold, a precious metal but

more plentiful than diamonds, they neglect to be vigilant? Not likely given the greed
of the gold mining companies. Simeki and Kilo ﬂats are two of these companies.

The first is under the tight supervision of Mobutu's uncle, Litho, and his nephew
Moleka is in charge of marketing operations in the second company. It has become
general knowledge in Kinshasa, Brussels, London and particularly in Zurich that much
of the gold mined by those companies ends up in the safes which the brilliant leader
has in Switzerland.

Also in Switzerland where, among other things, Father Joseph-Desire, the terrible
Father Ubu of Africa, owns a 32-room castle near Lausanne which requires a permanent
staff of 26 servants and maintenance workers costing its owner in the neighborhood of
400 million old French francs a year. But not in Spain, where he owns a 16th century
castle in Valencia, nor in Torremolinos or in Nice, France, where he also owns property.
No, Switzerland is the only country where the banks do not ask anything but to look
after the treasures of the top figures of the international underworld.

The Zairian dictator does not sniff at strategic mineral ores. From their sales, he
gets very considerable earnings which are added to his other holdings. This was
ascertained when illegal sales--but he is the law--had to be made to South Africa
which involved tens of thousands of tons of, among others. cobalt and copper-~for a
total value of 6 billion old French francs-to cover some expenses such as the large
bills to pay for the building of a burial monument for his now deceased first wife
Marie-Antoinette. And who can forget the statements, which were never denied, made
by former ministers now living in exile denouncing their former boss for constantly
dipping into the funds and foreign accounts of GECAMINES [General Quarries and Mines
Company] which has always been under the management of the Zairian nabob's straw men.

Outside the Kokolo military camp in Kinshasa, the building site of a large public
works project has stood for 21 years. In 1960, shortly before independence. the
Belgian colonial authorities started building a 1.000-bed hospital. It is still not
finished. And that. despite the existence of a Zairian company which has a monopoly
over the construction of public buildings. schools, hospitals and so On. That company
is the National Real Estate Credit Company, the CNCI, whose real boss is Mobutu
represented by his uncle Litho. his son Niwa and his nephew Moleka. This big company
prefers to build shopping arcades. big department stores such as the Galerie
Presidentielle (owned by Mobutu), near the Belgian Embassy in Kinshasa, which holds
cxlusive rights to sell all the big international brand names, or such as the Centre
Regina or African-Lux directly controlled by his nephew Moleka on behalf of the
family.

Travelers’ Pockets

But, true to type, Joseph-Desire does not forget his peasant origins. He loves the
land. the fields, the farms. the crops harvested and grown there by over—exploited
workers. And to show his interest in the sacred and fruitful foil of Zaire, he and
the now deceased Marie-Antoinette created the Zairian Farming and Livestock Company
merging the properties of lb colonial and neocolonial estates. He was killing two
birds with one stone: he became a major exporter of Zairian farm and livestock
products and engaged in "decolonization." But the Belgian supervisory staff and
continued to practice the good old colonial methods of production driving some young
workers to leave for the towns where they joined the ranks of the unemployed while
others perfered to seek work in the intolerable mines.

By now it is obvious that no money-making operation escapes the ogre of Kinshasa.
So, anybody who wants to engage in some business, make some transaction or simply
transfer funds to his friends or allies, cannot hope to do so without him as a
middleman. For instance, in 1976, the CIA sent him $2 million on condition that
$1,386,700 would be handed over to the UNITA [National Union for Total Independence
of Angola] headed by Savimbi and to the FNLA [Angolan National Liberation Front] of
his dear and unfortunate friend Holden Roberto. He was unfortunate to the extreme
that his protector pocketed all the money as reported by John Stockwell, a former
CIA agent, in his book "In Search of Enemies."

Big contracts are referred to him personally and only naive people express surprise to
find how much money is squandered in large and unnecessary projects such as the two
deals made with the French Thomson-CS? Company involving a satellite communication
link which was only used twice and the "Voice of Zaire" radio and television complex
now completely run down. These "deals" have cost the Nobutu regime 32 billion old
French francs but not everybody lost money.

"There is only one solution to stop this fraud, corruption and the ruination of Zaire
and it is to marginalize Hobutu and his clan," said Irwin Blumenthal who was assigned,
in 1978, by the Hbrld Bank and the IMF to supervise the famous "Hobutu Plan."

Even with all his resources and authority, Irwin Blumenthal had to give up. He was
only able to control one-fourth of the proceeds of the state's exports while the
remaining three-quarters were under the exclusive control of Mobutu and his clan.

The state-owned sector is totally at Mobutu's beck and call since he controls it

through managers who owe their jobs and their freedom to him. Host of these managers
are notorious defrauders. There is. for instance, citizen Hpaae, dismissed as
university rector on charges of fraud, who is a member of the government and of the
Political Bureau and who, in 1980, was appointed as personal adviser to the president

in charge of presidential grants...or there is Munga, head of the transport company
CTCZ [expansion unknown] who was jailed for fraud, then released and put in charge of
the Zairian national railroad company, the SNCZ. by Sese Seko. Or else, there is
Sambwa, governor of the Central Bank, who had been dismissed because of misappropriation
of funds but was given that post by the boss.

The current year's estimated deficit of Zaire's balance of payments amounts to 75
billion old French francs. Officially, the president gets 30 billion not to mention
his earnings from the private and state sectors. Day after day, while the Zairian
Father Ubu continues to bleed and exhaust the riches of the great Zaire. a Zairian

worker's salary is 23 zaires a month. According to the official labor union UNTZa
[ﬂational Union of Workers of Zaire] that worker would need 1.061 zaires to survive.
That same worker requires a week's salary to buy a kilo of fish and he must work 2

weeks to pay for a bag of cassava. Meanwhile. the salary of a political commissioner
is 017 times that of his servant.

Therefore, all those who belong to the masters' class are riding on the backs of the
millions who belong to the famished masses. The latter include the 80,000 soldiers
who are not frum the same province as their president and commander-in-chief and

even the custom officers posted at the Kinshasa landing point who rifle the pockets
of travelers from Brazzaville.

In 1960, a worker had to work 1 hour and 46 minutes to pay for 1 kilo of fish. now
beyond his reach. On that same year, the Congo-Kinshasa, as the country was then
known, had 165,000 kilometers of roads suitable for motor vehicles. Today it only

has 58,000 kilometers of such roads and only 26,000 kilometers are kept up in good
condition.

Twenty-one years after independence. 20 years after Lumumba's assassination, Hobutu

has accumulated a fortune equivalent to Ziare's debt. Nobody can ignore this any
longer.

BUDGET FOR 1982 SHOWS 1 BILLION ZAIRE DEFICIT
Paris HARCHES TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANEENS in French No 1886, 1 Jan 82, p 36
[Text] 1982 Budget Deficit of 1 Billion Zaires

The Republic of Zaire's draft budget for 1982 was adopted by the legislature on

21 December 1981. According to the draft, budget forecasts for 1982 are 7,834.2
million [sic; probably billion] zaires in income and 8,834.2 million [sic] zaires

in expenses. The budget deficit therefore amounts to 1 billion zaires [sic].
Compared to financial year 1981, the ways and means budget for 1982 shows an increase
of 2,217.8 million zaires, while expenditures show an increase of 2,717.1 million.

There is an overall increase in income of 61.82 percent over 1981. Income from
tax assessments is 66 percent higher than in 1981. The higher rate of increase is
due to indirect taxes which are forecast at 698.5 million for 1982 as compared to
260 million in 1980, an increase of 169 percent.

Then there are real taxes which increase by 105 percent, with forecasts going from
13.7 million in 1981 to 28.1 million in 1982. Income taxes, the largest amount,
increase 63 percent, from 1,532.3 zaires in 1981 to 2,197.8 million in 1982.

Forecasts for customs duty income for 1982 are down 13 percent as compared to 1981.
This decline is basically due to the share of income represented by export duties.
Estimated excise taxes actually increased 122 percent, and import duties, 119 percent.

In presenting the draft budget to the legislature on 1 December, Hr Sings Udjuu,
first state commissioner, described the overall context within which the budget

was prepared. The world economic situation is still of concern, the recession
persists and the oil bill is increasing. In a world environment which is not very
reassuring, he indicated, "our concern in preparing the 1982 budget has been to seek
policies and actions to undertake on the national level to reduce the harmful effects
of the world crisis on our country."

However, he recognized that the difficult economic period which the country is going
through cannot be explained by the poor international economic situation alone. There
are also internal causes which President Hobutu has branded as a disgrace on many

occasions, particularly the lack of control and scrupulousness in the handling of
the country‘s affairs and the lack of a coherent and realistic plan of action. It
was to remedy this situation that the head of state conceived and established the

ha

Hobutu Plan which aims to recreate conditions for recovery of the Zairian economy.
Mr Sings also stated that the budget forecasts for the 1982 financial year had been
prepared with a view towards pursuing and reinforcing efforts already undertaken

to attain s lasting economic recovery which should result in noticeably improved
living conditions for the Zairian people in the near future.

The first state commissioner then presented the executive council's program of
activities for the public health, agriculture and energy sectors.

In the agriculture sector, appropriations for 1982 increase to 300 million zaires
from 166 million in 1981. Added to this are 60 million zaires to deal with the poor
condition of the road network for distribution of farmers' agricultural produce.
(See below).

In the energy sector, new projects for 1982 include renovation of four hydroelectric
power plants in the Shaba region, development of the site where the Katende dam

will be built in the Kaeai-Occidential region, extension of the Kinshasa water supply
network and piping of water in about 40 cities and areas of the country.

To closely supervise the budget's enforcement, the executive council has decided to
establish a permanent budget commission as of January 1982 not only to see that all
the funds planned for the achievement of program activities are actually released.

but also that all the income expected is actually received. Furthermore, all non-

profit organizations providing public services of insufficiently justified value

or those which could finance themselves through their own activities will cease to

be included in the State Budget as of 1982, the first state comiesioner indicated.

COUNCIL STUDIES AGRICULTURAL CAMPAIGN. WAYS TO IMPROVE FOOD SUPPLY
Paris HARCHES TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANBENS in French No 1886, 1 Jan 82 p 36

[Text] Hays and Means to Intensify the Agricultural Campaign

During its meeting of 20 and 28 November 1981, the executive council proceeded with
an in—depth examination of the efforts made and to be made to intensify the agricul-
tural campaign and to improve the country's food supply.

The council closely studied the problem of maintaining the roads essential to rapid
and assured transportation of produce. Out of the 145,000 km of roads which
constitute Zaire's network, 65,000 will be taken over by the office of roads.
Maintenance of the remaining 100,000 km will be entrusted to regional highway crews
on the one hand, and to companies with interests in the region and who will conclude
agreements with the State, on the other. An interdepartmental commission has been
established to draw up the criteria which will determine selection of the companies.
The necessary funds will be "regionalized."

In regard to fuel, the Department of Energy has been given the responsibility of
finding solutions for improving supply to the fertile areas in the east.

The question of placing state agricultural enterprises under private ownership has
been left unsettled while awaiting determination of criteria and practical methods
for this operation.

The idea of c~eating an agricultural credit bank has definitely been decided upon.
The headquarters of this organization will be located in Kinshasa and branches will
be opened in all areas of the country. Technical schools for agriculture will be
given new impetus. All graduates of these institutions will be registered to serve
as supervisory staff for the farms.

The governors of the regions will begin a census of peasants and farmers and will
determine as closely as possible the areas under cultivation as well as the amounts

to be harvested. In this regard, the agricultural statistic service of the Department
of Agriculture estimates that the number of farm households in Zaire has increased
from 2,620,000 in 1970 to 2,950,000 in 1980, which corresponds to 15,300,000 people.
