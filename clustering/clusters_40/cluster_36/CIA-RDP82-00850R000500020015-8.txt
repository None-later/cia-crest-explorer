[Articlez 'ﬁhe éconoaic and Monetary Situation of the Central African States at the
End of June 1981"]

[Text] The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) recently published its periodic
analysis of the national econonies under its purview as of the end of the first half
of 1981.

While the drop in cacao production continues in Gabon and Cameroon, it is improving
in the Congo after a rather long period of decline. The sane is true for coffee in
Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and the Congo, while Gabon is experiencing

some weakening. As for cotton, the harvest is down in the Central African Republic
[CAR], but it is satisfactory in Cameroon and Chad. Lumbering reaains unsatisfac-

tory. The decline in mining production is continuing in Gabon; the Congo is bene-

fiting fron greater stability.

Generally speaking, commercial and industrial activity has grown, except in the CAR,
where there has been a slight downturn.

Ihin Export Products Market Activity

Cacao: In Caneroon, the harvest reached 114,891 metric tons (down 4.4 percent from
the previous harvest) as of 31 July 1981. The productive zone in the Center—South
region was invaded by defoliating caterpillars, and the 120,000-123,000 metric tons
forecast will probably not be had. In Gabon, production is down 18.5 percent for
the first 8 months of the season and reaches only 2,693 metric tons. After the pre-
scribed production inproveuents, production showed a 29.3 percent increase of 2,444
metric tons as of the end of June.

Coffee: In Cameroon, the Robusta harvest had exceeded the forecast 75,000 metric
tons with 81,450 aetric tons (up 31.9 percent over the previous season). The Arabica
harvest is also under way. Froa July 1980 to July 1981, the total production of
coffee in Cameroon has risen 29.9 percent with 101,705 metric tons. In the Congo,
the harvest as of the end of June totaled 2,211 aetric tons (up 19.6 percent). In
Gabon, the results at the end of May, after 11 months of the season, are down 11.9
percent with 423 metric tons. In the CAR, production continues to increase; exports
totaled 8,653 metric tons (up 16.2 percent) as of 30 June 1981.

Cotton: ln Cameroon, the seed cotton harvest at the end of May cane to 83,344 metric

tons (up 5 percent). As of 31 May in the CAR, 22,590 metric tons of seed cotton had

supplied the mills with 8,297 metric tons of cotton fiber; the harvest is lower than
- 1
the preceding one. In Chad, with 85,716 metric tons of seed cotton as of 30 June
1981, the improvement comes to 4.4 percent. '

Bananas: In Cameroon, the production marketed by the end of May came to 20,490 metric
tons (down 12.86 percent); season forecasts were for 63,700 metric tons.

Palm oil and palmettoes: In Cameroon, the Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC)
and Pamol showed a rather sharp drop in their production, which came to a total of

19,582 metric tons of palm oil and 1,988 metric tons of palmettoes (CDC) by the
end of May.

Rubber: In Cameroon, CDC production came to 4,770 metric tons by the end of May 1981
(up 949 metric tons). For Panel, the drop at the end of April was down 5.4 percent.

Tea and pepper: In Cameroon, tea production came to 556 metric tons (down 13.7 per-

cent) by the end of May 1981. Pepper counted for 125 metric tons. a large increase
of 74 metric tons.

Lumbering: In Gabon, okoume production, with 363,694 cubic meters at the end of May
1981 showed a drop of 24.8 percent; the slump affects exports while local sales are

increasing noticeably. Ozigo production by the end of May came to 18,109 cubic meters
(down 14 percent).

In the Congo, okoume production continues to decline. At the end of April, purchases
totaled 10,926 cubic meters (down 30.9 percent). Exports were down 29.3 percent
while local sales increased. Other items are also down: productioa is down 18.5
percent and exports down 32.6 percent at the end of April 1981.

In Cameroon at the end of May, rough timber exports totaled 142,453 metric tons
(down 26.9 percent); this drop is partly attributable to the difficulties in trans-

porting timber from the cutting sites to the Douala stockyard. Sawing shipments of
57,804 metric tons were up 14.3 percent.

In the CAR, the first 4 months of 1981 confirmed the difficulties in lumbering,

as production came to only 50 percent of that in the first 4 months of 1980. or
16,970 cubic meters of rough timber.

Oil and Mining Activity

Petroleum and natural gas: In Gabon, with 3 million metric tons [mt] at the end of

May 1981, the decline came to 21.2 percent. 0n the other hand, the production of
natural gas increased 11 percent.

In the Congo, the production of crude came to 2 million mt (up 34.3 percent) as of
30 June 1981. Natural gas production is still suspended because of plant remodeling.

1n Cameroon, the first months' statistics for 1981 are not out yet; exports of crude
in 1980 totaled 1.3 million mt, down 16.5 percent from 1979.

Mining production: In Gabon, the situation of the world steel industry caused

a large drop in manganese production with 632,000 mt by 30 June 1981 (down 483,000 mt)
and $53,000 mt in exports (down $10,000 mt). It is unlikely that 1981 production
forecasts of 1.5 million mt will be met. Also in Gabon, a slight increase was noted
in uranium production; by the end of May, the production of uranium metal concentrates
came to 439 mt (up 1.4 percent); exports were also up 3 percent.

In the CAR, diamond production in the first half of 1981 was down 17.3 percent with
154,900 carats; exports were 149,500 carats (down 18.4 percent). The production of
cut stones slowed from the first half of 1980. CAR gold production in the first
half of 1981 came to only 43 kilograms (as opposed to 245 kg) at a value of 79.9
million francs CFA [African Financial Community] (down 355 million francs CFA).

In Cameroon, 1981 statistics for aluminum production were unavailable; by 30 November
1980, production had fallen by 50 percent, and exports were down 63.4 peieent.

In the Congo, lead production was 2,424 mt as of 30 April 1981, for an increase of
42.7 percent.

Industrial and Commercial Activity

In Gabon, the first third of 1981 had a slight increase, up 5.5 percent, over the
preceding 4-month period. While the food industry (flour and sugar) and the textile
industry (printing and garment manufacturing) markedly improved their business volume
(from 13.2 to 45.1 percent), lumber, brewing and tobacco showed a decline (from 4.9
to 60.1 percent).

In Camerooon, the total business volume of the member enterprises of the Cameroon
Industrial Union (Syndustricamﬁ came to 210.3 billion francs CFA for 1980 (up 19.4
percent); considering an inflation rate of 15 percent, the real increase came to

4.4 percent. Export volume was stationary (up 1 percent). Chemicals and metallurgy
incxeased about 20 percent. .Salaries grew 31 percent, and industrial employment
increased 18 percent.

In the Congo, industrial activity improved noticeably, up 23.5 percent between May

1980 and April 1981. The chemical industry was up 57.7 percent in production and
65.5 percent in business volume. Manufacturing increased business volume 13.5 percent,
and the food industry was up 33.4 percent. 0n the other hand, Hydrocongo was down

8.1 percent in volume over the same period.

In the CAR, industry improved its business volume 14 percent in the period from April
1980 to March 1981, while commercial firms had a drop of 11.8 percent in tales.

Prices, Foreign Trade, Finance

Price index: In Cameroon, the price index for African style consumption was up 8 per-
cent hetween June 1980 and the end of May 1981. In the CAR, the wholesale price index
rose 15.8 percent from July 1980 to the end of June 1981. In the Congo, the retail
price index rose 6.5 percent in 1980. In Gabon, from May 1980 to the end of April
1981, the retail price increase for African type products was limited to 4.7 percent.

Foreign trade: Only the figures for January 1981 are available for Cameroon;
foriegn trade in that month shows a deficit of 14.6 billion francs CPA, as opposed
to a surplus of 16.8 billiOn francs CFA in January 1980.

Monetary situation: The monetary situation in the issuance zone of the Central African
States Bank (Chad excluded because of the current situation) as of 31 May 1981 featured
a new increase in the money supply, a marked expansion of credit in the economy,

a consolidation of public treasuries' credit positions with respect to the banking
system, and strengthening of official foreign holdings.

All the states except Chad were net creditors on their foreign holdings as of 31 March
1980. Gabon had the exchange value of 34.3 billion francs CPA, followed by the Congo,
the CAR, and Cameroon. The improved position of the Congo and Gabon can be attributed
to receipts from their oil exports. The improvement in the CAR's position is attri-
butable to the continued low level of domestic demand and to investment demand. The
slump in Cameroon is due to increasing bank indebtedness to foreign lenders.

Credits to the economy, 717.5 billion francs CPA, increased by 28.4 percent in a
year (as opposed to 19.7 percent for the preceding period). As of 31 May 1981,

short. middle and long-term credit per country in Billions of francs CPA were as
follows: Cameroon, 470.6; Gabon, 149.8; Congo, 76.4; the CAR, 20.7; total 717.5.

The expansion of credit in Cameroon is due mainly to financing linked to oil pro-
duction and to the financing needs of the cooperatives and mutual service organiza-
tions in agriculture. In Gabon, the main users of credit are in oil production,
manganese mining and lumbering. 1n the Congo, credit demand comes from the oil
industry, food industry, and transportation. As for the CAR, cotton marketing
traditionally needs credit when the season begins.

Between May 1980 and May 1981, the general position of the national treasuries
with regard to the banking system has been remarkably consolidated, the credit
balance rising from 13.1 to 73.9 billion francs CPA. Cameroon has a large positive
balance (85.9 billion francs CPA), as does Gabon to a lesser extent (9.9 billion),
while the treasuries of the CAR and Congo have a debit balance of 16.8 and 10 bil-
lion frnncs CPA, respectively. Gabon and the Congo have repaid the issuing insti-
tute the credit advanced to them. The CAR, on the other hand, increased its loan
from the Central Bank by using the International Monetary Fund.

Bill and coins in circulation came to 173.7 billion francs CPA as of 31 May 1981.
The amount increased 26.8 percent in 12 months, more than the rate in the previous
period (15.8 percent). By country, paper money in circulation at the end of May
198! was: Cameroon, 84.3 billion francs CPA (up 27.3 percent); the CAR, 30.5 bil-
lion (np 40.1 percent); the Congo, 25.6 billion (up 35.3 percent); Gabon, 33.3
billion (up 10.7 percent).

ANGOLA

(SEC) received an order of 16 30 1: fishing boats that will be delivered to Angola
within the Italian progress of aid to Africa. Hardly anyone needs to be ruinded
that, 20 years ago, Angola disposed of one of the largest fishing industries of
the African continent. In 1960, fishing yields anointed to over 250,000 tons.
Ten years later they reached 500,000 tons and in 1972 they crested at 600,000
tons. A collapse of production occurred in 1975, due in part to the civil war
and the conflict aith South Africa but also the destruction of canneriea and the
loss of boats used by refugees to leave the country. These last years, fishing
yielded fron 2,500 to 3,000 tons of fish per month, that is an annual production
of between 30,000 and 36,000 tons, more than half of which was consued fresh and
25 percent as frozen fish, the rest being either dried (15 percent) or canned

(5 percent). The Luanda authorities are trying to revitalize the fishing sector.
hence, particularly, the contract signed at Viareggio between Mr lienrique Prino,
director of Angolan fisheries, and Mr Renzo 90:20, the sdniniatrator delegated by
SEC, for the supply by the Italian cowany of 16 boats equipped for shrinp fish-
ing as well as for trawling. [Text] [Paris HARBHES TROPICAUX 31! MIDI

Paris MARCHBS TROPICAUX 8'1“ ROMS in French No 1879. 13 Nov 81 pp 2889-2891

[Text] 0n 4 November 1981, President Ahidjo, as is his habit, ude a lengthy presenta-
tion of the Fifth Development Plan for Cameroon to the deputies. One cannot say that
there was any particular delay in finalizing the plan, since the Fourth Plan was pro-
mulgated in September 1976. after study by the Assembly.*

The chief of state began by confirming his comth to planning. which makes it
possible to coordinate the contribution of everyone and which thus presumes that all
administrations. collectives and groups expected to implement it will also be invited
to participate in the drafting of it.

Early in his address, the president of the republic assessed the two decades which
have elapsed rather than the Fourth Plan alone. and then in a later portion. he set
forth the guidelines for the new plan and the orientation for the 20 years to come.

Assessment of the 2 Decades Between 1960-1980

Why this assessment of 2 decades? 0n the one hand. because they were a period of
testing for the young Cameroonian nation, internally first of all, with the assertion
of the unity and the dignity of the country, and externally. because of the need for
the Cameroon to deal with an economic crisis during the second decade. Although such
remains for it to accomplish, the Cameroon has indeed passed these tests and is thus
prepared to undertake a new 20-year period which will take it to the year 2000.

Moreover, during the first 20 years. planning in the Cameroon set the doubling of the
real income per inhabitant as its goal. This goal has been more than achieved. In
fact. the per capita income increased from 21,500 CFA francs in 1960 to 187.000 in
1980-1981. representing 46,500 1961-1962 francs. This represents an increase of 2.2
times in constant francs. This goal reflected. among other things, the human concerns
in this planning based on planned liberalism. self-centered development. social jus-
tice and a policy of balanced development.

During this period. the "socioeconomic face of the Cameroon has been profoundly a1-
tered." First of all. there were changes pertaining to the population:

*Uhere the Fourth Plan for the Cameroon is concerned. see the 31 October 1980 issue
of MARCHFS TROPICAUX. p 2680. "The llplementation of the Fourth Plan—A Lag Difficult
to Overcome," and in our special issue entitled "The Cameroonian Market in 1980"
(MARCHBS TROPICAUX Z-I‘L' HEDITEPFJWEES, 7 October 1980, section on Cameroon, p 1968).

The success of Cameroonian young people in athletic performance. both within and
outside the country. reflects their dynamism and the promise they show. The chief
of state recalled that these social advances were possible thanks to the development
of the economy and the infrastructures.

First of all. he discussed agriculture. which maintained its contribution to the
gross domestic product at about 30 percent. No goals were sought: an increase in
production and a better standard of living for the rural masses. If the authorities
stressed export crops above all prior to independence. since the initiation of the
Green Revolution. the development of food crops has also been a goal.

In his assessment. the speaker discussed only livestock breeding. fishing and forestry.
Livestock breeding has on the whole retained its traditional nature. while the poultry
and swine-breeding sectors have been modernised to a greater extent.

Fishing evidenced growth until 1976-1977. and then declined because of "the defection
of certain shipowners." Work is already underway to reach the previous level again.
"Forestry production increased from 675,000 cubic neters to 1.350.000 cubic meters, a
half of which is processed locally." The Fourth Plan calls for 2.5 million cubic
meters. but that production was affected by the world recession. An effort was also
undertaken to protect the forest assets.

Next, industry: After the phase of replacing industries. the Cameroon undertook a
process of secondary integration. The growth has been strong during these 20 years:
production has increased by 12 percent per year. the turnover total by 15 percent and
investments by 19 percent.

The state sustained this effort through the activities of the National Investment
Company (SNI). which has now contributed capital to 80 enterprises and manages a
portfolio totaling more than 19 billion CPA francs for the state (1978 figures)-i.n
1975-1976, the SNI contributed to 58 enterprises and its portfolio totaled 11.9
billion CPA francs.

The chief of state spoke in particular detail about the energy sector. Hith an in-
stalled capacity of 337 megawatts (including 263 for Edea). the Cameroon produces

about 1.10 billion kwh. This figure has changed little since 1976-1975, but is ex-
pected to increase with the comissioning of the Song-Loulou Dam, which has already
begun production.

The president stressed that oil production is still modest (3.8 million tons in 1980-
1981). but it "covers our needs in the sector and earns appreciable financial re-
sources for us."

The infrastructures have developed greatly. Port traffic has tripled. In fact. the
figure for Douala. which handles 90 percent of this traffic. increased from 767,000
tons in 1960 to 2.5 million tons in 1977. This port now has a capacity of 7 million
tons, which could be increased to 15 million tons. Studios are under way with a view
to deepdwater ports in Victoria and Kribi (probably kocher du Loup).

For a number of years, the Cameroon has evidenced a desire for mastery in the trans-
portation facilities sector. with the creation of the Cameroon Shipping Lines, which
has purchased six ships and handles traffic of about 400,000 tons, and the utension
and modernization of the railroad network. Hhile the current traffic handled comes to
1.5 million tons per year, its capacity is expected to reach 8-10 million tons per
year. The highway network (in terms of km) has also developed.

In the large cities. the SOIUC. established in 1973. is currently transporting 50
million passengers. Its fleet is being modernized and its installations are being
expanded.

Air transport has multiplied tenfold. increasing from 100.000 passengers in 1960 to
more than a million now. The infrastructures and auxiliary equipment were the focus
of major investments during the fourth plan. As is known, Cameroon Airlines has made
a large transport purchase—a Boeing 7b7—and is working _to improve administration.
This company has just celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding.

Progress has been made in the postal and telecomnications sector. at least in the
extension of facilities.

Hotel capacity has increased from few than 900 beds in [960 to more than 8,000 in
[980-1981. Let us note that this growth has to do more with the large cities than
with the tourist routes within the country. Finally, the chief of state acknowledged
that domestic trade requires an organizational effort. He completed his assessment
by stressing that this growth gives the lie "to the defeatists and prophets of doom
and nostalgic detractors," and he acknowledged that this progress is due to the ef-
forts of the whole people and that the Cameroon has achieved a self-sustaining state
of growth.

Presentation of the Fifth Plan and the Next 20 Years

a. Mastery of the future and development from within. President Ahidjo began by
sketching a picture of the international situation. which is characterized by a de-
crease in international aid, an increase in protectionism, deterioration of the terms
of trade end many other inconvenient aspects and dangers, which threaten not only the
developing countries. but all of mankind as well.

Put in'another way. it is necessary to rely less and less on the generosity of others
and more and more on oneself. in a word "On our capacity to master the future." This
is the basis for the slogan of 'hastery" promlgated in connection with the congress
of the Cameroonian National Union (080) held in Bafoussam in February 1980.

This same concept is taken further with the term "development from within," which
seems to us to imply more than the term "self-centered development." In fact, de-
velopment from within seems narrower—this is our consent-and better founded on the
best of the people's resources. Moreover. it is explained a little farther on that
this endogenous development must be based on greater popular participation. This
then is the perspective orienting the lug-term (20 years) and medium-term (present
5-year period) economic and social projects.

Among the factors which must. be taken into account. demographic development ranks
first. In the year 2000, the population will reach 13 or 15 million. and the cities
will account for 56 percent of this population instead of the present 28 percent.

As a function of this population growth. President Ahidjo had already, in Bsfoussaa,
urged a policy based on the following five principles: balance between the urban and
rural sectors, improvement of the standard of living in both sectors. attention
focused on the problems in employment and training for that purpose. redistribution
of income and finally. avoidance of any threat to the food supply of the population,
in the cities in particular, due to the exodus from the countryside.

These principles, for example the balance between the cities and the countryside.
food supply for the population. and the income and standard of living of the rural
sector. which are dependent on the development of agriculture. are taken up again in
the Fifth Plan.

Prior to listing the main activities to be undertaken in agriculture and the other
sectors. the president set forth the goals for the two decades to come. Just as the

focus was on doubling real income during the first 2 decades, the focus in the coming
period will be upon (we have grouped goals together here):

«An increase in food production of 3 percent per year. still thanks to the Green
Revolution.

-"llea1th for all by the year 2000" (There should by then be one doctor for every
1,000 inhabitants).

--The training of the new Cameroonian citizen on various educational levels. By the
year 2,000, all children between 6 and lb years of age should be receiving education

enabling them to adapt to reality. Technical education will be given priority and

intensified. The decentralization and reorganisation of higher education will be
continued.

--Reduction in the disparity between the cities and the rural sector through the de-

velopment of infrastructures. and in particular the fuller extension of water and
electrical facilities.

Naturally. the president appealed for the support of all so that these goals can be
achieved.

b. Proceeding then to the activities to be undertaken. the president of the republic
discussed first of all the problen of income. "It will be a priority to guarantee
agricultural operators fair and remunerative prices. without however compromising the
effort made to improve the standard of living of urban consumers." This is the
dilemma involving the rural sector and the cities which is comparable to squaring the
circle. In our view. it is possible to act in both directions in such a way as to
reconcile the two concerns-intensification of agricultural production. and rational-
ization and improvement of marketing circuits.

For nonsgricultural income, a number of steps are planned. "The levels of wages in
the public and private sectors. on the one hand, and among the various wage sectors
on the other. must be brought closer together." In this connection. it seems that
for the lower wage levels. the private sector is lagging. relatively speaking. whereas
for the higher wage levels. it is in the lead. Let us recall that the elimination of
the third sector has been contemplated for several years. In addition. within the
framework of development from within. it is quite obvious that the government wants

to further staffing by natives of the Cameroon. Finally. an employment and manpower
office will be established.

Secondly, there is a national food plan within the Fifth Plan. In order to guarantee
self-sufficiency in food. the Fifth Plan is based on the following goals:

--Creation of a new type of relationship between the administration and the peasants,
and in order to achieve this. increasing the responsibility of each agricultural zone
by means of integrated structures, and developing the basic and advanced training of

rural development agents.

--And then. improvement of living conditions in the rural sector. but how? Through
increased productivity. a farm price policy (see above). while further on the presi-
dent discussed the organization of village communities. a subject with which he had
already dealt at the First Agricultural Show in Buea.

--Pinally. the last goal is "the mastery of production. marketing and processing of
our fern products." This goal also involves the secondary and tertiary sectors.

Livestock breeding and fishing were dealt with separately. 'Ths goal is to achieve
consumption of proteins of animal origin equivalent to 36 kg of beef per capita per
year." The average can be estimated at 25 kg for the preceding 5-year period. The
steps planned are classic and general. Let us mention. however. the development of

'11

fish breeding in the villages. No major innovation is planned in the forestry sector
either.

Thus industry has the task of processing local raw materials. creating jobs and giving
impetus to the economy. Consistent with the preceding plan. the new one stresses the
two following points above all: use and processing of the country's resources. whe-
ther in the energy. natural resources or raw materials sector. and giving impetus to
the small and medium-sized businesses and craftsmen.

One can note that this orientation favors a certain industrial dualism. because the
.extraction and processing of raw materials and natural resources generally requires
recourse to heavy capital sums.

How wil‘ this industrial growth be oriented?

The concern will be for integration (which does not moreover exclude subcontracting
and thus dualism). and for the reorganization and improvement of the industrial pic-
ture. It will probably involve limiting the near-monopoly Douala has on industry.
Along these same lines, there must also be technological research adapted to the
needs of the country. and finally. investments which create jobs must be given
priority. This plan places less stress on productivity.

The service sector will have two main concerns:
--thernslly. the promotion of the products of the Cameroon; and
-Domesticslly. greater mobility for people and goods.

President Ahidjo's speech stressed this second point: the hotel capacity must be
increased (an additional 3,000 rooms). the infrastructures linking various reasons
lust be developed. new port installations must be provided. and the realignment of
the Douala-Yaounde Railroad must be continued. Finally. "2,000 km of new roads will

be provided with heavy-duty surfacing."

0n the problem of territorial integration (linking the various regions). which goes
hand in hand with the problem of territorial development. the speaker mentioned two
other points. without going into detail: environmental protection, and dynamic and
functional urban development (MARCHBS TROPICADX has already reported on the urban de-
velopment in Yaounde and Douala under this Fifth Plan).

This increase in the national assets on various levels will make it possible to pro-
vide greater satisfaction of the basic human needs. On this point. the president
further discussed some of the seven goals listed above:

-"Health for all by the year 2000." achieved through a health network covering the
entire country. the reorganization of public health services. and the priority to be
given preventive medicine. "Stress will also be placed on aid to the handicapped and
the needy."

--Bach level of education should reflect progress and have an underlying ethic. and
the chief of state referred to certain basic reasons in this connection: there is a

8 ONLY
need not only to train competent cadres and vorkars. but also to wage a battle against

certain scourges-vunsmployment. the exodus from the rural sector and juvenile delin-
quency in the cities.

In the cultural realn. the Fifth Plan seeks to encourage greater activity. production
and creativity. Curiously. no mention was made of television. for which plans were
already included in the Fourth Plan. Perhaps the text of the new plan is sore expli-
cit on this point. but it is a fact that there are technical obstacles to this pro-

ject. If the automatic telephone system is overloaded and unreliable. this works
against the development of television. -

c. After setting forth the guidelines and the projects. the speaker discussed
financing. which we compare below with that for the Fourth Plan (estimates).

A little further on. the president thanked the countries and the international organ-
izations which have aided the Cameroon and are continuing to aid it. the following
table clearly shows the declining percentage of foreign public aid. The role of the
private sector scene to have been underestimated in the preceding plan.

The president stressed the increased effortsbeingfocused on rural development.

These investments and these efforts should lead to an annual rate of growth of 7
percent in real terms. which would make it possible to achieve a gross domestic pro-

duct of 2 trillion in 1986. In other words. the gross domestic product for 1981
comes to about 1.6 trillion to 1.5 trillion.

Speaking again of 1986. exports should total 665 billion and the coverage rate should
exceed 100 percent, thanks in particular to oil. In 1979-1980. exports came to 300.2
billion, with a coverage rate of 96.2 percent. The gross available household income

should increase by 5.7 percent per year. as compared to the 6.5 percent for which the
Fourth Plan called.

The president concluded his remarks by appealing to all for self-discipline, which is
necessary to counteract the evil effects of external disturbances. In this connection.
he announced "that a reform of our structures is required. with a view to fixing re-
sponsibility on those pursuing development and eliminating the main bottlenecks on all
levels." This was doubtless a reference to the delays in decisions on the administra-
tive level and in certain services.

After providing these figures and technical details. the president discussed a more
philosophic view of matters. quoting Alvin Toffler ("Putureshock"). Thus he responded
to those who might reproach the Cameroon for a certain laxity in its rejection of more
rigid and technocratic planning. Preparations for the future must evidence a certain
flexibility. because it is necessary to take into account both the potential of the
country and the general consensus.

Put in another way, the president was thereby announcing new requirements and a de-
velopment in the drafting of plans for the future. In this connection. both a future
and a situational approach will be developed. consistent always with the desire to
seek mastery in development.

And because preparations for the future also depend on a general consensus. it is
necessary to mobilize the people further through the country's institutions, in par-
ticular the state and the party. The speaker was not thereby indicating any demo-
cratization of political life.

The president ended his remarks with an expression of faith in a better future.
Throughout this address, he reported. in his own fashion. the inadequacies requiring
correction and the progress made.

UBAC RBPORT--In fiscal 1979, the Banking Union in Central Africa [UBAC] was
severely disrupted by the events which resulted in a change of political regime.
The balance sheet on 31 December 1979 totaled 7.2 billion CPA francs. The total
figure for customers' assets (checking accounts, demand deposits and time deposits)
was 2.9 billion CPA francs. registering a slight increase of 3.4 percent compared
to the end of 1978. Meanwhile, the volume of liabilities (commercial portfolios
and advances) showed a slight increase with a current total of 6.1 billion CPA francs.
Not included in the balance sheet are liabilities from endorsements and securities
and guaranteed credits for customers totaling 1.1 billion CPA francs. After
amortization. deposits and taxes, the fiscal year ended with a net worth of 96.6
million CPA francs which is 54.8 million down from the previous fiscal year. A
general Meeting held in 24 April 1980 decided to distribute a dividend of 15 per-

BIDI’S 1980 FISCAL YEAR REPORTED
Paris HARCHES TROPICAUX ET MEDITERRANEKNS in French No 1979,13 Nov 81 p 2881

[Text] In fiscal 1979-1980. the Ivorian Bank for Industrial Develop-ant (BIDI)
provided 11.2 billion CPA francs worth of new short-tern and long-tern loans, a
figure representing an increase of 95 percent conpared to the previous fiscal year.

The leI's policy trend was to concentrate its help on e linited number of enter-
prises of good standing. Thus, 10 or so conpaniee borrowed 78 percent of all the
loans and these coepanies are in the following lines of business: food industry
(25 percent), real estate companies (25 percent), chenical industry and fats and
oils (23 percent), transportation and distribution of goods (13 percent).

In fiscal 1979-1980. BIDI's main financing operations involved the following enter-
prises:

--SODESUCR£ [Coupeny for the Developnent of Sugar Cane Plantations and the Indus-
trialization and Marketing of Sugar]: a participation of 8.33 percent in a long-
tern credit of 12 billion CPA francs given by e consortiun.

--PALHINDUSTRIB: a participation of 5 percent in a funding progren of 17 billion
CPA francs of which 10 billion will be provided by local banks.

--SICOCI [expansion unknown]: a loan of 2.2 billion CPA francs to finance two new
housing development programs.

-Ivorian Refining Company: loans totaling 1.6 billion CPA francs to increase its
refining capacity to 6 million tons of crude. This project involves a total invest-
ment of 100 billion CPA francs.

~-Ivorian Company for the Grinding of 011 Seeds and the Refining of Vegetable Oils
(TRITURAP): participation of 600 million CPA francs in a loan of 2.1 billion CPA
francs to build a soap factory.

--Abidjan Transport Company (SOTRA): a loan of 700 million CPA francs representing
8.33 percent of an investment project for depots, repair shops and for the purchase
of passenger boats servicing the lagoons.

Other loans were given to various production enterprises besides carrying on with
the policy of helping small and nediun-size national businesses.

Since the BIDI was created in 1965. it has given the Ivorian scone-y help amounting
to a total of 51.1 billion CPA francs, involving 634 operations.

In terns of percentages, the total figure for these loans is distributed as follovs:
textile industry (10.7 percent). food industry (15 percent), tinber industry (8.5
percent), transportation and distribution (10.6 percent); electrical engineering
and metalworks (7 percent), hotel and tourist industry (4 percent), chemical
industry and fats and oils (11.7 percent), fishing and refrigeration (6.6 percent),
services (9.1 percent). energy and water (3 percent). construction and public works
(8.7 percent), building nateriale (2 percent). plastics (1.2 percent), cash crops
(0.6 percent) and miscellaneous (3.6 percent).

In the geographic distribution of the BIDI's aid. the Abidjan region accounts for
81 percent and is followed by the central region (8 percent), the south (5.1 per-
cent). the west (3 percent), the north (2.5 percent) and the east (0.5 percent).

In the balance sheet drawn up on 30 Septeeber 1980. the outstanding connitnents from
custoners totaled 20.5 billion CPA francs and the chapter of bonds and shares

amounted to 1.2 billion CPA francs. In addition to this. unpaid and disputed

accounts amounted to 1.6 billion CPA francs, vith 32 percent of this sun being covered.

The 8101's assets consist of its stock (2.1 billion CPA francs), nadiul and long-
tern loans contracted in various foreign currencies (18.9 billion) and rediscount
facilities in the Central Bank of the Heat African States (0.7 billion at the end
of Septenber 1980).

The 8101's stock is divided along the Ivorian state (21.1 percent), the Central

Bank of the West African States 12.0 percent). the Central Fund for Economic Coopera-
tion (10.7 percent). the International Finance Corporation (7.1 percent). the French

STUDY FORECASTS PETROLEUM SELF-SUFPICIBNCY BY 1983
Paris HARCHES TROPICAUX ET MEDITERRANEERS in French No 1879,13 Nov 81 p 2881

(Article: "011: Towards Self-Sufficiency in 1983"]

[Excerpts] Starting in 1983, the Ivory Coast will produce enough petroleun to
satisfy its needs and, eventually, it will becons an exporting country, according
to a study on the scone-y of the Ivory Coast sponsored by the Ministry of Informa-
tion and conducted in cooperation with the Ministry of Economy. Finance and Plan.

Right now. Abidjan has the largest refinery in French-speaking Africa and its
initial production of 700,000 tons has now reached 4 Iillion tons. The SIR
[Ivorian Refining Conpany] exports to neighboring countries (Mali. Upper Volta and
Niger and Benin).

As for petroleun exploration in the Ivory Coast. it started some 10 years ago but
it was only in 1977 that the existence of important oil fields was firmly estab-
lished.

At that tine. President Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast officially announced
that the £880 and SHELL conpaniea had discovered an oil field called Belier. 15 km
off Grand Bassam (about 40 kn east of Abidjan toward the border with Ghana).- This
oil field went into operation last year and will have an initial production of

600,000 tons.

Other offshore explorations have been conducted between Jacqueville and Grand Lahou
(east of Abidjan) and they seem to be particularly promising. Initial teats
indicated yields ranging between 2.000 and 4.900 barrels a day and point to the
presence of large reserves of natural gas (between 40,000 and 60,000 cubic meters

a day).

Additional drilling to confirm these findings show that it may be possible to pump
as much as 20,000 barrels a day. representing an annual production of 1 million tons

of petrol per well.

This oil field, called Espoir, is operated by a consortium led by Phillips Petro-
leun and including AGIP [Italian Petroleum Enterprise], SEDCO [expansion unknown]
and PETROCI [Ivorian Petroleum Company]

Punping this oil from a depth of more than #00 neters will be a difficult and costly
operation since an offshore drilling platform requires investments ranging from 2.6
to a billion CPA francs.

the CSCE (Senegalese Foreign Trade Center) is organising four other trade missions
to Ivory Coast (30 November—5 December 1981), Nigeria (6-12 December), Saudi Arabia
(21-26 November), and India (22 November—l December). The first three missions
(Abidjan, Lagos. Jiddah) were nde possible with the help of financing from the
European Development Fund which, as part of its trade promotion program, in this
way grants by no means negligible financial assistance to economic operators.

The Ivorian mission is a very special one for Senegal because Ivory Coast is Senegal's
second ranking trade partner after France.

As for the mission to Saudi Arabia, it must be noted that a preparatory mission
went to Riyadh already in June for the purpose of identifying the possibilities
offered on the Saudi market for certain Senegalese products, determining the
potential demand and the way in which it could be met. and checking on competition
prices and the very specific requirements of the market. .

The trade mission to Nigeria is essentially concerned with agricultural equipment
and fishing products.

The Senegalese economic operator mission to India is a part of the effort to step up
trade and industrial cooperation between these two countries on the basis of the
steps taken by the two parties to promote such relations.

The CSCE in particular includes representatives from the free industrial zone of
Dakar, from SONICOA [Maritime and Industrial Company of the Heat Coast of Africa].
of SUPER. and of SOTIBA-S‘mPAI-‘RIC [African Dyeing, Bleaching, Finishing, and
Printing Company].

The mission is to identify enterprises capable of providing Senegal with financial
and technical aid. Some of the areas identified include machine-tools, food products.
agricultural equipment, chemical products and dyes, and electronic equipment, trans-
portation equipment, etc. SOFISBDIT [Senegalese Finance Company for the Develop-
ment of Industry and Tourism] is also developing relations with the Indian Indus-
trial Development Bank. India is a big buyer of phosphate rock from Senegal and

is currently Senegrl‘s partner in the big industrial project involved 168 (Chemical
Industries of Senegal).

AGRICULTURAL PLANTING, HARVESTING CAHPAIGN 'PAIRLY 6000'

Paris M30113 TROPICAUX ET axon-ems in French No 1879 13 Nov 81 p 2877
[Text] A Fairly Good Farming Year

If one were to describe in a few words the stain features of the 1981 rainy season
in Senegal, one could say" quite an early good start, a slight lag in the Senegal
River Valley, a preaature end, insufficient rainfall in general, although it was
above the average for the 2 previous years.

Until July, conditions were generally good but in August and September there was
less rain than usual. Crops of tall plants (millet, sorghum and corn), which re-
quire nore rainfall than the peanut crops. suffered when they were in the stage of
pollination and fornation of grains. When the rains started again in mid-September,
many stands cane down because the dried stens were brittle. The prenature end of
the rains somewhat reduced the harvest prospects. However, heavy rains in the
country's central and southern regions replenished the ground water and aade it
possible to adequately reduce the salt content in the Isngrove swans of Casanance,
offering good prospects for the planting of rice seedlings.

Harvest Prospects

Seeds and fertilizers were distributed on tine although in anounts and of a quality
which were not always satisfactory.

It is paradoxal that this tinely distribution had negative effects on sole of the
peanut crops. Hany far-era received a selected variety of seeds, the 55,437
variety. which has many advantages: a short cycle of 90 days which means that it
will not be affected if the rains stop early; resistance to drought and to some
pests; good oil contnet (1.9 percent) and good productivity if planted observing the
right density. But this variety does not have a dormant period and the seeds could
germinate if they are not harvested in tine and properly stored. Iarners planted
the 55,437 seeds too early and lay harvest then too late. ‘Ihis is why the Conany
for Agricultural Develop-eat and Popularization (SBVKDA) has launched an education
campaign with illustrated paephlets to teach farmers how to accelerate the harvesting
particularly on wet soils and how to store the peanuts after they are harvested,
arranging then on trays or piling then up in well ventilated risks and, also, how
to dry the peanuts if they get caught by late rains.

FOR (ll-11¢ 1M. ITSl-I ONLY

Right now, it is difficult to give exact estimated figures for the peanut harvest.
There is reason to hope that it will reach the 800,000-ton figure and with 120,000
tons needed for seeds and between 150,000 and 200,000 tons for national consump-
tion, this means that about 500,000 tons will be left for the oilmilla in the best
of the cases.

The acreage planted with millet was larger than the one devoted to peanut crops.
Since millet has a lower yield, this crop is expected to product 650,000 tons which
will be enough to meet the demand. The same applies to corn where the harvest is
expected to yield 65,000 tons of corn.

As for rice, it is hard to give any estimates at this stage. The Company for the
Development and Exploitation of the Delta Region and River Valley (SBAD) is counting
on about 32,000 tons being produced in the Senegal River Valley. The Casamance
region could produce about 80,000 tons. This represents an estimated total of just
over 100,000 tons of rice, barely one-fourth of the amount needed. In order to cut
back on rice imports, which are a heavy burden on the country's budget, an inter-
ministerial neeting held on 11 September decided that those merchants who get a
quota of rice must also sell equivalent amounts of millet.

Successful Marketing

Successful marketing operations are just as necessary as the right amount of rain

to achieve a satisfactory farming year. The three subjects discussed by the inter-
ministerial meeting of ll September were financing. regrouping of pickup locations
and actions to fight parallel marketing operations and, therefore, to protect the
preferential status given to SONOCOS [National Company for the Marketing of Oleaginous
Plants in Senegal], SONAR [National Company for the Supply of Oil Mills] end 8313
[Boal Electrical and Industrial Company].

The 1,829 cooperatives which form the National Union of Senegalese Agricultural
Cooperatives are in charge of the first operation, which is to increase production.
The operation started on 1 October for grains and on 2 November for peanuts. The
National Company for the Marketing of Oleaginous Plants in Senegal (SONACOS) pro-
vides these cooperatives with advance credits amounting to 35 percent of the
estimated harvest in areas of the interior and to 50 percent in the peripheral
areas (Sine Salons. Eastern Senegal and Casamance).

The issue of regrouping pickup points so that the scale of charges does not go beyond
15 CPA francs per kilo was discussed but the government postponed any adoption of
measures regarding this matter to include it in the general reorganization of the
cooperatives. Undoubtedly, transportation costs are likely to increase significantly
since a number of cooperatives have a very low production and their crops will have
to be transported over a long distance.

The authorities have decided to act against illegal marketing operations and against
products being taken out of the country. The presence of Senegalese troops in
Gambia could help to establish a more effective control until such a time when a
Senegalese-Gambian customs union and even a monetary union is set up, this being

the only satisfactory solution to the annoying problem of smuggling.

The government has decided to build up stocks of. seeds for next season with the
help of an BBC loan and this will have the effect of lowering financial costs.

Truck farming production is quite good thanks to satisfactory anounts of rain. The
authorities expect the country to be self-sufficient in potatoes and onions (priority
has been given to varieties which keep longer). this will represent savings of 1.5
billion CPA £rancs.' The govern-ant seems to be noving towards a certain amount of
protectionism in this sector. Senegal should be able to nest its basic needs re-
garding truck fareing produce and should substantially cut back on costly imports.
Exports, particularly out of the season. should increase with the ancouragenent
brought to truck farming of cash crops and with the prompt start of a project to
settle young truck farmers in the Niayes region between Dakar and Saint-Louis.

In the stockraieing sector. the situation is satisfactory and there was no proble-
in bridging the gap. Stockhreeders have been encouraged to take advantage of a
situation in which there is plenty of grass growing and to step up their harvesting
of hay to create stocks of fodder for their cattle.

Sunning up, the relatively good agricultural year should help improve Senegal's
economic situation.

GOVERNMENT-SOCOCIH AGREEMENT CONCERNING CEMENT INCREASE
Paris HARCHBS TROPICAUX ET HBDITERRANEBNS in French No 1880, 20 Nov 81 p 294‘

.[Text] The Senegalese JOURNAL OFFICIBL on 5 September published the text of the
agreement between the Republic of Senegal and SOCOCIH [Best African Cement
Companyl-Industries (a corporation with a capital of 195.03 million CFA [African
Financial Community] at Rufisque) involving the project to expend its cement pro-
duction capacities, a program for which the European.1nvestment Bank has granted
the company a loan of 3 billion CPA (see HARCEBS TROPICADX ET HEDITIRRANEBNS, 6
November 1981, p 2817).

SOCOCIH-Industries, established on 7 August 1978, with the majority participation
of nationals of Senegal, is to increase its output capacity from 465,000 tons to
825,000 tons of cement per year to supply the Senegalese market until 1990 and

to work toward a resumption of its exports.

Under the terms of the agreement, the company provides priority guarantee for the
supply of the domestic market to the detriment, if necessary. of the export market.
The Senegalese government in turn guarantees exclusive rights to the satisfaction
of the needs of the domestic market up to the amount of 825,000 tons. The company
will completely remodel its installations to do this job.

According to the draft submitted by the company, the cost, after inclusion of con-
solidation emissions, has been estimated at 15. 21 billion francs CPA (firm price,
not revisnble for a turnkey contract; to be signed with the contractor, Creusot-
Loire enterprise on 25 April 1981 at the latest).

The price established for the actual contract will have to be submitted to the
government which is represented by the minister of economy and finances who will
give his approval after coordinating with money lenders.

After the inclusion of an amount for unexpected contingencies and intermediate in-
terest payments in the operating fund, the total financing requirements have been
estimated at 18.6 billion francs CPA. The work will be completed within 30 months,
starting from the entry into force of the loans necessary for the completion of

the investment. At the end of that time, the plant is to be started up.

The company's in-houue funds should be on the order of 252 of the investment cost
by the time the plant is started up on an industrial basis, in other words, 4.12
billion CPA. This figure includes the company's current in-house funds, all of the
net operating earnings until the date of industrial commissioning, as well as the
repayment of the PBS bills and the P83 bill exemptions which will be granted the
enterprise in the can:cxt of the investment program and a new stockholder contri-
bution in the amount of 2.08 billion CPA.

JAPANESE DONATE FOOD AID-~Japan has made Senegal a gift of about 1050 million CPA
francs, earmarked for the purchase and partial transportation of 2,500 tons of
Japanese rice, under the terms of an agreement signed on 10 November at Dakar
between Hr Ouamane Seck, Senegalese economy and finance minister, and Mr Chiyuki

1.09 million dollars for the' purchase of 5,000 tons of rice and in December 1980
it gave 260 million yen for the purchase of (0,000 tons of wheat. The minister
finally emphasized that the actions of the Japanese Government are essentially
aimed at the fields of agriculture and fishing but also touch the transportation '
sector where Japan in particular contributed to the construction of the Dongs-

BIAo-SENECAL Ra?0RT—-Under the country's current conditions of econonic and finan-
cial crisis, the BIAD [International Bank of West Africel-Senegsl, which since
January 1980 has rejoined the banking network of the BIAO, tried during its first
fiscal year to continue improving the nature of its ventures. On 30 Septeaber, its
balance sheet totaled $1.1 billion CPA francs. Custoasrs' assets (deaand and tile
deposits) totaled 2&.S billion CPA francs. Liabilities (connercial portfolios,
credits and advances) anounted to 52.7 billion CPA francs; the bank had to turn to
external funds to finance its operations. The recovery of debts was proceeding at

a satisfactory rate. Not included in the balance sheet were liabilities fro-
endorsenents and securities and the opening of guaranteed credits to customers

which amounted to 5.2 billion CPA francs. The category of operating expenses
included the cost of repayaant of external loans and higher general expenses. After
amortization, deposits and taxes, the net worth stood at 3.3 billion CPA francs at
the end of the fiscal year and the Board of Directors deciced to carry it forward
again. After the fiscal year had ended. in Decelber 1980, the capital stock was
increased from 2 to 3.7 billion CPA francs by a note issue reserved to the Senegalese
state which now holds 35 percent of the stock. The International Bank of Heat

FUEL CONSUHPTION-As previously reported, the largest increase in Nigerian energy con-
sumption in 1980 was seen for oil products, up 17.2 percent over 1979. This consump-
tion was distributed by products as follows (in millions of tons. with the 1979 fig-
ures in parentheses): gasoline--3,014 (2.515); kerosene--l.062 (1.020); gas-oil-
2,126 (1,707); fuel oil-706 (656); and miscellaneous-678 (574). These come to a
total of 7.586.000 tone as compared to 6,476,000 in 1979. Since prices remained stable
in 1980, the distribution companies therefore saw substantial increase in their turn-
over totals thanks to the volume of sales. For the five companies quoted on the Lagos
stock exchange. the turnover totals for the fiscal period ending on 31 December were

as follows (in millions of naira. with the 1979 figures in parentheses): AGIP [Italian

OIL PRODUCTION--The oil production of the various companies operating in Nigeria, for
which we gave the figures for the first half of the year in our 18 September issue

Petroleum Enterprise], 139.6; Pan Ocean, 7.3; Phillips, 1.1; Shell. 655.3; and Texaco,
36.7. As can be seen. because of the drop which occurred in August (708,000 barrels
per day). the average for the first 9 months. 1.¢73.soo,ooo barrels per day, fell be-
low the average for the first 6 months. which was 1,707,300,000 barrels per day. Thus
production by Shell increased from 899,300 barrels per day during the first half of
the-year to 755,300 barrels per day during the first 9 months. It should be noted
that its production dropped to only 277,000 barrels per day in August. It was already
up to 513,000 barrels per day again by September. and in October the level reached was
612,000 barrels per day. This company remains the largest operator in the country,

[Text] Uganda arranged on 18 November for the rescheduling of a part of its debt to
six major industrial nations over a 10~year period. This information was included in
a statement published following a meeting organised in Paris by France, in which the
participating countries included, in addition to France. the United States, the FIG,
Italy, Japan and Great Britain. Switzerland. the m. the UNCTAD, the BBC and the
OBCD sent observers (HARCEBS 1.110le m HEDITKRRANEENS. 20 Nov. p 2957).

The statement explained that along with the 10-year repayment period. there will be a
5-year period of grace. “here back debts are concerned, repayment will be made over
8 years, with a grace period of lo years.

The statement noted that the representatives of the participating countries "were aware
of the reconstruction efforts undertaken by the government of Uganda, and they were
pleased by the implementation of an economic and financial program" which won the sup-
port of a confirmation agreement on the part of the International Monetary Fund on

5 June 1981 (providing a credit line of 112,500,000 SDR [Special Drawing Rights] for
the period between June 1981 and July 1982).

The special representative of President Hilton Obote. Ephraim Kamuntu. explained to

the participants at the meeting that Uganda's foreign debt totaled 850 million dollars.
Now the rescheduling his country sought involved only 72 million dollars, covering the
payments to be made between June 1982 and June 1983 on debts contracted with the indus-
trial countries or international and multilateral organizations, and also Arab coun-
tries (38 million dollars, including 13 million for Libya) and Eastern European nations.

"He need 500 million dollars and a mini-Marshall Plan for our short-term reconstruc-
tion program," Mr Kamuntu further said. adding that "the balance of payments deficit
for 1.5 years was about 150 million dollars."

A meeting of representatives of the lending countries including those participating in
the Paris meeting, as well as Arab countries including Iraq and Algeria. and other in-
dustrial nations, was scheduled for the 19th at the IMP headquarters. Hr. Kamuntu
said that it was not a formal meeting but rather "a gathering of countries friendly

to Uganda to enable us to appeal to them for urgent aid in order to sustain our
balance of payments."

GOODS AT HOHBASA PORT-The managing director of the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA).

last month, that steps had been taken to speed up the removal of Ugandan goods to-
taling some 20 million shillings in value which had been held in the Kilindini Fort
in Mombasa for 3 years. These goods were ordered in the Idi Amin Dada era and since
the former president was ousted, no one has claimed them. They include in particu-
lar substantial quantities of replacement parts for vehicles of various types. Re-
moval of the goods has been delayed by the multiple talks which have been necessary
between the governments of the two countries. '

Hr hturi advised the Ugandan government to make more use of containers in the future
for goods in transit in the port. and he suggested that a container storage facility
be built in Uganda itself. The Ugandan diplomat expressed satisfaction with the good-
will shown by the Kenyan port body, and he congratulated the workers at the port on
the speed with which they have handled the shipment of Ugandan coffee in all cases.

He expressed the view that sales of this product will exceed the initial estimates of
2.7 million sacks this year. [Text] [Paris MARCHBS TROPICAUX ET HBDITERRANBENS in

FOREIGN DEBT DISCUSSED-Hinister of Finance Bphrahim Kamuntu and four other high
officials in his department arrived in Paris on 15 November to participate in nego—
tiations on the rescheduling of the Ugandan foreign debt. Because of the chaotic
borrowing policy pursued under the regime of ldi Amin Dads, neither the total amount
of the foreign debt nor the percentage of the gross domestic product of the country
spent on the debt service annually are accurately known. The FRO. Great Britain,
Denmark and Sweden canceled the official debts contracted by Kampala with them at
the beginning of the year. It is believed that the Ugandan government officials
hope to obtain agreement from the governments represented in Paris on a rescheduling

and postponement of the official debts and the loans guaranteed by the government.
The participants in the Paris meeting are also said to be hopeful of being able to

its gross domestic product which lea-pale must allocate annually for repayment of it.
Let us recall that the International Monetary Fund, whose deputy director for Africa.

TRADE WITH FRANCE IN 1980 REPORTED
Paris HARCBES TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANEENS in French No 1879, 13 Nov 81 p 2895

[Text] In the course of 1980, French imports fron Zaire totaled 736,600,000 French
francs (as cospared to 703,100,000 in 1979), accounting for 0.13 percent of all
French imports. Zaire remains the main supplier of raw copper to France, with a
total of 11,313 tons for 1980, although this figure reflects a rather substantial de-
cline (-31 percent) in comparison to 1979 (16,631 tons). It should however be noted
that the total tonnage of raw copper purchased throughout the world by France in 1980
was down 16 percent from the figure for the preceding year (17,896 tone as compared
to 21,258 tons). In addition to copper, Zaire's main exports to France include cacao,
coffee, rubber and palm oil.

We night add that according to a document released by the French ambassador to Zaire,
although the products Zaire exports are subject to major price variations, the total
and the structure of its exports to France still showed great stability in 1980 in
relation to the preceding year. Three important sectors did in fact remain stable:
coffee (600,600,000 French francs in 1979 and 600,900,000 in 1980). rubber (26,600,000
in 1979 and 27,100,000 in 1980) and refined oil products (16,500,000 in 1979 and
16,100,000 in 1980). Only the metals sector shows a substantial increase (218,600,000
francs in 1979 and 256,100,000 in 1980).

The "vegetable oils and animal fats" category, on the other hand, showed the greatest
decline (13,700,000 francs in 1979 and 2,100,000 in 1980). This drop was probably due
to the reduction in Zaire's production of palm oil.

French exports to Zaire came to a total of 527,600,000 French francs in 1980 (as coma
pared to 625,100,000 in 1979), representing 0.11 percent of the total of French sales
throughout the world.

The trade balance between France and Zaire thus shows a surplus of 207 million French
francs in favor of Zaire (as compared to 77 million in 1979). The "utility vehicles"
category, with s tatal of 92,700,000 francs, became the leading export category in
French exports in 1980 following the signing of the contract between Renault Indus-
trial Vehicles and the SOTRAZ (80,800,000 francs in 1979). The vehicles (utility
vehicles, private passenger cars, replacement parts) accounted for 28.5 percent of
all French exports to Zaire in 1980.

The "professional electrical and radioelectrical equipment" category. which has
ranked first in recent years, saw a sharp decline in 1980 (91.2 million francs in

1979 and 63.6 million francs in 1980). folloving a decline in the deliveries by the

French Thomson company to the land teleconnunications stations which are now in
operation.

0n the other hand, a very definite increase in certain other categories was seen,
including "nitrate fertilizers" (3.3 million francs in 1979 and 16.9 million francs
in 1980). "public works equipment" (4.7 million francs in 1979 and 10.6 million in
1980), and "refined oil products" (18.8 million in 1979 and 30.7 million in 1970).

In conclusion, the document from the French embassy noted that in 1980. a reclassi-
fication and consolidation of French exports was seen because the inﬂammation of
the major contracts signed by the two countries in 1975 and 1976 came to an end and

the principal new financing (financial protocol, participation of the Central Fund
for Economic Cooperation) was not yet functional.

HOMES OHNBD BY HOBUTU IN BELGIUM LISTED
Paris AFRIQUB-ASIB in French No 252. 9-22 Nov 81 pp 26-27

[Text] "Everything belongs to Hobutu here. Sir." you will be told if you should pass
through the beautiful Halloon village of Bhode-Saint-Genese. en route to Brussels.
The natives make no distinction between the dictator of Zaire and the members of his
entourage who. taken together. are in fact the owners of the richest lands in this
locality. which is famous for its luxurious vacation homes.

In Brussels you will be shown the Josephine House. another of hobutu's properties. at
327 Tervuren Avenue, a three-story building with a facade some 20 meters wide. But if
you want to admire the chateaus of the former sergeant in the Belgian Colonial Police
in the Congo, you will have to go to Uccle, a commune in the Greater Brussels area.

or to Namur. The first of thesechateausis located at é9-Sl Prince d'Orange Avenue in
Uccle. along with its grounds, stable and auxiliary building. Obviously, you could
not gain entrance to it.

The Frocourt Chateau in Namur is protected from the curious by its vast grounds and a
broad body of water. Sese Seko owns other properties in or around the Belgian capital
as well. such as that for example at 51 Marshal hey Avenue, or that at No 2 Avenue de
la Ramee. although the latter. a sumptuous villa. is held in the name of his dear un-
cle, Litho.

In Greater Brussels there are 26 buildings which belong directly to Hobutu or to his
relatives and front men. But if he seems to prefer Belgium. he does not limit himself
to it. He also owns properties at 20 Avenue Foch in Paris. in Manton. on the shore of
Lake Leman. in Dakar. in Abidjan, etc.

where was he able to find the sums required to purchase such chateaus. these buildings
which represent a veritable fortune?

Billions of Dollars .

Hell, in fact. he had many sources from which to choose. He could have recourse to
the funds of numerous companies over which he has sovereign control: the Zairian
Company for the Marketing of Ores (SOZACDM): the Zairian Shipping Company (CH2); the
water and electricity distribution company (SNELREGIDESO)} the Zairian National Rail-
road Company (SNCZ); the HIBA (Bakwanga Mining Company], the Diamond Exploitation and
Marketing Company; the General Quarries and Mines Company (GBCAHINBS) (copper, cobalt,
zinc. cadmium, manganese. gold and silver); and the General Ores Company.

But, probably for reasons of convenience. he has formed the habit of taking funds

direct from the Bank of Zaire. In this way. according to the reports of parliamen-
tary emissions for the 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979 fiscal years, he personally ends
away with more than 50 billion gold francs in foreign exchange (Belgian. French and

Swiss francs and 0.5. dollars). His relatives needed no less than 10 billion during
the same period.

The reports of the parliamentary co-issions have never been challenged. Moreover,
this represents only a small part of the nisappropriations which Kobutu carried out.
And when the financial people in Brussels or elsewhere, politicians. African or
European diplomats estimate the fortune of the dictator of Zaire at billions of dol-
lars, one can believe then, for they generally tend to understate the truth- They
agree, moreover. on the fact that by himlf he could pay off a large part of the
Zairian public debt.

In this issue. AFRIQUE-ASIB is beginning a series on the conponente in nobutu's for-
tune. one which he amassed by driving one of the richest countries in the world into
ruin and a living people into intolerable poverty. with which the allies, supporters
and acconplices of the dictator are willing to go along.
