'ASAHI' 0N TENSION IN SRV-PRC BORDER AREAS 0N EVE 0F TALKS
Tokyo ASAHI SHINBUN in Japanese 12 Apr 79 Morning Edition p 7 on
[Article by Ishikawa]

[Text] Hanoi, ll Apr-~This correspondent visited Lang Son Province on
10 and ll April to personally feel the extraordinary tension that now
prevails in border areas with the opening of the Sino-Vietnnncse vice
ministerial talks at hand.

Lang Son City did not sustain so much destruction as Cao Bang did, as the
Chinese troops which found their way into the city on a March pulled out
next day. Nevertheless, most of the buildings such as hospitals. post
offices and hotels were destroyed. Dong Dang. located 3 has from the
border, was a deserted place and not a soul was seen there.

A large number of Vietnanese troops were entrenched in hills around Dong Dang.
Residents in nearby villages also had evacuated and the border areas of
Long Son Province were in a semicombat state.

Minorities account for 70 percent of the province's total population of
680,000. The Chinese invasion caused 200,000 residents to evacuate;
only 60,000 of then including women and militiamen have returned so far.

Railway stations in Lang Son Province were still crowded with people
evacuating to safer places fron border areas. This correspondent's request
for permission to travel to Yuui Pass on the border was denied by the
provincial military command for the reason that it is not advisable to
irritate the Chinese side with the opening of the vice ministerial talks

at hand.

[Interview vith Pha- Van Dong by PARIS HA‘l'ca, in hanoi; date not given]

[Text] Our special correapondent. Jean-Claude Labbe. experienced the
recent Sine-Vietnam“ var fro- the Vietnaleae aide. The prise ainiater
received his in aanoi and anmrad hie queationa.

PARIS HATCH: Since the (all of Phnoa Penh. Vietnam haa been aharply cri-
ticired throughout the world. Several countriea have cut off the econoaic
aid that they were giving you. after accuaing Vietnan of having annexed
Kaapuchea. Vietna- eeena to have become iaola:ed on the international
acene. including rejection by nonaligned countriea aa well an certain
aocialiat countriaa that yeaterday. however. uere the atauncheat of upper-
tera of Vietnaa. What are your explanationa?

Phaa Van Dong: Your queation in not a aerioue one. You very well know
that an enlightened public rejoiced at the collapaa of the regiae of gene-
cide in Kanpuchaa and the and of a war fraught with conaequencaa that waa
raging on the aouthvaat border of our country.

At the preaent tine, all progreaaive people are aligned with on in an
caphatic denmciation of the ignoble var carried out by expanaioniat circlea
in Peking againat our country.

No. Re are not iaolatad! Juat the oppoaite. He have on our aide people
who love liberty. juatica. and peace. We are arching along in the direc-
tion of hiatory. Our atruggle ia the atruggle of people againat inparialian,
reaction. and war. Our victory in unqueationable!

PARIS HAM: The Iain Kanpuchaan leadera have ranained on the apot and
have organized a var of reaiatanca. aupported by China. A big national
union front vaa recently for-ed by Pol Pot.

In your opinion. to what extent it thia raaiatance capable of regaining
power?

What in your analyeia of the preaant eituation in Kanpuchea?

Phan Van Dong: He know what ia occurring in Kaepuchee better than you.
Pol Pot-lang 8ary'a govern-ant hea been overturned by all of the people
of Kanpuchea. who are now working to obliterate it cmletely. That ia an
irreveraible evolution that acoffa at the efforta and illuaiona of thoae
who would like to overturn the courae of hiatory. In ahort. the people
of Kanpuchea. having anerged a the victor in a heroic revolution. are
now matter of their daetiny. The People'a Revolutionary Comcil. the only
true and legal repreaantativa of the people of Kanpuchaa. ie now in
control and ahinietration of the entire country.

PARIS Harm: Many obeervera believe that the fall of Phnoa Penh ia the
coneecretion of the foraation of the Indochineae Federation directed by
Hanoi. and that auch a federation ie part of the Soviet etratogy in
Southaaat Aaia. that ie. the encirclanent of China.

What do you think of thia analyaie? And what relatione doae Vietna-
intend to have with Kalpuchaa?

Plum Van Dong: The Indochinaee Federation waa dead long before the defeat
of French colonialial in Indochina. no one epeake of it any more. Only
the Peking authoritiaa and certain other ilperialiat circlaa again evoke
thia untruth. which in iteelf reveals their own neocolonieliat anbitione
with regard to the people of Vietnal. Lace. and Kanpuchea.

During the part three decadea. the Iilitant aolidarity .ong the three
peoplea of Vietnam. Kaepuchee. ad Laoa hea been an important factor in
bringing about a victorioua revolution in each of the countriee againet
canon eneniaa. It in inperativa to atrengthen thia aolidarity. The
Soviet Union hea nothing to do with thia affair.

The aigning in Phnou Penh. thia peat 18 February. of the peace, friend-
ship. and cooperation treaty between the Socieliat Republic of Vietna-
and the People'e Republic of Kanpuchea inauguratea a new era in the tradi-
tional reletione of friendahip between the two peoplea. laying eolid

[Text] The conflict between the People‘s Republic of

China (vac) and the Socialist Republic of Vietnan (snv)
vhich began vith the Vietnanese invasion of Canbodia is
beginning to cast its shadow upon Japanese industry.

The ripple effect was felt aost keenly in our trade trane-
actions with the SRV. The steel industry abruptly can-
called a aid-February negotiating delegation visit to SRV,
the purpose of which was to discuss export of steel. Thoough
continuing cc-srcisl talks are proceeding snoothly. there
have been no new deals proposed since the beginning of the
year. and impatience in trade circles with the situation is
undeniable: "If this continues. we will have to switch to
other narkets." It appears that the reopening of the Viet-
nensse offshore oil dmlopnent negotiations has receded
into the uncertain future. 0n the other hand, the conflict
has brought unexpected positive ripple effects as to the
nonferrous natal industry where it took the for- of a sud-
den Jup in the price of copper ore. Though a great deal
depends on how the conflict will be resolved. it is an un-
deniable fact that the SRV market. once regarded as pronising
a potential aarket for Japanese industry as the reople's Re-
public of China. is for the tine being at least becoming less
attractive anidst an uncertain international political situa-
tion.

before the start of the PRC-SRV conflict. His major objective was to sake
arrangements for the first Japanese Merchandise Exhibit scheduled to be
held in ﬂanoi in Novssber and to talk over the technological exchange pro-
gram designed to inforn the export expansion-sinded 88V about nerchandise
quality control and standardization. A recent dispatch fro. Nakahars states
that, "the respective trade organs in Hanoi are conducting business as
usual and Japan-SRV trade steps are being executed without delay.” He
denies that the conflict has disrupted normal business operations. But

if the conflict is prolonged. it will certainly hasper Japan-SKV trade;

and there is a strong probability that it will continue for sole time.
The outlook is pessisistic.

A good portion of SRV export to Japan is in the forn of non Gay anthracite.
Last year. as a result of difficult price negotiations and reduced demand,
the export voluse sent down to 650,000 tone or half of the previous year's

for this year. But the coal producing regions are all close to the
Chinese border. It is feared that if the conflict is intensified and
there are Chinese air attacks. coal production would become impossible.
In such an event. it would certainly adversely affect Hitachi. Ltds con-
struction of a coal loading facility at Ben Gay Port. Moreover. there
are those who are beginning to voice concern regarding the effect of the
conflict upon transportation of seafood. spices and other products.

Industry Has Been on Guard for Some Time

The industry began to be cautious about its deadlines with SRV long be-
fore the outbreak of the current PRC-SRV conflict. It has been on guard
ever since the unprecedented great flood and the drought which plagued
Vietnam during the past 2 years. The natural disasters ruined the finan-
cial affairs of SRV anxious for speedy post-war recovery. As a result.
transactions with the SRV involved a "high risk country” problem and fi-
nancial institutions of various developed countries began to hesitate
about extending bank loans and other credit to the SRV. Furthermore, the
news of SRV invasion of Cambodia resulted in a temporary suspension of
Japanese government aid for the SRV scheduled for l979--lb billion yen
(loan in yen-10 billion yen; 4 billion yen in gratuitous aid).

Industry, which was counting on government loans, must necessarily hesi-
tate before going ahead with new plans. If the Japanese Government will
not intervene, than the Sky must seek supplier’s credit, bank loans and/or
other civilian based loans.

when he came to Japan toward the close of last year. SRV Foreign Minister
Nguyen Duy Trinh sought Japanese cooperation--both government and private
--for four projects: (1) power plant, (2) calcium carbide. (3) engine.
and (4) iron mill. But the predominant outlook in the trade circle is
that the commercial talks regarding such projects "are not likely to be
brought up by either side for some time to come."

Unexpected windfall for Nonferrous Industry

Based on a Long-term Iron and Steel Agreement (1978-1980). six major iron
and steel firms were scheduled to dispatch a negotiating delegation in
mid-February for talks regarding export of steel materials during the lat-
ter half of JP! 1918. But then, conflict between the PRC and the SRV be-
came increasingly severe and the steel companies hastily cancelled the
visit. With regard to future course of action Yuzuru Abe, Nippon Steel
Corporation vice president comments that. "All depends on the battle
situation. At present. there is no impediment to transactions with the
PRC; but dealings with the SRV must be postponed."

The six major steel companies signed a Long-term Iron and Steel Agreement
with the SRV in February 1978. This format of six major firms combining

to participate in commercial talks has been used before in dealing with

the PRC. Stable exports was the aim in adopting the same format for trans-
actions with the SRV. It would appear that the sudden turn of events dis-
rupted their plans for Vietnam. but volume-wise. coepared to over 5 million
tons per year going to China. the amount involved is small. It is small
even when compared to the 1.6 nillion tons going to Iran. Thus. the current
situation of no commercial talks with the SRV is not such a serious problem
for the steel industry. And. in terms of relationship with China, Nippon
Steel Corporation's participation in the cooperative construction effort of
Shsnghai Baoshen Steel Mill is proceeding without problems. The general

concensus is that there is nothing to worry about with respect to the
future.

The depressed fertilizer industry's situation is similar. After unifica-
tion of Vietnam. there was scanty export of fertiliser, using a friendship
company as a transactional base. Last Year. the Nippon Ammonium Sulfate
Industry Association became the first industry to start formal negotiations
with the SRV. But negotiations had come to a complete halt due to the fi-
nancial settlement question. The current conflict arose as negotiations
were about to be abandoned. There was an opinion in the industry that in
view of our relationship with China-the largest importer of fertiliser--
"export to the SRV ought to be approached very cautiously. For these
reasons, it is understandable that the fertilizer industry is undisturbed
by the news of the PRC-SKV conflict and claims to have suffered no ill ef-
fects from the conflict.

The conflict has caused a sudden jump in the metal goods prices and the non-
ferrous metal industry is enjoying an unexpected windfall. For example, the
copper ore price was rising before the outbreak of the PRC-SRV conflict as
it was being bought up as a strategic commodity, and this caused an impres-
sion of international shortage, but the conflict spurred the price hike.
however. there is a strong possibility that speculators are active in the
copper market. Moreover. the strategic nature of nonferrous metals. includ-
ing tungsten. will be reevaluated and this is expected to have repercussions.
These. than. are unknown factors underlying apprehensions.

Horrieoee Japan-China Petroleum Negotiation

Aside from the above. the Petroleum Public Cooperation is talking to the SRV
Government regarding the Mekong Delta offshore oil field development.

After the Japanese Government's criticism of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia,
the SRV hardened its attitude. and concerned parties are worried that, if the
SRV'e stance toward the Japanese Government becomes more rigid as o result of
the current PRC-SKV conflict. it is going to be much more difficult to resume
interrupted negotiations.

Though the prevailing View is that the conflict will not affect the trans-
actions with China, the sudden suspension of Japan-China petroleua negotia-
tiona created s stir among the participants.

The aorning of 17 February, the Chinese petroleum development negotiating
delegation that had been in Japan for a month holding talks with the
Petroleum Public Corporation returned home abruptly on e Shanghai bound
Japan Air Lines special flight. Late that night. tne world was abuzz with
the news of Chinese troops' penetration into Vietnaa.

The topic of this Japan-China negotiation was petroleum prospecting, devel-
opment and production in southern Bo Hui involving total costs of 600 bil-
lion yen. There was to be a signing of a meaorandun or a provisional con-
tract by the end of February. However. on 16 February, the Chinese
delegation unilaterally declared that they were returning to China. It is
no wonder that any conflicting explanations were circulated.

“tether or not the sudden flight home was due to the China-Vietnam conflict
is not certain. "hat makes the Japanese side uneasy ie the fact that there
is no schedule for resumption of negotiations and the uncertainty about the
future of China-Vietnam and China-USSR relations. There are those who fear
that if theee militarily tense relationships degenerate into a quagmire sit-
uetion. than "China will be forced to alter her economic buildup plans and
all the petroleum development projects including the one in southern Bo llei
would be affected."
