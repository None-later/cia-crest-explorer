Since the early 19703. a surveillance
program has identified those regions with
a significant incidence of endemic goitre
(thyroid enlargement). Worldwide, this
disorder is quite con-on among populations
who have iodine-deficient diets. who feed
on plants grown in iodine-depleted soil.
and who lack access to salt-water fish.

Goitre results from impaired manufacture of
thyroid hormones Aessential to fetal 'brain development and
general well-being Ahigh prevalence of goitre is associated with
cretinism (a form of conge'nital idiocy) and with weakness and
