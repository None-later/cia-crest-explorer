DANCERS CAUSED BY DRUG USE

Rangoon WORKING PEOPLE'S DAILY in English 29 Dec 78 p 273K
lEditorial: "An Unbeatable Combination"]

Text] The threat posed by narcotic drugs is being combated as a matter of
over-riding national importance. The magnitude of the danger is beyond
comparison in the depth of human degradation and despair which quickly
follows in the wake of the initial drug-induced euphoria. Opium was bad
enough on its own before the advent of modern drugs--not a few of which are
derived from opium itself but which are immensely more potent than the

original. The most well—known and doubtless the worst scourge is herein.
In spite of a host of other varieties of drugs, natural and synthetic heroin

still is the number one drug which has brought the greatest extent of
suffering and misery to mankind as a whole.

Among other well-known and common natural drugs is that of cannabis origin--
either "marihuana" which are the leaves and flowers of Indian hemp or
"hashish," the resin of the plant.

The main target in combating the drug menace has. of course, been the elimina-
tion of all known sources of cultivation of opium and Indian hemp. Timely
detection and eradication of such clandestine plantations constitute the most
essential aspect of the action taken since such measures hit directly at the
very source of drug production.

The amount of opium plantations destroyed during the 1976-1977 opium cultiva-
tion season totaled over 8,700 acres and in the following year, the amount
destroyed jumped to over 10,300 acres. This was carried out under Operation
Taung Htaik Pan [MountaintOp Flower] under the direction of the Central
Narcotics Control Board.

The measures were particularly successful in the Shan State and the Chin
State where onground detection was augmented by the use of aircraft which
were able to guide or transport search and destroy columns to clandestine

plantations or refineries and to intercept mule trains carrying narcotic
drugs.
in the Chin State the drastic fall in the cultivation of opium is shown by
the fact that only a mere 10 acres or so of plantations were found in
1977-l978. This is quite a cone-down from the 700-odd acres which were
found In 1976. Many areas of the Shan State where the bulk of the opium
In grown have also shown drastic falls in production. Some areas such as
Lauksawk. Ywa-ngun, Pindaya. Kalaw. Pin Laung and Nas Sang townships have
been reported to be totally free of opium cultivation.

Such results could only be achieved through concerted action. Plantations
are searched for and located during the cultivation season, from about
October or November to March making use of aircraft and intelligence supplied
by hard-core members working under the leadership of the party and super-
vision of the People's Councils. Although such opium fields are more often
than not deliberately sited in mountainous and almost inaccessible regions
the closely concerted efforts of the party. the Tatmadaw. the People's
Councils. the reople's Police and the local people have proved to bu an

unbeatable combination in literally rooting out narcotic drugs at their
sources .

’l‘llAl WOMAN GETS 81X YEARS FOR DRUG SHIGGLING
Bong Kong SOUTII_ClllNA MORNIm POST in English 20 Dec 78 p 16

[Text] A Thai woman who smuggled dangerous drugs into hongltong in order
to earn $1,500 to pay for a trip to china, was sentenced to six years'
imprisonment by a high Court judge yesterday.

Long Seetun (1.5) wanted to Join her brother in Swatow, as her husband had
died and she had no relatives in Thailand, her counsel, Mr John Bleach,
told Mr Justice Leonard.

Saetun pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing $51.3 grams of he lo heroin
for unlawful trafficking.

The drugs. which had a retail value of $187,200, were concealed in the
unusual high heels of Saetun'e shoes, which she was wearing when she
arrived from Bangkok by airon July 31.

Customs officers at the airport took her shoes, drilled a hole in one of
then and discovered the drugs.

Hr Bleach said in mitigation that Saetun was a Chinese national born in
mailmde

her husband was a farmer and they had an adopted son now aged 12.

As her husband died in July last year, she became the sole supporter of
herself and the child, and she wanted to join her brother in Swatow.

As the trip would account for alaost half her life savings, a friend of
her husband suggested that she snuggle contraband into liongkong where
someone would approach her at the airport and give her $1.500.

She was also proaised a bicycle for her adopted son and assured that
there was no possibility she would be caught.

16
she know she was carrying cnntrabnnd, bu: did not know it was heroin.

Counsel said the trapcstion was :00 great. she was just a one-timer
courier and not n professional one.

Mr Bleach was instructed by the Director of Legal Aid.

Crown counsel Daniel nsrash prosecuted.

KAI TAK NEROIN SEIZURE--Alert customs officers at Kai Tak Airport yester-
day seized five pounds No 3 heroin concealed in the sides of two cardboard
boxes containing preserved seafood and other groceries. The refined heroin
was packed in half-ounce bags, each of which would have fetched about
$250,000 on the black market. A senior customs officer said a 38-year-old
man who flew here from Bangkok on board an international flight had been
arrested in connection with the seizure. He was expected to appear in

San Po Kong Court tomorrow. The heroin, which was believed to be more than
50 percent pure, has been taken to the Government Chemist for examination.
Sources said last night that it is rare to find refined No 3 heroin being
smuggled into Hongkong. They added that it could have been ”cut" with
other substances before being sold to addicts. Host heroin sold in Nong-
kong r as free between 20 and 23 percent in purity, the sources said.

UNDERWATER DRUG NOARD SEIZED-~Narcotics Bureau detectives yesterday
uncovered an underwater opium storage centre in Aberdeen. A senior
officer of the bureau said last night this was the first time he had
come across an underwater storage facility being used for prepared opium,
although raw opium had been frequently found on the seabed. Following
the seizure of the five pounds of prepared opium-~worth about $50,000--
from a rope attached to an abandoned junk off Aplichau, Royal Navy divers
searched the area. Detectives said the opium may have been stored there
for some time as the drugs appeared to be old imports. Detectives received
information about the underwater storage centre a few days ago. They
boarded a junk 100 yards off Aplichsu about 1 pm yesterday and pulled up
a rope, where detectives found a tin weighted with rocks containing three

packets of prepared opiuu. [Text] [hang Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST

DRUG-RELATED CRINEs--The drug-related crime rate showed a marked decline
last year seemingly thanks to strengthened control. According to the
Seoul District Prosecution, 579 persons were prosecuted for involvement
in crimes related to hemp and other illegal drugs, compared with 786 in
1977 and 1.662 in 1976. The prosecution said of the booked persons. 297
were related to hemp-smoking with those in their 20’s making up around
55 percent. Students below the age of 20 accounted for about 8.6 percent
of those booked for hemp-smoking. The prosecution said the statistics

It also said in the past hemp was smoked in groups. But now there was a
growing tendency to take to hemp individually. the prosecution said.

[Text] nofin, 3 Jan. ETA-min 1978 the customs authorities have uncovered 85 cases or
cauggling with nearly 3.300 kilograms of drugs. Compared to the previous two years this
quantity is reduced. In 1976 it was 5,120 kg, and in 1977 l5881 kg. The Bulgarian
cuctons authorities are of the vieu that due to the utrsngthenod control the snugglers take
still fewer risks to cross the Bulgarian frontiers.

The cases of heroin snuggling have become quite frequent of late. It is obvious that the
labs for its obtaining are being moved nearer to the production centers, nearer the raw
material sources. Under the circumstances the customs cffioers' vigilance continues to
be alert although the drug addiction problem does not exist in Bulgaria.

New more than ever. combating drug addiction. especially drug snuggling. requires the
united international efforts. This was the purpose of the first international customs
conference for cooperation in combating drug smuggling. which was held last September

in Verna. Organized by the customs administrative: of Bulgaria and the USA, it was
attended by representatives of 2b countries. the W0 and the customs Cooperation Council.
Bulgaria is expected to host again a customs expert meeting in the autumn of 1979.

The experts will review the practical results of the conference and will give recommende-
ticn: on future actions against the illegal traffic.

OPERATION UNCOVERING INTERNATIONAL COCAINB RING DETAILED
Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 16 Dec 78 p 16

[Text] The Ministrv of Justice has determined that two cocaine traffickers
of the so-called "international Mafia connection," arrested in the course of
"operation extermination," which gave the additional benefit of l7 kilograms
of cocaine seized, are being held incoamunicado until they have been ques-
tioned by the U. 6. police who are investigating the massacre and collective
suicide ir Pastor Jim Jones' People's Temple.

Those men were connected with supplying the followers of Jim Jones“ sect.
They had maintained that relationship (and eventually drug smuggling) since
the time when Jones lived in Belo horizonte, before settling in Guyana. One
of them -- arrested by the agents of the U. 8. Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion, who also took part in the Operation -- had passed through the hands of
the Guyanese police, which permitted discovery of the network's international
connections.

Successful Beginning

The inquiries leading to the dismantling of that international gang began
with the arrest of Afrenio Celso Pereira Martins and wanderiey Campelo, who
had smuggled from Bolivia part of the cocaine hidden inside an accordeon.
The pair were living in the Hotel Paris in Sao Paulo, and in their possession
the agents of the Armed Tactical Pursuit Group found a little black notebook
containing a series of addresses. The Armed Tactical Pursuit Group is an

operational group under the Sao Paulo office of the DP? [Federal Police De-
partment]. it is under the command of District Federal Police Chief Arthur
Catbone Pilho. '

investigations centered on the names written in that little notebook. which
were a list of consumers serviced by the traffickers, made possible the iden-
tiiicution of a group of cocaine smugglers who were operating with the "water-
tight compartment" technique. At the moment when chief Carbone Pilho was
giving information on that series of arrests to the press, Federal Judge Cid
Flacquer-Scartezini was sentencing Afranio Celso Pereira Martins and

46
wandurley Cnmpelo each to six years of imprisonment for the trafficking that
led to the beginning of the investigation.

Because of the facts discovered in San Paulo, the investigation carried out
in Belo Horizonte (at the request of the U. 8. Government, as the People's
Temple case was involved) and the trails uncovered in Camps Grande, Corumba
and Bolivia, a meeting was held in Brasilia. Col hoacir Coelho, director
general of the DPP, Pablo Wanderley Calheiros, director of the Drug Division,
Alceu Andrade Rocha, coordinator of the Police Center and Carbone Pilho,
chief of the Sao Paulo District of the Federal Police. took part.

”Operation extermination” was thought up at that meeting and given top prior-
ity. en axis of action was established between the regional headquarters of
Sao Paula and Hato Grosao, the latter under the eoemnnd of Regional Chief
Antonio Santana. The operation had two additional sources of support: the
agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who furnished information as
it came to their attention, and the Federal DOPS [Department of Political

and Social Order] in the two states, under the coordination of chiefs
hauricio Nunes and Frederico Paulo Astolfo respectively.

The inVestigations eVen delved into the activities of many consumers of the
drugs supplied by the gang. They were members of high See Paulo and Mato
Grosso society. when the investigation had been completed, the traffickers
were identified and their steps were followed without interruption.

Many agents infiltrated Bolivia disguised as tourists. As the traffickers
entered brazil they were being arrested and held in close confinement. The
first to be found was Adao Dias de Oliveira, who was in Corumba. The agents
seized 1,750 grams in his possession. The others were arrested as the .a-
vestigation went forward: the Boliviana Maria Sanchez de Sueldo and Jose
Rojas Torrico were arrested in Campo Grande with 2,930 grams of "fish-scale“
cocaine. The arrest of the Bolivian national Helvy Gonzalez Max brought
2,760 grams more. Roque Justiniano Gallego, a Bolivian, was smuggling 6,110
grams reported to be for the group associated with Portuguese millionaire
Antonio Augusto Nunez. Artur de Jesus Cunha Rocha, a Portuguese, finally
told who the leader of his group was.

The remaining gang members were shortly being captured. At most, they knew
each other by sight, as their modus operandi was that of "watertight compart-

meats," and this prevented easy recognition of one gang member by another.
with Elias El Daher, Uilson Said Boutros and Dinarte Vicente de Almeida Pilho

seized 1,500 grams, for a total of 17 kilos out of a shipment of 25 kilos ac-
quired in Bolivia, with a gross value of 60 million cruzeiros.

New Route
It was the U. 5. agents who supplied the report on the Portuguese national

Antonio Augusto Nunes, who up to that time had been operating in the direc-
tion of centralizing his operation in France. Once he had been detected by

05
the ”HA they dlucnvered lhii he had been operating in
Paris-United States axis since 1963. This time he changed his route, as-

tablishing a Bolivia-Bresil-Portugsl axis. distributing the drug from Por-
tugal.

One-of the accused declared that he was to have aet a Portuguese national in
Bolivia. when the facts were put together, agents disguised as tourists lo-
cated Antonio hunts and followed him. They discovered that the plan had been

frustrated. Nunes boarded a VASP [Sao Paulo Air Line] airplane to return to
his own country.

Contact was established with the captain of the airplane and it landed at
Congolhas -- Sao Paulo -- and parked with its doors closed until the federal
agents could arrive fro. sao Paulo and place the leader and financier of that

group under arrest. As this was going on the police in Caapo Grands remained
on the alert until Antonio Nunes' arrival.

In the secondary case of the People's Teaplc, two of the three persons con-
nected with Jim Jones' sect who had the task of supplying the users who be-

longed to that group of religious fanatics have died. The third is being
nought by agents of the DEA.

This fact brought about the opening of an inquiry by U. S. authorities. The
DBA’s informers aade it clear to the federal agents in See Paulo that two of
the suspects were connected with the Belo horizonte investigations. One of

them had been in the hands of the Guyanese Police. a fact confirmed by In-
terpol.

The federal agents established. in Caleao. that even though the group in-
tended to remain three days in Rio de Janeiro. not one of then had a tourist
visa for Brazil. The police told the group that their stay in Rio de Janeiro
would depend on the authorisation of the United States Consulate and that
should a stay be allowed. a fine would have to be paid for having entered
the country without a proper visa. Meanwhile. the Sea. Air. and Order
Police Office contacted the United States Consulate in Rio de Janeiro and.
unable to reach the consul. decided to wait for the steps taken by the
consulate. while the group would be kept at police office. while waiting
for the consulate's answer. the police undertook a search of the group's
luggage. eight suitcases having been inspected. At that point the agents
noticed the group's nervousness. According to the police. Roberto Ramirez
and Cruz. Junior. were seen talking to each other in a corner of the rooa.
after which they made an offer to the police: They would pay double the
neount of the fine stipulated for the absence of a visa providing that

their baggages were not searched. The Federal Police rejected the bribe

and opened the luggage of the five passengers and the two neebera of the
crew.

"Made in Brazil"

The 17.7 kilograee of cocaine were found in a gray-colored suitcase. It
was located in 18 bags of laminated paper wrapped in clear plastic. The
suitcase also contained a role of laminated paper and a large piece of
folded plastic fabric to be used for repackaging the drug after a sale.
The seven Americans denied ownership of the suitcase with the cocaine.
claiming ignorance as to how it had entered the plane. It is the belief
of the Federal Police that out of the 17.7 kilograms. assessed at 70 mil-
llon cruaeiroa, 2 kilograms would have been sold in Rio de Janeiro for

2 million cruzeiros. The two kilograms of cocaine were contained in a
bag labeled "Made in Brazil." which would have indicated the destination
of the drug. Rio de Janeiro was the only Brazilian city on the group's
itinerary.

International Itinerary

taught in the act. the five passengers and two crew meabers were taken to
the drug control office where they were interrogated and where they faced
the press last night. The passengers claimed to have leased the Lear Jet

in Los Angeles for a pleasure trip. The airplane. property of the Executive
Aviation Service. located at 3521 East Spring Street. Long Beach. California.
90806. had been leased for $650 per flight hour. The chief pilot Daniel H.
Glover stated that by the time the plane had reached Galeao it had already
been in the air for 13 1/2 hours. The total trip was to last 30 hours.
representing a cost of $9.500--cloae to 400.000 cruseiros-for the haulage
of the cocaine. This figure did not include the cost of the plane's deten-
tion in Rio de Janeiro by the federal Police. Its release will be deter-
mined by the Federal Judiciary.

The police were impressed by the purity of the seized cocaine. Once mixed.
considering its high quality. the drug could have been quadrupled in volume
before reaching the market. The group left Los Angeles on the 26th (Monday).
The following day it touched down in La Pa: and Acapulco. Mexico. and
Guaiequil. Equador. for refueling. The Lear Jet left Guaiaquil on the 27th.
for Santa Cruz de La Sierra. a Bolivian city internationally acknowledged

as a launching point for the international cocaine traffic. After spending
the night in Santa Cruz de La Sierra. the airplane took off for Rio de
ianeiro. The group was to remain here three days and return to Los Angeles.

According to the Federal Police the detention of the seven Americans identi-
fled. one more time. Rio de Janeiro as on important stop in the route of

the international cocaine traffic. Purchased in Bolivia. the cocaine has
been reaching the United States via the east coast since the beginning of
the 1970's. when the 0.5. authorities undertook to police more tightly the
west coast of the country. to block the smuggling of the drugs fro. South
American countries. As the itinerary was changed. Brazilian cities such as
Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. essentially. became important stops in the
drug traffic.

Yesterday. the Rio Drug Control Office discovered at kilometer 18 of the
Rio-Friburgo highway. in the Cachoeira de Macacu municipality. a cocaine
distillery owned by the Sao Paulo trafficker Berthier Bscelar. arrested on
Thursday in Leblon. The investigation launched by the state conflicts with
that of the Federal Police, following the discovery of 17.7 kilograms of
cocaine in an airplane.

The detention of Berthier Bscelar occurred almost accidentally. According
to the drug control office agents. he had bought a Maverick in Sao Paulo
and paid for it with a bad check. As he was already facing several charges
in Sao Paulo. two officials and an investigator from Degran decided to go
to Rio to collect information on Bacelar from the office of the Banco

Itau. Ataulfo dc Paiva Avenue. from which the check cashed in Sao Paulo

peraon. Later on. interrogated at Office No 14. he ia acid to have con-
feaaed to aelling 17 kilograms of cocaine brought in froa Sao Paulo to aome

in Berthiar'e Maverick the police found a receipt for the purchaae of build-

ARREST OP ARGENTINE RBVBALS COCAINE ROUTE TO CANADA
Sao Paulo FOLNA DE 8A0 PAULO in Portuguese 13 Dec 78 p 16

[Text] Three kilos of pure cocaine -- worth $150,000 -- were to be "ex-
ported"fron Sno Paulo to Canada, the country considered to be the newest
market for the international traffickers. The police discovered the traffic
and caught the Argentine Rafael Alberto Aguilar (a naturalised Canadian) in
flagrante and are investigating the case, which involves several Brazilians.
Aguilar is 33 years old and resides in Quebec, Canada.

This information was divulged yesterday by Commissioner Carlos Ferreirs
Castro, director of the Drug Division of the 0310 [Criminal Investigations
Department] and by Commissioner Sergio Paranhss Pleury, who volunteered this
detail: "Rafael is an important link in an international gang of traffickers.
Ne are on the verge of discovering a second gang, perhaps even bigger than
this one."

In the presence of the entire police team that has dealt with the case,
Rafael Alberto Aguilar was presented to the press at 1700 hours. he kept his
head down and did not utter a word. Ne is pale and wears his hair in an
"American cut," has a mustache, is about 1.65 meters tall. He showed no emo-
tion in the presence of the photographers.

Information was divulged on the affair only by the two delegates. They dis-
played the merchandise just as it was seized on b December in the "Pareoval
Sawmill, Ltd.," at Nenrique Ongari street No. 290, in Agua Branca.

In the office of Commissioner Carlos Perreira Castro, a few hardwood planks
rested on four chairs. In the middle of them there were two "PCV" tubes one

inch in diameter with threaded caps on each end. These served as contain-
ers for the conditioning of the cocaine.

Many Suspects
The owners of the sawmill had to explain the affair to the police, but every-

thing is still being investigated, including the involvement of three other
sawmills that shared in camouflaging the product. There have also been

51
investigations which have aroused suspicions concerning some gangland per-
sonalities in the state capital.

The investigations are reaching out into other states (whose names have not
been revealed by the authorities) and into other countries, such as Argen-
tina. Bolivia and naturally Canada, since that country is the final destina-
tion of the poison which was to be dispatched tomorrow in three legs on a
freighter leaving the port of Santos.

Members of police forces of other countries (whose names have not been di-
vulged either) are due to arrive in Sao Paulo by next Saturday in order to
collaborate in the investigations, which will reach as far as the United
States. Concerning that collaboration Cannissioner Fleury declared that
"it is a set of aoves with one sole objective: to do away with the
drug traffic."

New Route

Pleury explained that the cocaine was bought by Aguilar in Bolivia, were pre-
cisely in Santa Cruz de la Sierra. In the producing zone it cost 8,000 cru-
reiros a kilo. With reference to the price at which it would be sold in
Canada, he was unable to reply, explaining that "I can state that in the
United States those three kilos would easily be sold for $l50,000."

The Argentine came by bus from Bolivia to the City of Sao Paulo by bus, pass-
ing through Corunbe and Coupe Crande. On the subject of using the bus, the
DBIC director explained that "this man is a professional. If he had come by
air. he would be guilty of violating the Law of National Security and the
risk would be greater too."

According to what the Sao Paulo authorities were able to discover, Aguilar
was able to send cocaine to Canada three times and was not caught until he
changed his route and traveled by way of Sao Paulo. The other times he had
not come through Brazil.

"in spite of that," Commissioner Carlos Perreire observed, "we have not
ceased to worry about the international traffic. Re are always seeking to
determine whether Sao Paulo really is turning into a new route for that kind
of commerce. We are being quite successful."

Pleury did not deny the possibility that Sao Paulo or other cities in the
state have been a staging area for shipping drugs to other countries. He
declared that he is "certain that in a short time we shall close the doors
of all Brazil on the trade in narcotics."

POLICE ASSIST IN REHABILITATION EFFORT OF 300 ADDICTED YOUTRS
Rio do Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 18 Dec 78 p 16

[Text] A group of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and one judge
who works in his free time have cured 300 young people of their dependency on
drugs this year. Seventy-nine others are still undergoing treatment in a
pioneering initiative by Brazilian police.

Just to give an idea of the kind of problem faced by the group, there are
cases like that of the father who, when he cautioned his 17-year-old son on
the risks he was running by getting mixed up with drugs, heard the boy reply:
"You are behind the times. If you had been born now, you'd be into then
too." The boy is one of the 79 addicts that the group of volunteers is try-
ing to cure.

An Old Idea

The creation of a social service with the objective of curing drug addicts
is quite old, according to Connissioner Jose Roberto Vieira. It dates free
1972, and it began in the now defunct Departeent of Gusto-s and Diversions
of the former State of Rio de Janeiro. "In the Isantina," he observed. "in
spite of the efforts of Commissioner Rogerio Mont Karp, for reasons that had
nothing to do with our willingness, the idea was never put into action."

At the beginning of last year, in the big old house on the corner of Saldanha
Harinho and Visconde de Sepetiba streets, in Niteroi, Commissioner Jose
Roberto and Judge Paulo Cesar Panza resolved to go forward with the idea.
They had been promoting discussions on the danger of narcotics in clubs,
schools and barracks. They sought out psychiatrists Osmar Santos and Juber
da Silveira Goncnlves and psychologist Reinaldo de Oliveira. They also re-
cruited social workers Harilene Araujo Hachado and Mrs Maria Amelia Costa.

That group, which works in hospitals and psychiatric clinics in Niteroi, al-
ternates daily in caring for the patients. They do not limit their atten-
tions L0 persons held in the Narcotics Division but care as well for others
who go there every afternoon seeking help. According to Co-nissioner Jose
Roberto, they are from l8 to 27 years old, most of then are male, and

53
addicts who have never been in police custody predominate. However, many of
these have learned of the social service through former inmates.

Cure Complicated

For Judge Paulo Cesar Panza, of the First Criminal Bench of Sao Concslo, the
curing of drug addicts is not just a matter of getting them off drugs. It is
also a question of reintegrating them into society, since many of them are
unemployed and have no professional skills. "Since the best therapy for an
addict is to have an occupation," the judge remarked, "my task is to look for
work for thean and i go around to service clubs like the Lions and Rotary."

after emphasising that there is no predominance of one social class or an-
other -- "persons of all kinds seek us out" -- Judge Paulo Cesar Pants ob-
served that the primordial function of the law in relation to the addict is
not punishment but recovery and "thus the Niteroi Narcotics Division is car-
rying out the commands of the law." In spite of the treatment's being done
in a police station, the demand is great and the addict is ianndiately told
that he has nothing to be afraid of and that "he will have a friendly hand to
help him," the judge added.

The recovery process, according to Commissioner Jose Roberto and psychiatrist
Juhar ds Silveira Concalves, an INAHPS [expansion unknown] physician, consists
of psychiatry, which may be either individual or group. There is always a
physician, a psychologist and a social worker on duty who guide and listen to
the addict. As social worker Herilene Araujo Hachado explained it, they al-
ways seek "to emphasise his good side." In addition to that, the social
service seeks out the members of the addicts' families with the additional
objective of orienting them on the best way of helping in the treatment.

Causes of Addiction

Although the group making up the social service of the Niteroi Drug Division
is not worried about what may have turned the young person to drug addiction,
"but rather to show him a way out," doctors as well as psychologists and so-
cial workers, in addition to Commissioner Jose Roberto believe that the nar-
cotic "is not a cause: it is an effect." According to the police officer,
who is also a sociologist, addiction is a result of social, family and psy-
cological reasons, all of them acting negatively on the addict.

"Modern life," observed Commissioner Jose Roberto, "is growing more and more
difficult. The fight for survival leads parents to forget about their child-
ren, who go into the streets to find the answers to their questions. That is
when the young person begins to run the risk of using narcotics, simply be-
cause we never have time to talk with him. That struggle to survive is mak-
ing the parents return home very late and leave very early, weakening the
family structure. And it is for that reason that we think it is time to see
in what direction we are heading -- youth, police, society."

56
The opinion of psychiatrist Juher da Silveiro conceives in not very differ-
ent from that of the police omissioner as far as the family problem ie
concerned an a probable cause of drug addiction. "Children," he oheerved,
"do not take kindly to heing mine by Mop-others or etepfathere. And
when that aeena inevltnhle the young poreon who has already gone through the
turmoil of a ualadjuated marriage winds up as an addict. Ilia recovery may
take a week or a month. or it any never take place."

APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: ClA-RDP82—00850R000100010082-1
[Bccerpt] The drastic law that represses drug traffic, coffee slug-
gling and the illegal arns trade was declared constitutional last
night by the Supreme Court of Justice.

Nevertheless, some provisions were struck down for being iuprecise
and lending themselves to possible arbitrariness. These include a
norm that was interpreted as an "escape law" for those who disobeyed
the orders of the nilitary forces and the National Police.

Decree 2144 was dictated by the present administration last 4 October
based on the prerogatives of Article 121 of the Constitution on dis-
turbance of public order and state of siege throughout national ter-
ritory. The norms are being applied with special strictness in La
Guajira where restrictions on the use of national air space and on
drug traffic have been established.

In accord with the Constitution. this decree was reviewed by the Su-
prene Court so that it could rule on its constitutionality. Luis
Sarniento mitrago, the president of the court, was in charge of
this. After several modifications and criticisms, last night he is-
sued a decision that the statute is constitutional accept for at-
press parts which were declared unacceptable.

One of these is the part of Article 3 which states: "violators will
be subject to the action of these forces (military and national po-
lice) when they resist or carry out actions that indicate their in-
tention to flee after being ordered to remain in a specific site, to
land or take a certain route." The court felt that this provision
was too imprecise and could justify fatal excesses.

One provision in Article 6 states: "In case by confirming decision
of the appropriate authority the resolution of the governor, intendant

58
or comissary is revoked and. consequently, the good confiscated must
be returned, this will be returned in its present state after the in-
terested party pay. the expenses of maintenance, storage and security."
The court rejected this provision for clear constitutional violations
since it is not fair that a person who is declared innocent has to

pay the expense. of naintenance, storage and security for his own
asset which was returned to his danced or obsolete.

Other details were also declared unconstitutional but they could not

be explained since it was so late when the criminal division or the
court closed.

Nevertheless, it is known that in the active part or the decision,
the court was very explicit that the provisions in the statute apply

eaeclusively to drugs, coffee smogling and illegal arms trade and do
not extend to other fields.

Also the most modern and sophisticated high-frequency radio equipment
has been seized from the drug traffickers, according to official
reports.

Sources of the Second Brigade based in Barranquilla told the televi-
sion news program "Cine Vision" that the results of 40 days of opera-
tions in that region of the country have been satisfactory.

The sources indicate that during the time in which the drastic se-
curity measures have been in effect, 59 revolvers and 37 pistols of
different calibers, two 6-3 rifles used exclusively by the military
forces and two Punto Treinta rifles have been confiscated.

In spite of the secrecy of the authorities on this case, it was
learned that Ramiro Gomez Giraldo was in an establishment in the
western sector of this city called "Grill 81 zmrape" when he was at-
tacked by a person who shot him five times and killed him.

According to some versions, the person who fired the shots was a

also stated that two people riddled him with bullets and fled.

It was strongly rumored that both murders were related; an intensive

It was indicated that Alfredo Gomez, the 'Oodtather," has lived in

Palmitas for which he was tried.

Authorities in this department expressed serious tear concerning the

site where marihuana was being exported, apparently using an airplane
on a clandestine landing strip in the area, was discovered. When the
troops learned about the activities of the drug traffickers, they
tried to arrest them. The gangsters fell back and, using modern
weapons, took part in a spectacular confrontation with the military
troops. The troops strategically repelled the attack against them
and wounded some drug smugglers who were removed in the midst of the

[Text] Mexico City. 6 Decenber--After a difficult investigation, the Federal
Judicial Police, during the past 16 hours, arrested eight drug traffickers

who were operating in various parts of the country. from whom they succeeded
in seizing 9,000 kilograms of narihuana valued at several thousands of pesos.

In asking the foregoing announcement. the Office of the Attorney General of
the Republic noted that the arrests took place in Nuevo Leon, Oaxaca, Chi-
huahua, Guadalajara, Coahuila and Sonora, where those arrested were placed
at the disposal of the Federal Public Ministries.

In each case, an investigation is being conducted to discover their contacts,
both in the country and abroad, since some of them were acting as distribu-
tors and middlemen.

During this operation, the Federal Judicial Police arrested Guadalupe Bel-
tran Molina and Miguel Angel Comer Molina, in the town of Cerralvo, Nuevo
Leon, and confiscated a ton of marihuana from them.

Their accomplices, Ismael Zavala Gone: and Roberto Gonzalez Velez, were also
apprehended. and stated that they had a storage place for such grass for
several years in that town.

The same thing was done in Oaxaca, where the drug trafficker and marihuana
distributor and middleman. Antonio Hernandez Perez, was arrested. Me was
purchasing the drugs in Palomares, to ship and sell them in the northern
part of the country.

At the Cieneguitas farm, which belongs to the municipality of Valle de Juar-
ez, Jalisco, police agents arrested Silvestre Sanabria Mojca and Rodriguez
Loza Orozco with a ton and 212 kilograms of packed marihuana, 10 kilograms
of seed and two scales. The public ministry opened the preliminary investi-
gation.

Likewise. in the border town of Nogales. Sonora, federal agents discovered
59 kilograms of packed marihuana abandoned. near the United States border;
and therefore the authorities have initiated an investigation.

Charges Denied, Coercion Claimed
Nnevo Laredo EL MANANA in Spanish 15 Wet 78 Sec 3 p 2

[Text] The 10 members of a well organized ring of presumed marihuana and
heroin traffickers appeared before the third district judge yesterday to
make their preliminary statement. They all cynically denied being guilty
of the charges which the Federal Public Ministry has brought against them,
and at the same time they claimed to have been tortured by their captors.

Those making statements were Moracio Garcia Gonzalez, Enrique Gonzalez Quin-
tnnilla. Guadalupe Beltran Molina, Roberto Gonzalez Veliz, Jaime Villarreal

Treyino, Ernesto Medina Lopez, Doroteo Oliveira Villarreal, Ramiro Estrada
Salinas, Ismael Zavala Games and Ramon Acosta Bernal.

One by one they were seated on the defendants' bench during the course of the
investigation, and all agreed in their statement that they had never been an-
gaged in drug trafficking. Some of them argued that they did not know one
-another.

Cynically, based on the recommendations of their defenders, they stated that
the federal agents had beaten them and "forced them to confess things that
they did not do."

It may be recalled that, on 3 December, the Federal Judicial Police captured
Miguel Angel Gomez Diaz and Guadalupe Beltran Molina, who claimed to be an
inspector from the Federal Registry of Motor Vehicles.

Beltran Molina said that he was engaged in drug trafficking, simultaneously
noting that he had a shipment of 56 burlap bags of marihuans weighing 1,000

trict court for marihuana trafficking, charged with a crime against health

Guadalupe Beltran Molina, Ismael Zavala Gamez,Migue1 Angel Gonzalez Diaz,
Roberto Gonzalez Veliz, Horacio Gonzalez, Ramiro Estrada Salinas, Ernesto
Medina Lopez, Ramon Acosta Bernal and Ernesto Gonzalez, for the crime of

already been released, namely, Benjamin Garcia Martinez and Jorge Beltran Her-
cado, referring us to files 352/77 and 3540, order 686/78, respectively.

Mr Caaildo Chavez Uriarte, who has been confined in the Sinaloa Social Reha-
bilitation Institute (IRSS) for about a year, is having his case investigated,

[Text] The activities carried out by the Federal Judicial Police, with the
unlimited support of National Army forces.during the interval from 1 Decem-
ber 1977 to 30 November 1978 resulted in the destruction of 15,635 poppy
plants, 2,535 marihuana plants and 103 mixed plantations.

The areas on which those plantations were located totaled 1,316, 157 and nine
hectares, respectively; and the work was done through the use of the spraying
system over the entire state and on the borders of Chihuahua and Durasgo.

This information was provided by the official spokesman for the coordinator

of the antidrug trafficking campaign in zone 06, and indicated that seizures
were made of 150,508 kilograms and 382 grams of marihuana. 627 kilograms and
106 grams of seed of the same grass, 66 kilograms and 977 grams of poppy seeds,
94 kilograms and 17 grams of opium gum, 59 kilograms and 826 grams of heroin
and 65 kilograms and 750 grams of heroin cutting substance.

A total of 3 kilograms and 796 grams of cocaine were confiscated, as were 3
kilograms and 810 grams of cocaine cutting substance, 190 grams of hallucino-
genic mushrooms, 3 kilograms and 800 grams of peyote, 8 liters of diluted
opium and £73,516 toxic pills.

Twenty-one laboratories were located and destroyed, and the implements used
in them were seized. Arrests were made of 980 persons, of whom 19 were of
foreign nationality , and 312 firearms were confiscated (187 short-barreled
and 125 long-barreled), in addition to 8,000 cartridges.

A total of 118 vehicles were seized as evidence of the crimes in question,
as well as seven aircraft and a boat, all of which were used to carry drugs
inside of the state.

In the opinion of the federal authorities, the campaign per as was satisfac-
tory, but this does not mean that there will be any letdown in all the neces-
sary vigilance; because an effort is being made to keep the production,
planting. manufacturing, distribution and trafficking of drugs and narcotics
in the zone in which the state is located to a minimum.

RANCHER SENTENCED FOR GROHING MARIHUANA
Piedras Negros EL DIARIO DB PIEDRAS NBCRAS in Spanish 14 Dec 78 p 1

[Text] Sebastian Soto Burks, the millionaire rancher from Hslchor Huaquiz,
Coahuila, who was captured by forces of the Federal Judicial Police for en-
gaging in the growing of nsrihuana was sentenced yesterday by the federal
judge of the second district court in this town, Eduardo Aguilar. upon the
conclusion of the trial to which he was brought for a crime against health
in the degree of planting and cultivation of cannabis indica.

Federal Judge Aguilar gave Sebastian Soto Burks a prison sentence of 6 years
and a fine of 6.000 pesos; and he is not entitled to a suspended sentence.

As may be recalled, Sebastian Soto Burks was arrested by the Federal Judicial
Police and, without putting up any resistance, was taken by his captors to
the "Soga" ranch in this municipality of Huzquiz, where they found 263 mari-
husna bushes.

This occurred on 19 June 1978. He made a full confession, stating that the
merihuana which he planted and cultivated was for his personal consumption.
The federal court was of the opinion that, since this was his first offense
and he had no record (understandably), in addition to the fact that he had

not resisted capture. he should receive that sentence. The penalty establish-
ed in Article 195 is from 2 to 9 years' imprisonsent. ~

It may also be recalled that there was a very striking occurrence in this
affair, a tragic one; because the convicted man‘s wife died after visiting
him in the preventive Jail, while returning to her residence in Helehor. Muz-

quiz.

Unofficial sources stated that Sebastian Soto himself caused the situation
and the lack of defense, by refusing to notify his relatives, and making
then think that he was free, traveling in the interior of the country.

[Text] Mexico City, 30 December-The states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon and Co-
ahuila are the ones in which the heaviest drug trafficking has been occurring
recently, since the areas of Sonora, Sinaloa and Baja California have come
under extremely close surveillance by the Federal Judicial Police.

Upon noting that the drug traffic increased in the ao-called "Zone 11" since
October, the chief of that police force, aided by army troops, ordered an
intensification of the surveillance; and positive results were accrued, such
as the confiscation of 14 tons of narihusna and the arrest of 250 drug traf-
ficera.

In addition, an XB-HUH Piper plane of United States origin was captured, and
seizures were made of a quarter of a kilogram of cocaine, 10 kilograms of no-
vocaine, 36 kilograms of heroin, 20 LSD pills, 72 high-powered weapons and

26 cars with Texas and California license plates, all with an approximate
value of 90 million pesos.

In the towns of Nuevo Laredo, Tanaulipas; Culiacan, Sinaloa; Palomares, Oaxa-
ca; Mexicali, Baja California; Tapachula, Chiapas; Los Mochis, Sinaloa; Agua
Priets, Sonora; Navojos, Sonora, and other adjoining districts, the afore-
mentioned number of drug traffickers were arrested. They were carrying to
Zone 11 a variety of drugs, such as marihuana, cocaine, novocaine, peyote,
psychotropic pills and heroin, because of their inability to operate in other
areas which are being guarded by forces from the police and the army detailed
to those locations.

[Text] Mexico City. 12 Deceaber--The Federal Judicial Police intercepted 69
million peaos' worth of pure cocaine which was being carried in a two-engine
turboprop Cessna 310 plane. at the international airport in Tapachula. Chia-
pas. where the plane crew was likewise arrested.

This confiscation brings the total drugs to be sold in the United States and
intercepted here during the past 26 hours to over 769 million pesos' worth.

The cocaine was in containers which usually hold beauty products, and was
stored in the plane's battery.

Federal Judicial Police agents arrested Taylor and Karen Luisi Trout, after
they had noticed the plane making frequent trips without parlission from the
aeronautics authorities.

Upon being questioned, the plane's crew revealed that it purchased the cocaine
in Guatemala so as to sell it later in the United States.

With this new seizure. the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic has
become the Mexican department that has caused the international drug traffic
the greatest devastation.

Those who questioned the drug traffickers have provided the other police forces
in different countries with important information leading to the capture and
disbanding of rings that are operating in the United States, Canada, Guatemala,
Colombia and El Salvador.

m,r example, with the arrest yesterday of Gustavo Gonzalez Sanchez. Pedro Joa-
quin Guzman Colin and the brothers Alejandro and Jesus Hora Rolon. there was

a disclosure of the leading cocaine supplier in Guatemala, as well as of the
place where vehicles were being outfitted with secret cospartnents for ship-

municipality of Morelos. Chihuahua. complained here of countless incidents
involving harassment. torture and arbitrary action on the part of forces from

the Mexican Army assigned to tasks relating to "Operation Condor." to combat
the drug traffic in the Chihuahua mountains.

Manuel Hernandez Osorio. spokesman for the accusers. said that the troops have
spread terror in the area. and that it is a misfortune to live in Horelos. to
fall into the hands of the military and to be poor.

Hernandez Osorio came to this capital to report the incidents and said that
he represented the Supreme Council ofTarnhumara in Horalos, the local Cattle-
men's Union and the associations of union members. communal farmers and min-

ers' unions of the area. which is located in the heart of the Tarahumara
mountains.

The informer stressed the fact that. using the excuse that they are conduct-
ing investigations. the troops assigned to the Fifth Military Zone commit
all types of abuses against the civilian population, including the raping

of women. torture and robbery.

Hernandez Osorio showed a long list of these types of harassment. prominent
among which are the follouing: constant raping of women. who conceal the
fact out of shame. although there is testimony given by Mrs valentine Bojor-

[Text] Miguel Angel Fonseca Silva, who is the owner of two plots of land on

which marihuana and poppy plantations were discovered, was remanded to the
district judge for crimes against health.

According to information provided by Humberto Davila del Basque, agent of the
Federal Public Ministry. the investigation that was conducted caused this in-
dividual to be turned over to the competent authorities; because there are in
the settlements of Lou Amolea and Rancho del Rincon two plantations over an

area of about 1.250 and 900 square meters respectively, on which the afore-
mentioned plants were growing.

Thls individual was arrested when members of the State Judicial Police and
army forces assigned to "Operation Condor" were making their usual tour of
the high locations. and found the owner of the aforementioned land as he was
inspecting the plantations.

They immediately took him tothis town, and completed the preliminary inquiry..
The captors took some samples for analysis as convincing proof of the type
of plants that had been sown. and destroyed the rest.

in addition to the crime for which he was remanded, anseca Silva is also
regarded as n presumed murderer; and, since this is a common crime, the of-
fice of the state prosecutor was notified of his arrest, so that it could.

MEXICO N0" TRAﬂSFBR POINT FOR SOUTH AMERICAN DRUGS
Culiacan EL SOL DB SINALOA in Spanish 14 Dec 78 Sec 3 p 8

[Text] Mexico City, 13 December-Fernando Baeza, a senior official in the 0f-
fice of the Attorney General of the Republic. told EL SOL DE MEXICO that He-
xico has ceased to be the leading producer of the marihuana that is consuaed
in the United States. but has become the bridge between Central and South
America end the United States for drug traffickers.

The official based his information on the fact that, during 1977, the army
and Federal Judicial Police exterminated 75 percent of the marihusna and pop-
ply plantations in our country. and on the recept captures of Colombian. Pe-
ruvian and Hexican traffickers in the states of Chiapas and Baja California
Norte.

According to the official, this business is being combated. first of all.
with electronic sensors located onunudentifiedlanding fields operating on
the southern and northern borders of the capital of the republic.

This apparatus makes it possible to detect the presence of aircraft, and it
immediately sends the signal locating it to the radar equipment and communi-
cations systems of the Federal Judicial Police. thereby making it possible
to capture the dangerous cocaine traffickers who have been operating with

impunity.

Beeza Helendes discussed the variety of systems used to combat drug traffick-
king. and not only the plantations but the shipment to another country. which
is always the United States. the natural border with Mexico.

The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic has requested that the
United States Government exercise caution in conducting commercial transac-
tions. because the airplanes or trucks which carry the goods that are import-
ed return from Mexico loaded with drugs. He said that the judicial authori-
ties of that country have already been alerted to this.

COCAINE PROCESSING LABORATORY DISCOVERED IN ENSENADA
Mexicali LA V02 DE LA FROMTERA in Spanish 2d Dec 78 Sec B p 12

[Text] Mexicali--The Federal Judicial Police discovered a clandestine labora-
tory in which a Bolivian chemist was processing cocaine, and succeeded in
seizing from it half a kilogram of paste (the base for producing the powder),
as well as chemical products, at his residence in Ensenada. As a result of

the police operation, a ring of five individuals. who were arrested, was
broken up.

The value of the paste, of Bolivian origin and brought in by means of a unique
procedure, was not disclosed; however, it was claimed to be considerable, since
it is the base for producing a larger amount of the drug, which is the most
expensive in the world.

The agency of the Federal Public Ministry has at its disposal the Bolivians
Felix Benjamin Guzman Arancibia and Victoria Arrabe Chaver, and the Mexicans
Humberto Hughes Carbone, Yeomans Vingocheat and Victor Ayon Valencia. The
first two reside in Ensenada, where the laboratory was found; the next two
live in San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora, and the last inthe Pro-Family Life
development in this capital.

This information was provided yesterday by the assistant agent of the Federal
Public Ministry, Abdiel Lozano Chantes. who noted that the chemical compounds,
including the paste, would be sent to Tijuana, to the laboratory of the Office
of the Attorney General of the Republic located there, so that they could be
properly analyzed.

Felix Benjamin Guzman, a metallurgical chemist, arrived in Ensenada from Bo-
livia a few months ago. Before leaving his country, he soaked several of
his shirts with cocaine paste. Then, when he arrived here, he talked to
his mother, making a long-distance telephone call, and asked her to send
him the shirts. which Victoria Arzabe did. When they arrived, he removed

the paste.

The ring was discovered after the arrest of Humberto Hughes Carbone, who was
apprehended by the Federal Judicial Police recently in Los Algodones, Baja

76
California. while he was waiting tor a purchaser to whom he intended to sell
25 grams of cocaine.

He revealed to the police that Felix Benjamin had given him the drugs to sell.
As a result. the latter was arrested at his residence in anenada. The co-
caine paste was found inside a small suitcase, and in the trunk of his car
were seven plastic gallon bottles containing acetone. one containing sulfuric
acid and two flasks containing hydrochloric acid. There were also some re-
flectors. a scale, wrapping paper and two glass containers. among other things.

Hughes had confessed that Victor Ayon Valencia previously purchased several

"pedazoa" [a little over an ounce] of cocaine from him. The latter was lo-
cated and arrested at his residence in the Pro-Family Life development.

narcotics the value of which was estimated at over 500 million pesos on the
"black market" in the United States were seized and destroyed, as a result
of the untiring effort expended by the Federal Judicial Police in the states
of Nuevo Leon, Coahuila and Tamaulipas.

This announcement was made by the coordinator of the agencies of the Federal
Public Ministry in the three aforementioned states, Alfredo Aaron Juarez Ji-
menez, upon reporting the results of the statistics prepared on the produc-
tive work done by the Federal Judicial Police.

Judicial Police arrested 986 presumed drug traffickers.

Juarez Jimenez added: "This is a reflection of the persistent effort that the
Federal Judicial Police have been making in compliance with the mission that
has been assigned them by the attorney general of the republic."

He went on to say that the work done by Comdr Margarito Mendez Rico, coor-
dinator of the Federal Judicial Police in the three states had been out-
standing and effective. because he has dealt the drug traffic heavy blows
since assuming his position in this area.

Comdr Margarito Mendez Rico, for his part, declared: "We know that it is
virtually impossible to put an end to the drug traffic, but nevertheless
we shall contine to combat this type of activity on all levels, because
that is the mission that has been assigned to us."

Culiacan EL SOL DE SINALOA in Spanish 2 Dec 78 p 12

[Text] Mexico City, 1 Decenher--Eight international drug traffickers who had
been operating in five countries were arrested by the Federal Judicial Police
when they were bringing 1.38 billion pesos worth of cocaine into Mexico.

The drugs were intercepted by the federal police upon their arrival fro. Co-
lombia in a 10-seat two-engine plane which landed at the "El Desenpeao"

fern located in 0cozingo, Chiepas, situated on the banks of the Usunacinta
River. close to the Guatemalan border.

Those under arrest are: Alvaro Cardenas Anaya, Luis Crespo Rodriguez, Jose Au-
del Valdovinos Molina, Roberto Rivera Rivera, Marcos Fidel Rodriguez, Jose

dcl Carmen Pavon and Alfonso Rodriguez. The first-sentioned individual is

the head of the powerful “gang."

The arrival of the plane had been awaited since the first Sunday in November,
but for reasons that were not explained there was a delay, and it did not
arrive until last Sunday. The aircraft. a Piper Seneca II PA-36, with re-
gistration number HK-1693-P, from Colombia, brought 150 kilograas of very
pure cocaine to Mexico. to be sold firsthand to "dealers" from the United

States and Canada, for $60 million.

The attorney general of the republic turned over the investigation to Gen
Raul Mendiolea Cerecero. who assigned lst Condr Florentino Venture Rodriguez
and his partner, .163e de Jesus Mexueiro Kuntzy, to the difficult mission

christened "Operation Lazaro."

The agents mounted guards at some luxury hotels in the capital, after receiv-
lng the first information sent by the police in the United States.

The head of the ring in Mexico, Alvaro Cardenas, was followed by the police
for several days. without results. until he made contact with Roberto Rivera
Rivera, who was using a forged passport bearing the na-e Jairo Parra Gonza-

lez.

82
Subsequently. the latter managed to contact Luis Crespo and Jose Audel Val-
dovinos. who went to Chiapae to buy a farm which had a clandestine airstrip
capable of accommodating the two-engine plane in which the drugs would ar-
rive. '

When all the contacts had been made and the deal for the goods was closed.
the judicial police intervened for the first time, and captured all of the
aforementioned persons. Alvaro Cardenas Anaya was arrested at the door of
his residence at 1011 Ambatos, in the Lindaviata development, and the others
were apprehended at various hotels.

The police knew that the chief suppliers of the drugs were the Colonbians
Alonso Rodriguez and Beatriz Rivera de Rodriguez, who had originally been
the suppliers of the international trafficker Arturo Felix Coronel.

Felix Coronel died the year before last during a practice flight on a clan-
destine airstrip in the state of Mexico, where the drugs brought in from
Colombia and Peru were initially unloaded.

After his death. his assistant, Alvaro Cardenas, continued the deals with
Peruvian and Colombian traffickers, and inherited the lucrative business
which the Federal Judicial Police eliminated today.

The arrested persons, the drugs and the aircraft will be placed at the dis-
posal of the fourth district penal court.

DRUG THEFT AT HEALTH CENTER PROMPTS HEW INCINERATIOH POLICY
Ciudad Juarez Bl. FRONTBRIZO in Spanish 29 Nov 78 Sec A p 2

[Text] The agency of the Federal Public Ministry will stop sending large
amounts of strong drugs and depressants to the "A" Health Center.

This decision was made yesterday by the head of that institution for treat-
ment, Dr Heriberto Perez Gonzalez. and by the federal prosecutor, Norberto
Salinas Navarrete. to prevent another theft such as the one which occurred
recently.

‘Dr Perez Gonzalez said that, if a shipment of over 10 kilograms of drugs is
seized, it will be burned inediately.

For ercmple. when the marihuana does not exceed 10 kilograms in weight, it
will Le kept in this establishment. but for only a few days, and not for
months as in the past.

He said: "We only want to have sasples of the drugs left with us; we no long-
er want to be the custodians of large volumes; because they are a temtation
for addicts and, although there was no personal injury the last tine during
the robbery, who knows whether there might be one the next time.

"Let the federal prosecutor and the second district court be the ones to de-
cide what to do with large drug shipments. He are willing to burn them, if

they wish. "

The head of the "A" Health Center added that, from now on, they would accept
only small samples of drugs in each instance, so as to make the clinical
and chemical analyses of them which are required.

The assistant agent of the Federal Public Ministry. Arturo Sanchez Gaytan,
stated yesterday that the amount of marihuana that was stolen from the "A"
Health Center storeroo- last week was under 5 kilograms.

The social representative thinks that the apparent target of the thieves was
the safe inside of the vault. since they must have thought that it contained
heroin, cocaine and other alkaloids derived from opium, the result of the
most recent seizures made by the police.

84
If this were so. they were disappointed, because that safe was out of service
since 1962. when the combination was lost. It was recently used to hold
things other than drugs.

Sanchez Gaytsn said that the amount of marihuana that was stolen had been
established by comparing the volume of grass that was there until the day
of the incident with what was left after the nocturnal visit of two masked
individuals who threatened the guard with a pistol to force him to open the
door for them so that they could steal the safe and some "cannabis indies."

The individual making the statement said that there is no explanation of

the reasons why the person who made the disclosure representing the adainis-
tration of the treatment center claimed that the marihuana that was stolen
amounted to over 30 kilograms.

He also said that the Federal Judicial Police, who have been in charge of
the investigation since the day of the robbery. now have some "interesting
information" about the presumed thieves.

FIVE TRIED FOR MARIRUANA TRAFFICKING
Trial Court Hears Pleas
Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 23 Dec 78 p 18

{fext7 After an unexpected turn of events in their statements,
ive persons accused of supplying and trafficking in marihuana
are testifying before the Trial court again today.

What was simply a report yesterday has been confirmed by
officials (Narcotics Brigade and National Naval Prefecture)

now that it has been disclosed that the suspects had introduced
marihuana through various points along the border. The final
destination of the marihuana--as has become common lately-~were

various smoking dens in very confidential locations, preferably
in the Pocitos area.

The suspects have records of similar crimes, having served
various sentences. Recently they had been released and took

advantage of their new-found freedom to resume their profitable
business despite strict control by the authorities.

Apparently the hallucinogenic substance came in along the coast

and was received-«after payment--by contacts located in neighbore
ing countries.

Since the Judicial proceeding was extended an additional day,
investigators have nade more complete investigations in order to
get to the bottom of the matter.

In the hearings yesterday at the Trial Court level, it appears
that the suspects accused of supplying and trafficking in drugs
attempted to help their case by alleging that they were also
drug addicts, an eventuality that could affect the sentences to
be imposed.

Because of these demands on the part of the defendants, a medical

96
examination was to be ordered to determine whether their claims
were true or false.

persons accused of the crime of "Supplying Narcotics" (article 35
of law 14,294). The matter will subsequently pass to the Juris-
diction of the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Brigade.

The detainment of a 21-year old woman--the first link in the
illegal chain--allowed authorities to learn of the involvement
of the defendants. She was subsequently released through a
legal provision.

The woman had been picked up at a certain point in the Old City,
showing evident symptoms of drug addiction. the proceeding was
carried out by personnel from the PNN [- J,
who reported it--after taking complementary actions-to the
respective Brigade of the Naval Information and Intelligence
Administration, which terminated the matter after they succeeded
in arresting the four individuals involved in the illegal actions.

Imprisoned were: Luis Daniel Perez Santos, 19, Uruguayan, single,
and living at Siena 3090; Jorge Jose Postiglicni harquez, 23.

The investigation has not ended, since authorities are still

[Text] Because they are possibly linked to a vast international drug
trafficking network, the PM [Judicial Technical Police] in Zulia arrested
two 0.8. citizens who landed last Sunday in a small, light private plane
at the old Grano de Oro airport in Haracaibo.

lhe Mericans who have been held are Dillot Oruce Pile Cote Cotellie {sic},
the pilot, and his passenger, Wilson Dorl Clark Jr. and they are currently
in the DISIP [Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services] head-
quarters at Maracaibo. According to the results of the investigations.
they are to be placed in the hanthof the Judicial Technical Police today.

It has also been ascertained that the small, u.s. registered plane, car-
rying the markings N-Zlo-L, a red and white Bercraft [sic], is being taken
apart, piece by piece, at the Chinita airport, to which it was transferred
by PTJ officials, in order to discover whether any bags of cocaine were
hidden in the fuselage.

The Plane Landed Sunday

According to information provided by the pilot, the plane had flown in
from the neighboring (Dutch) island of Aruba and made a forced landing due
to a fuel shortage. The landing took place on Sunday, December 31, on the
runway of the old airport, where a department of the University of Zulia
is located.

Some hours earlier, this same plane had spent several hours (it was at dawn)
flying over the airspace above Harecaibo.

me pilot, Billot Bruce File Cotelie [sic] explained that he had eade a
forced landing because the dials on his panel showed a fuel shortage.

96
He explained to the police authorities of Zulia that this was the reason
for his forced landing and that his destination had been the town of
Barranquilla (Colombia).

Despite these statements, the Zulin PTJ, regether with DISlP officials,
at the present time are questioning the two Americans.

During the course of the day, the American consul in the capital of Zulia,
yesterday went to the lockup where the men are being held in order to find
out how they are.

what is more, from extra-official sources, it was learned that the police
find it strange that the two Americans should have chosen this date for a
pleasure trip. One spokesman said it was possible that they wanted to make
use of the holiday to transport this type of drug.

It was also stated that yesterday the information was communicated to
INTERPOL. with a request that the 0.3. provide background data on File
Cotellie and Earl Clark Jr.

Caracas, 2 Jan 79 (Ven. Press)--0fficisls of 0181? placed two 0.8. citizens
in the hands of the PTJ. The two are Bruce Pyle Cotelli, aged 30, of New
York, an airplane salesman, and his friend, Gilson [sic] Earl Clark Jr,
aged 36, of Ohio, a businessman. They were arrested moments after landing
at the Grano de Oro airport, in Maracaibo, Zulia state, with their leech-
craft, "021-202 [sic] registration markings, piloted by Cotelli.

The information available at the Ministry of the Interior indicates that
these men were arrested as suspects charged with being involved in drug
traffic, who were on their way to Colombia. However, when their plane
ran short of fuel, they were forced to land at the above-mentioned air-
port. The 0151? officials who keep on the alert lost not time in detain-
ing the men. During the interrogation. both Fyle Cotteli and Earl Clark
Jr. insisted that they were forced to land in Zulia state because of the
bad wheathcr prevailing in the area in addition to insufficient fuel to
enable them to reach Colombia. where they were expecting to handle busi-
ness connected with their profession as aircraft salesmen.

LEGISLATION SOUGHT TO CONPISCATB LAND OF OPIUH GROHERS
Cairo THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE in English 28 Dec 78 p 3

[Text] In a new crackdown on the eve of the traditional five-month
opiun harvest period that begins in January. the government has proposed
new legislation to deal with the problea of opium growing and it seems
likely to win approval by parlianent.

"He are changing the law so that the government will seize the land of
anyone caught planting opium or any other narcotic plants." Gen Sami
Farrag, head of the anti-narcotics administration. told a news confer-
ence.

Growers currently face stiff fines and jail sentences ranging from six
months to 25 years. but the loss of land would affect not only the grower
but his entire family.

The fertile Nile valley produces what experts say is some of the most
potent opiun in the world, and newly released statistics point to a
dramatic increase in illicit cultivation of the deadly poppy.

The flowering poppy bush. from which the sap is used to lake opium, is sown
with cotton and other crops in fields along the Nile River.

Growing Centre

The traditional growing centre is a 250-square-mile area around Assiut.
This year, for the first time. international drug traffickers from Europe
and the United States scouted Egypt as a possible source of opium, from

which heroin is made. reliable sources said.

Narcotics agents, however. seized most of the opium harvest last year and
the rest has been absorbed by an estimated half-million local addicts.

'Conccrn persists that the cultivation will spread to new areas outside the

traditional growing centre and that a surplus domestic production would
attract drug -kingpins from abroad.

99
UPPGV ESYPt has been a centre for opium growing since the days or the
Pharoahs and the poppy plant can be seen on temple walls of ancient
Thebespeer Luxer.

Traditional Users

Peasants have been the traditional users. chewing raw opium or drinking
it in their ten. but experts say there are signs users now include young
urbanites. Police say there is no indication that the raw opium is being
distilled to make norphine or production (or medical purpose in Egypt.

Statistics released by the anti-drug agency show that in 1973 only

b.523 opium plants were seized in police raids, but in the first six month:
of this year six million plants were destroyed. Between 1976 and 1977

the seizures increased 286 percent and there is no sign of a slacken-

ing in the upward trend.

in a report on spies and hashish growing, the anti-narcotics agency said
the increase in seizures clearly pointed to a rise in total production.

"In the last few years statistics indicated an increase in the cultiva-
tion of narcotic plants," the report said.

The study also stated that "growers have started switching from the cul-
tivation of marijuana to growing opium because of the enormous profit
involved."

Per Capita

Sources estimate that a farmer can earn 35.000 dollars an acre growing
opium in a country where the per capita incose is only 250 dollars a
year.

"That is hell of an incentive to grow opium." one ﬂestern experts said.
”You can't find another crop that has that value here."

The sources eatiaate the illicit market value of the crop seized in
l977 at 7 million dollars but say it would be worth at least three tines
that on the international narket.

By comparison with world growing centres such as Turkey. Southeast Asia
and Nexico, the Sgyptian production is "very small." Hr Farrag said.

Seizure

For example. Egypt's l977 seizure amounted to only about 200 acres,
while in nexico a raid last year involved some 20,000 acres of opium.

But the potential is nonetheless evident, and Mr Farrag noted Egypt's
opium is the “best in the world." because of the rich soil.
"It's a beginning and if we are not firm. if we don't eradicate the

a well-planned action in cooperation with .‘oreign police and custoas

alongside the pier in Kiel, and based on what they observed on board
five persons were arrested. It is known that "hard" drugs were
confiscated on board the "Crown Prince Harald.“ Police do not wish

to disclose inforaation about me case because the investigation is jut
beginning and it is possible that more persons will be involved. It

is also possible that the police have good intonation which could lead
to more drug aeinurea. The drugs which were seized are now at Oslo
police headquarters for further investigation. It is not clear what
types of drugs are included. WNPOSTEN sources indicate that it was
either aaphetaaines or heroinuor possibly both-which was found on the

ARTICLE LOOKS AT DRUG ENFORCEMENT EFFORT
Lisbon EXPRESSO in Portuguese 16 Oct 78 p 5R

(Article: "Drug Treatment: Atmosphere of Unrest Calls for Immediate
lnvestigation"]

[Text] The Drug Treatment Study Center ICBPD], strangely, is subordinate

to the Presidency of the Council and not. as would be entirely indicated

by the nature of its subject matter. the Ministry of health and Social
Affairs. One of those most directly responsible for such a state of affairs
was. we are told. Dr Almeida Santos. Specifically, when he was in the
government he was minister of tutelage. a task about which. moreover, he
complained bitterly. we wanted to meet with Dr Almeida Santos to clear

up some details. but at the moment this was not possible.

"hat is happening in the CBPD?
"hat is going on in the Drug Treatment Study Center?

The question is pertinent and is justified, in the first place. by the
unrest prevailing in its various departments; it is further Justified by

the apparent domination of bureaucratic administrative criteria over
eminently therapeutic criteria (rather than the bias toward therapy which

is internationally recognized as more valid) and even further justified by
the resignations noted. Commandant Comes da Silva, who held the position

of coordinator. resigned in December 1977; in June it was Dr Afonso Ribeiro's
tu.n to quit. as director of the southern regional center; and in July

Dr Cotta Guerra resigned as president of the CBPD Rational Directorate.

By no means could such events fail to affect the institution's activities,
whether at the level of personnel. particularly specialists. or that of
the users. despite the praises given the organization and the high regard
in which it is held by the United Nations Narcotics Division. reiterated
in June of last year.

109
To combat the traffic and use of dress, the sixth provisional government
created a coaplex structure which. in summary, consists of a center
responsible for problems of drug use (the Drug Treatment Study Center),
another center concerned viah drun traffic (the Drug Investigation and
Control Center) and a 'nordinnting agency (Coordinating Office to Combat
Drugs). At that time the coordinating office was assigned the duty of
l“asauring coordination of the activities of the two centers"/ [in boldface].
granting operational and administrative autonomy to the CICD [Drug Investi-
gation and Control Center] and only administrative autonomy to the other.

After careful observation of what is happening in the centers. the present
government must be questioned soout the government as of then and about
the reasons for certain appointments and consequent activities. There are
:hnse who discOVur "rap~level power struggles." struggles in which the
apparent motivations will not be easily understood if we consider the kind
of services to be rendered.

As is known. the use of drugs is a phenomenon closely related to situations
of social maladjustment and defiance of power structures. Consequently.

to join or link this service to government agencies and, in this case, to
the highest one of all, the council presidency, is to contribute to polit-
icizing the drug problem. enlarging it artificially and involving it in the
contradictions of a system that. on behalf of a dominant culture (in which
the drug-traffic mafia has a place of distinction), attempts to suppress

a pheneeenon of the counter-culture. that of drug use. The closer the
problet is to to the government and the more dependent it is upon it.

the harder it becomes to evaluate it impartially. It is thus not understood
at all why it is subordinated to the council presidency. Dr Alaeida Santos
overlooked a simple fact: integration or rehabilitation of the addict

must be done in these centers without any idea of surveillance of the
person making use of these services.

Coordinating Office

According to DL [Decree-Law] 790/76. the coordinator assures coordination

of activities of the two distinct centers, devoted respectively to treatment
of drug use(CEPD) and to suppression of drug traffic (CICD). That decree-law
simply defines asymmetric areas of authority for each of the centers.

Denying the CBPD operational autonomy. the coordinating office reserves for
itself authority to direct overall policy of drug-addiction prevention.

The CCCD [Coordinating Office to Combat Drugs], however, does not have
personnel capable of performing such functions. According to the judgment

of the General Directorate of Public Service. this agency is distinguished
precisely by its lack of such specialists.

110
It is also fitting to cite the fact that control of treatment and also of
suppression by the some authority will inevitably contaminate the two
operations. Rehabilitation of the addict under conditions of anonymity

to which he submits voluntarily, convinced that he will not be incriminated
or penalized. and identification of the addict subject to measures of security
and punishment are irreconcilable situations that must never be confused
within the responsibilities of one and the same agency. Presence of the

CICD in the coordinating office's organization chart, moreover, increases

the system's ambiguity even further. Not simply the name ("...Inveatigation...
Center“). but also its very methodology of operation, gives its image the
aura of a shadowy agency. since it functions in tandem with another traffic-
suppression agency, the Narcotics Division of the Judiciary Police.

Ambiguity of Dual Status

After Commandant Comes ds Silva resigned in December 1977, Almeida Santos
appointed Dr Armando Rocha, whose doctorate is in geography and who was the
sports director of the previous regime, to fill the position of coordinator
temporarily. Associated with the CEPD from the beginning as administrative
director, he was later reintegrated in the civil service and simultaneously
requisitioned from the NBC [Ministry of Education and Culture) to be
responsible for "duties of general administration; that is, administration
of personnel. materials, budgetary funds, and other duties that constitute
simply ways and means of assuring activities of merely administrative work."

By combining distinct responsibilities, those of CEPD administrative director
and GCCD coordinator, in one official, Almeida Santos concentrated in the

some persOn absolute power over both agencies, although retaining the
ambiguity of dual status.

This ambiguity could not help but produce the effects that result from

it, if we also consider Dr Armando Roche's preparation for such work, which
is, as we said above, in geography.

Situations of Dual Authority

Frequently the administrative director, forgetting sectoral guidelines of
preventive policy, gives orders of an administrative nature that contradict
operational requirements and weaken therapeutic measures. Such is the case
with the daily boarding charge of 22 escudos that the addicts must pay if
they wish to be treated in the hospital center. Since the great majority
come from a social class with limited funds and are generally estranged

from their families, such a requirement forces them-~whenever no one takes
responsibility for payment in advance--to fall back on a delcaration of
poverty. given by the Parish Board, with inevitable loss of the anonymity
promised by the hospitalization center specialists to all who wish to be
treated there. Such an aberration then confuses the addicts's desire for

a cure with a fear of eventual reprisals. With the further aggravation that
the institution is surrounded by an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion
that can eventually lead to the specialists' being viewed as a kind of police.

111
The climate prevailing within the institute is not very suitable to the
uiesion for uhich it was created. Inquiries are frequently ordered for
trifling and ridiculous reason», with threats of disciplinary action.
Furthermore, there is an increasing numoor of situations that become the
pretext for controlling the actJVlties of specialists. through adminis-
trative esployees who. in certain cases. must submit confidential daily
reports of events.

CLOSING 0F HARDS HURTS STOCKHOLM DRUGS TREATMENT
Stockholm SVBNSKA DAGBLADET in Swedish 15 Dec 78 p 2
liditorial: “Crisis in the Treatment of Drug Addictsﬁ7

[Text] The situation for drug addicts applying for treatment of acute
conditions is catastrophic. Since the detoxification wards were closed
in the county hospital recently, no treatment can be obtained. This af-
fects not only the addicts who fail to get the approximately 40 beds that
were available, but also the active efforts to identify addicts, and con-
siderable efforts of that kind are made.

The idea of the so-called treatment chain for narcotics addicts is for
continuity between the various forms of treatment to prevail--that is,
between the efforts to identify addicts, the detoxification, the follow-
up treatment and support during adjusument to normal social life. These
are not activities which can be detached from each other and carried out
individually. The elimination of one phase in this continuity destroys
the possibility of an effective form of treatment which produces results.

That is precisely what has happened now as a result of the closing of the
beds for the treatment of acute conditions_ because of a shortage of person-
nel. Ruth Karnek /Socisl Democratic Party/ pointed this out, among_other
thing_, in a letter to social county council member Nils hallsrby [liberal
Party]. She calls for a redistribution of personnel from the psychiatrists'
group within the medical service.

Naturally, the shortage of personnel is the principal cause. at present,

of the crisis which has arisen, but the reasons go deeper than that. Since
the beginning of the 1970s, the question of the treatment of drug addicts
has been tossed back and forth between the county council and the munici-
polities. Who is to have the responsibility? They came to an agreement,
purely on principle, that the matter of who is in charge is a local govern-
ment matter. But the problem is not that simple. There are practical and
economic reasons to indicate that many municipalities in the Stockholm area
have neither the capabilities nor the resources necessary to take over a
responsibility which the county council simply feels it wants to get rid of.

113
The protracted and tough negotiations regarding who is going to be in
charge have now produced a uituotion where the drug addicts are the ones
who suffer. the personnel seeking to identify individuals in acute need

of treat-ent have lost their principal notivation in the treatment chain--
th1t is, detoxificctiun--und the load is beeasing larger and more unmanage-
able in the psychiat'ieta’ treatment iacilities end the free treatment
facilities. with these conditions as a background, it is only a question
of tile before the effects of the personnel shortage also appear in these
areas.

Although many people tried to shut their eyce to the drug abuse which began
to appear at the end of the 19‘03 and has become note and more of a reality
during the l970s, there is =c reason why one should not open one's eyes.

A government committee has recently been set up which is to survey drug
abuse in Sweden The UNO (Connittee on the Extent of Drug Abuse) will be
ready with its iirst report next fall.

Such a survey is necessary so that it will be possible to counteract drug
abuse-~preferahly through preventive neasures at an early stage. Drug
abuse. it is believed in the 0N0. is an indicator of how the society is
functioning on the whole. That is what nsny people who want to do some-
thing about it but do not know how have not yet realised.
