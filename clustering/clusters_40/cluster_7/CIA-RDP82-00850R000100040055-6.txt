'I’ARIS MATCII' DRUGS STORY REFUTED
Bogota CROMOS in Spanish lb Mar 79 pp 12-15

[Article by Santiago Tapias: "The Colombian Marijuana Traffic Revealed
to the world by the French")

[Textl First it was the American magazine TIME with its cover story and
all the rest which caused world connotion. Now it is the French. with a
lead article by Roger Holeindre in the most recent issue of the weekly
PARIS MATCH and a report by Tony Coniti through the Gamma Agency. This is
an extravagant tale of the Colombian connection which puts our country in
the forefront in international news again, to the delight of fools. and
helps foreigners to distinguish our country from Bolivia.

Marijuana. soldiers. weapons and death-~these are the elements coupon to
these photographs of Colombia presented by the French to the world. This
is the national image absorbed on the level of journalism outside our
frontiers. we want you to look closely and read the texts carefully, to
which end we quote the introduction to the original and the figure captions
which appeared.

PARIS MATCH begins its issue with a headline followed by a text which reads
as follows: "in 1973, the 'French connection' collapsed. destroyed thanks
to police cooperation among a number of European and American countries,
after enjoying front-page coverage in all the newspapers for eight years.
Today the United States must deal with an equally serious threat: the
'Colombian connection.‘ by means of which dozens of tons of marijuana raised
by peasants in the northern part of Colombia are shipped by vessel or by
plane to the 60 million Americans who smoke this drug. The Colombian navy
has been mobilized against the drug traffickers who are supported by the
Mafia. Our special correspondent. Roger Holeindre, paid a visit to the
scene of events to observe the 'raffie and control of it and to provide us
with this text and these pictures."

The French Gamma Agency, for its part, entitled its article "Bogota-~The
Colombian Connection," adding in a subtitle that "80 percent of the marijuana

b0
consumed in the United States comes from Colombia. Traffic worth millions

. . . " This is a brief text, a scant page.

"Columbia is mobilizing, not against the guerrilla fighters but in an effort
to put an end to the traffic in soft drugs which is reaching tremendous
proportions."

"At the beginning of the year, special brigades, an army converted into a
police force, a country surrounded by patrols."

"The government in Bogota does not want the country to become the Thailand
at marijuana. Colombia supplies 80 percent of the marijuana consumed in

the United States by millions of young people, at an average of 65 tons per
day."

"A gigantic transport operation begins in the mountains and the deserts

of Colombia, where Guajira peasants in the northern part of the country
raise the precious weed. The traffic is so extensive that it has now been
dubbed the 'Colombian connection' by the American press, after the ‘French
connection' which was destroyed in 1973 when the dealers in Marseilles were
arrested."

"On 1 November 1978, the Colombian government declared war on marijuana.
Since then Guajira, a province on the Venezuelan border, has been in a state
of seige. The roads are watched as are the skies, where air force heli-
copters and jets attempt to intercept the mysterious flights of the small
planes loaded with the weed."

"The drug control office has estimated that the cultivation of and
trafficking in drugs provides some 70,000 persons with a good living. They
share an annual income totaling 20 billion pesos. And all of this goes on
under the benevnlent eye of the Mafia, which organizes the traffic from
inside the country. with all the means available to it, its political con-
nections, and if necessary its own army."

“Bogota has established a second brigade, commanded by General Jose Abarca
and with headquarters in Barranquilla. to deal with this situation."

"In a three-month period, the men in the second brigade seized almost 3, 000
tons of marijuana, using patrols and constant surveillance of the 'enemy.‘
This represents some l0 million francs gone up in smoke. As soon as the
weed is seized it is burned. A thousand drug traffickers have been arrested.
They face 10 years' imprisonment. Also 65 trucks, 35 vessels and 20 air-
craft havc been confiscated and are being kept in a special hangar at the
Puerta Villa military base. This does not include the light aircraft
heavily loaded with the drug which have crashed into the sea and are then
washed up on the beach by the waves."

hl
"nut this is just a drop in the bucket, for marijuana continues to be
cultivated on at least 150.000 hectares, and it is still in some way reaching

the American consumers for whom it provides an illusion of a few minutes of
happinvna."

 

"Groups of carabineers patrol the mountains in search of hidden plantings
or mule convoys transporting the drug." The officers' uniforms locates
them in the Bogota National Parks, rather than in the planting zone.

 

"These are young soldiers of peasant origin combating drug traffic. They

do so without enthusiasm, but with determination." A caption alongside says:
"The Colombian navy has decided to halt this scandal even at the risk of a
popular rebellion." This is pure sensationalism.

b2
"A patrol stops a bus. The soldiers search the passengers hoping to find
bundles of bills of doubtful origin." Without a doubt this is an inaccurate.
deceitful caption. In addition, there is an error in geography. These

passengers and policemen are in Bosota and not Guajira, as indicated in the
report.

 

"The police burned a quantity of marijuana they seized. The children
gather up what Heed did not burn in order to sell it." The Barranquilla
bridge is seen in the background of the photograph. As far as is known.
the Atlantic coast authorities have never burned marijuana here.
Real photograph: with a false caption: "Drug traffickers selling the weed

by night from a truck (with eyes blocked out). It is being weighed on the
truck for the purchaser on the left. The police will catch them by surprise
and will burn the marijuana on the spot." Nothing could be more false. These
are CROHOS photographs, and the individuals with their eyes blocked out are
not drug traffickers but actually authorities. As can be seen, the story

has been distorted.

U:
"A man captured with cocaine hidden under his clothing." This photograph
was not taken in Columbia. The drug traffickcr is not Colombian, nor is
the pnlicuman. Note thu badge on the latter's shirt.

 

"A drug sullcr arrested in Bogota." This could not be. The clothing of

the pulicnman and thv arrested man show that they were not in Bogota but in
a hot climate.

Lopez Vargas for possession and sale of psychotropic substances.

Upon making their preliminary statement to the second district judge. Mor-
tinez Villarreal and Lopez Vargas adsitted their guilt.

The former stated that, on the day of his arrest by the federal agents. the
latter found a 20-peso bill in one of his shoes wrapped around a small dose
of cocaine which he had bought from an individual named Guillermo Lopez Var-
gas. The person under arrest also said that someone had asked him to ob-

tain 100 kilograss of marihusna. and he met with Lopez who promised to pro-

eo-deiendant. Guillermo Lopez Vargas. was released on ball of 5,000 pesos,
without prejudice. for lack of evidence with which to convict him.

Lopez Vargas was released because the second district judge was of the opin-
ion that he was not presumed guilty of committing a crime against health

in the degree of possession and sale of psychotropic substances. Both were
captured by the Federal Judicial Police on 17 March. The agents arrested
Amado in Nueva Ciudad Guerrero. because they had a tip that he was engaged

(Editorial: "Kill the Killersl"l

[Text] Suddenly and without Introductions Shaykh Bashir al-Jumayyil has
become a social worker on the pages of the phalangist AL-‘AHAL newspaper.

Theaiorementioned Shaykh has started a devastating caspaign against hash-
ish and all kinds of drugs. Theaforementioned paper had already published
an article in two installments about the drug addiction problem in the
eastern region from a political and health viewpoint.

The newspaper crowned its campaign by an interview with Shaykh Bashir who
"rattled and attacked" in the area of hashish and drug laboratories. He
mentioned several things about the smuggling bands. the marketing networks
and the dens of the addicts. he accused whoever he wanted to accuse and
held the state as well as some rich people and the "velvet class" men
responsible. He concluded with an admonition and warning about trial and
prosecution by the "Lebanese Front.”

But Skaykh Bashir has forgotten in the euphoria of his enthusiasm to give
any explanation why this evil has spread around and the reasons why his
troops issued their orders to pursue those who are working in this field.

Of course. the forgetfulness of the son of sl-Shaykh Pierre is intentional
in order to hide the responsibility of "the family" for this evil in the
stage of defending "God and the Country."

Shaykh Bashi. has ignored the responsibility of the Kata'ib party for
making hashish smoking easy and encouraging people to become addicts since
the Lebanese war started. Shaykh Bashir did not mention that the first to
spread drugs among the fighters were he. his followers and the National
Liberal party members. Their sis was to encourage the youth to wage a
holy war to protect the Cedar and its dependents.

57
The leader of the isolationist forces has forgotten that he gave his
[Inhivrs opium and caealne injections of every sort and kind in order
to fight the aliens and the other faction in Lebanon.

he ignored the fact that nine-tenths of the dens he had mentioned
operated under the sanagelent of his party's leadership and its directions.

The question now is: "hat has sade the "Lebanese Front” take its deci-
sion to fight this evil. as it said?

infarantion indicates that the leadership of the "Front" has felt the
dangers of drug addiction spreading among students and youths in the
regions under its reign of terror. which helped to spread crime. theft
and mass murder.

And then. the leadership of the "Front" thought of fighting drugs and
hashish when it discovered that this weapon is no longer serving it in
fighting the foreigners and the other faction of Lebanon. but it had
turned to be a self-destructive weapon which helped destroy the backbone
of al-Junnyyil and Shan-un militias.

Drugs have changed during the 4 years from a substance which aroused the
fighters against the external enemy to a substance that contributed to
disintegration within their ranks and to fighting against each other.

That is why the parties of the "Front" have moved to save what can be
saved after drugs become dominant along students and youths in the schools
and the districts.

Since it is not possible to keep silent about the spreading of the crime.

AL-‘AHAL newspaper led the funeral invented by the party of al-Jusayyil's
family.

POLICE DETECTIVE DISCUSSBS WOOLING EXTENT
Copenhagen smmesn: TIDENDE in Danish 12 Her 79 p 3

[Article by Bent Bak Andersen: "Only 10 Percent of All narcotics
Confiscnted"]

[Text] The police daily confiscate hashish. morphine. heroin. cocaine.

and other narcotics to the value of millions. but many experienced

policemen believe that confiscated quantities mount to only about 10 percent
of what is actually brought into Demark.

Nobody can give exact figures because nobody knows hou many drug addicts
there are in Demark and nobody knows how much they use daily of the
dangerous drugs.

'Ihe most exact figure anyone dares quote is between 5,000 and l0,000.

"He dare not aim at a precise figure, but the problem of hard hit drug
addicts is not lessening." says Police Assessor Mikael Kyngbo, deputy

chief the juridical section of the narcotics police.

"Not alone the psychic and social problems caused by drug addiction are
frightening. He are conviced that by far the most dominant part of
crime is centered on drug addiction." Astronical counts of money are
turned over daily in narcotics circles. Syringe-using addicts spend on
the average between 1,000 and 2.000 kroner daily for drugs. and those
hardest hit all the way up to 10,000 kroner.

To get the money to cover their needs. addicts are in almost 100 percent
of the bases forced into crime, such as theft. robbery. swindles, or
prostitution.

Daily Consumption of 10 Million
At a low estimate. heroin. morphine, cocaine. paki pills are dealt in

daily to the amount of about 10 million kroner. Nobdy knows what the
men behind the deals do with the easily earned eoney.

59
Some of it is of course used to send couriers to the producing countries
to bring in the drugs. But profits are so huge that many Danes have
becune wealthy by dealing in drugs. Some people guess that some of the
maney is in Swiss bank accounts.

The result of the exploitation by the cynical men behind the drug traffic
of weak souls seeking to eernrm from the problems of daily life via drugs
was in I978 80 80 [sic] deaths.

[Question] Can nothing affective be done to help addicts with whom the
police come into contact?

[Answer] It would be fine if we could establish better cooperation with
the social and health authorities and the treatment centers. But there
seems to be a lack of trust, difficult to overcome."

Trust

"On the other hand, at times our men in the narcotics police and the
disorder police succeed in creating a condition of trust with addicts.
This can result in our receiving tips and clues which may lead as to
dealers and suppliers," says Mikael Lyngbo.

Many addicts who wish to be weaned off drugs or mere maintenance, so
that they can try to get back to a more meaningful life, are deserted
by the social authorities, most often because of lack of capacity in
the treatment centers.

After a prison sentence or after treatment, these people return to the
pulsing life and cannot foresee consequences. They end up once more

in the drug milieu and becane dependent upon drugs, brought to the country
by cynical men who deal with death as their assistant.

The number of addicts continues to increase in the Copenhagen area, while
some larger provincial cities report stagnation. In Aarhus the lower
age limit along drug addicts encountered by the police is 13—11. years.

In Copenhagen the youngest known addict is 11. He injected himself with
raw opium. In Copenhagen the disorder patrol often encounters children
of 13-15 dependent upon hard narcotics.

Thirteen-Year-Old Addicts

The narcotics police in Aarhus often encounter children sniffing thinning
liquids. A policeman describes this as the first stage on the road to
such harder drugs as heroin. morphine, and cocaine.

"The people using hard drugs are steadily coming from younger age groups.
He have noted an increase among 13 and lS-year-olds, who perhaps do not
know what they are getting into," says Police Inspector Jorgen Iversen of
Aarhus.
"The method the pushers use is to sell the drugs at 'dmping' prices

to potential users. and when these have become dependent upon the drug.
the pushers raise prices to the normal market level. They have obtained
one more custmer and a victim on the road to sure death," says

Police Inspector Jorgen Women. The children the police encounter on
the street or in parks where they stand around sniffing or injecting
themselves with drugs. are turned over to child care authorities in the
hope that they can be helped out of the dangerous milieu.

Omissioner Kjeld Pedersen. He is among the policemen who ‘ere at

"When for the first time I offered my help in the schools I almost had
to sneak in by the back door, but fortunately the school authorities later
discovered that it was prevention we were after.

"For 2 years I lectured in youth schools, colleges, high schools, and
primary schools, reaching a total of 70,000 people, who fortunately
proved to show a positive attitude toward the danger of 'nerely
sampling' hashish or marijuana."

Police emissioner Kjeld Pedersen of Pedersen of Odense has via studies
of American studies of drug addicts convinced many youths that if one's
psyche is motivated toward "fleeing from the problems of the day" the
risk of being caught is very high.

Buried Deep in the Soul

"Something is buried very deeply in the souls of people who become drug
addicts. Many feel powerless and under pressure, and when they get into
drugs the way out is most often impossible.

"As early as in the middle '60s a few alert people had their eyes open
to the problem, but the responsible authorities, including physicians,
did not think the problem very serious. and if it was they would
certainly deal with it.

62
“But where are they today? The vague attitude and lack of clearsightedness
is still the predominant attitude, and nobody seams to be able to benefit

from the experience gained. among other places, in England." says
Kjell Pedersen.

In England no addicts were completely cured, but their nunbors stagnated

because they could enter public centers to receive their daily ration
of methadone.

Controlled Maintenance

"But the trouble with the English maintenance method was that the patients
did not have to take the medicine with the attendants watching; they

could merely take it with them. Consequently, many of them went out and
sold it in the streets.

"If we are to have a well functioning network of clinics in Den-ark

it must operate with a certain control of the addicts and there should
be trust between the personnel and the addicts. The trouble with the
present system is that rapid weaning away from drugs is attanpted. and I
do not believe that the number of 'cured' addicts is even approxinetely
as large as the clinic personnel claim," says Kjeld Pedersen.

"tht we must avoid in methadone treatment here at home is to believe
that we can cure addicts, so that they are completely free of the drug.
Almost nobody has so strong a psyche that he can be completely weaned
away from a drug he may have taken for years."

Help for Youth

"If one could only make some politicians realize that this artificial,
idealized attitude on template cure is babbling nonsense we would be
getting somewhere.

"In Odense great results have been obtained with the information cmnpeign.
It is known that very few of the 'merchents of death' have dared begin
selling drugs. Young people who listened to the lectures in many places
on Funen have simply telephoned the police when they saw anybody trying
to sell narcotics.

"we are wen} grateful to the alert people who have given us help. It
has caused the problem to be far from as great here on Punen as it is in
most of the cities of the country.

"Hhi is in my spare time I traveled to schools and associations giving
lectures. the police began close cooperation with the social authorities.

This has been of inestimable help because we got into very close personal
contact with already caught addicts.

"It is a fatal error to believe that the police alone can handle the
increasing drug criminality. It can perhaps take the top off the market,

63
lmt without the help of addicts. pushers, and others acquainted with the
dealer network it is n hopeless task.

"The only way of getting help fro: the addicts is to offer them help
in getting then: out of the drug environment. Thereby the soil of the
criminal market is reduced to a considerable degree and the considerable

attendant crine will save s .I .1y millions." says Police emissioner
Kjeld Pedersen.

[Text] With the arrest of ten Italians and Egyptians at Elsinore Friday
afternoon. the police at Elsinore and Billered believe that they are now
approaching the end of one of the biggest narcotics affairs in the history
of the Danish crisinal police.

The detection of the narcotics group began last fall with the arrest of the
well-known highway-an. Hogans 'Nivi' Petersen. his girl friend and soee of
his close friends.

In the course of the approximately five months that have gone by since then.

foreigners. with isportation of heroin and distribution of the drug to heroin
users.

The chief of the Crininal Investigation Departsent. Inspector Preben Andersen,
said yesterday that he did not wish to reveal how such they had seized hiday
afternoon, nor did he wish to reveal how such they had seized in total.

Proben Andersen said. "It was a large quantity that we seized yesterday. but
it was not of the sane negnitude as the one which we seized at the Copenhagen
Airport a few days ago." (Editors: 1.5 kilos of pure heroin. worth 1.5 sillion
kroner in the black Iarket.)

The police did not wish to state what the charges would be against the 65
persons. Nor did they wish to reveal the amount of money that had been con-
fiscated.

"He are not certain that we have caught all those who are involved. Il'hat is
why we do not wish. at this point. to say how much we actually know, but we
are. no doubt. approaching the end of the investigation,” Prehen Andersen said.
The ten foreigners who were arrested yesterday all live at Elsinore and in
the surrounding area. he police stepped in after having kept their resi-
dences under surveillance for some days.

Several of the 65 persons charged in the cases have. for several years. been

[Text] "Preparations are being made for a stronger effort at all levels.
in social affairs, the custom. and the pol ice. against the wave of drugs.
Personally. 1 consider the situation now is serious." Minister of Justice
lager Louise Valle told N11! [Norwegian News Service].

She asserts that it is the intention to use the resources that are necessary.
but that it is too early to say in detail how the effort will he made.

As a part of that effort. Minister of Justice Valle will have a meeting
with Minister of Social Affairs Ruth Ryste next Tuesday [20 March]. But it
is clear that the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and
Administration Inst also be actively involved in coordination of the mea-
sures to be taken against the drug problem.

The minister of justice says that the whole drug problem is now being ana-
lyzed to clarify how the resources must be primarily brough' to bear.

"We are also aiming at better coordination of existing control and assist-
ance measures." she says.

Statements by experts within the police and health services in recent days
show clearly that hard core addiction has greatly increased, especially in
liast Norway. just in the course of the last year. And in Oslo there has
been a great increase in the number of break-ins in houses and apartments.
These break-ins are directly connected with the drug abusers' need for
money for the drugs.

Minister Inger Louise Valle says that the increased effort on the drug
problem is an implementation of the intentions stated in the crime report.

"it is a part of our whole philosophy to look at the connection between
drug abuse. alcohol abuse, and criminality. The idea is not simply to at-
tack the individual thieveries, but also to try to prioritize what lies
behind them." she says.

'Ihe minister of justice had an meeting Thursday [15 Mnrch] with the [Nants'
m-gnnizut ion "Action Against Drug Addiction" to get their views on how the
drug problem can best be reduced.

One of the representatives, Rolf Kvam, tells N11! that among other things
they pointed out that snifﬁng .s on the increase again, and that children
all the way down to 9 and 10 years old are using glue and various thinners
in that way.

"we think the remedial measures are new setting in too late. Every single
youth that cones in contact with the drug problem must come under observa-
tion at an earlier point in time than is now the case."

[Text] "There is every reason to believe that abuse of heroin
has spread to all parts of the country." Police Sgt P51 3. ilerg
of the Oslo police told AFTENPOSTEN that recent confiscations
of heroin show that the drug has become very easily obtainable
in Oslo. and that from there it has spread over the country.

'“I‘oday more heroin is being seized than morphine. and often the heroin
seized is of the strongest type," says Berg. it is assumed that Oslo has
become a sort of sales center for heroin users from other parts of Norway.

Nobody knows just how great quantities of heroin are snuggled in and sold
in Norway. but it is no longer a matter of insignificant amounts.

"We cannot compare the heroin abuse in Oslo with conditions in the big

metropolises of Europe. but it is clear that heroin has becoae a comon
drug on the Norwegian market. too," he says.

Access to hard drugs is steadily increasing in the northern comtries, with
the exception of Finland. The drug world is becoming more and more brutal-

ized, and the authorities in the various countries describe the situation
as serious.

That was made clear at a Scandinavian contact meeting in Copenhagen this

week. Norway was represented by Torbjdm Mork, director of public health.
and by representatives of the public prosecutor's office.

Mort told N'IB [Norwegian News Service] that the reports the Health Direc-

torate has received indicate that heroin is now to be found in all parts
of Norway.

"Altogether, ll! of 24 field sections we have recently had contact with can

say that heroin has been sold sporadically in local user circles," says
