RANGOON PAPER 0" SUCCESS IN ANTINARCOTICS DRIVE
BKleSOS Rangoon LOKIBA PYBITHU N221“ in Burmese 14 Aug 81 p 4
(Editorial: "Accelerating Success in Antinarcotics Drive"]

[Summary] The success in the antinarcotic drive-«which has been launched as a

national campaign under the guidance of the Burma Socialist Program Party [BSPP]-—
is accelerating.

The narcotic drugs law was passed in the country in 1974 to eradicate narcotic
drugs. Under the law, sentences ranging from 5 years imprisonment to the death
penalty can be given for various drug offenses.

"In accordance with this law, action has been taken against persons using narcotic
drugs and persons engaged in the narcotic drugs trade. During 1980, there were
2,é95 durg cases. These included 835 opium cases; 536 heroin cases; 292 narijuana
cases; and other 832 cases which included failure to register and possession of a
syringe. Narcotic drugs cases declined in 1980 compared to 1979 in which 6, 363
narcotics cases were reported."

In addition to legal action, sntinarcotic drugs control work in the fields of pre-
vention, treatment, rehabilitation and drug education among students was carried
out folloiwng the formation of the central narcotics control board.

The national antinarcotic drugs control campaign is being carried out jointly by
the army. the people's police force. public servants and the local people. "The
narcotic drugs suppression work was carried out like a military operation. Be-

tween the 1974-75 opium cultivation season and the 1980-81 season, a total of

37,677 acres of opium fields were destroyed. Between 1975 and 6 February 1981,
120,000 marijuana plants were destroyed."

The effective antinarcotics drive can be attributed to the leadership and guidance
of the ESP? and cooperation among the members of the armed forces, the people's
police force, members of the local party, council, mass and class organizations
and the people.

SBAHEN'S DRUG CONVICTION-More than three-quarters of the seamen suspended from
the seamen's register as a result of Section 40a of the Shipping and Seaman Act,
1952, have been convicted of drug-related offences. This informtion was given
in Parliament by the Associate Minister of Transport (Hr Malcolm) in reply to a
question by the member for East Coast Bays (Mr C. T. Knapp). The section under
which the suspensions were made was an amendment to the original act, passed in
1971 and which came into force in 1972. Under the amendment, seamen may he sus-
pended on several grounds, including bad conduct, offences against discipline,
desertion, endangering life or vessel, and conviction under the Narcotics Act

and the Customs Act. Hr Malcolm said that since the provision came into force,
223 suspensions had been made, of which 180 had been drug-related. Host of these
had related to the possession of drugs, seven were for the illegal importation of
drugs, and 30 for supplying drugs. The section, which had the backing of the
Seamen's Union, was "doing a great deal of good in cleaning up some sections of
the industry " Hr Bhlcolm said. [Text] [Christchurch THE PRESS in English

SHIPS CARRYING DRUGS TO EUROPB--Norrkoping (TT)--According to a Pakistani ship's
captain there is no Pakistani ship sailing in European waters that does not have
narcotics onboard. The captain told customs agents in Stavsnger that he recently
threwlSOkg of hashish in the ocean off the English coast. The captain said he
threw the drugs overboard on orders from the shipping company which had been
tipped off that there was hashish onboard the ship. On Tuesday customs agents in
Norrkoping found 3.7 kg of hashish and 1.2 kg of cannabis oil onboard another Paki-
stani ship. The confiscated drugs represented a value of “25,000 Swedish kronor
(627,000 Danish kroner). According to Lars Hidholm, Norrkoping customs chief.

it was suspected that the crew had thrown hashish into the ocean before the ship
arrived in Sweden. Lars Hidholm suspected the crew had traded hashish in Heat
Germany for expensive goods. "Since crews on the Pakistani ships are poorly paid
it is customary for them to earn extra income through trading hashish." said Lars
Uidholm. [Text] [Copenhagen ammcsxn 1mm: in Danish 27 Aug 81 p a] - 6518

[Text] Nags City, Aug. 14--The Camarines Sur Constabulary command raided the
other day a suspected New People's Army's (NPA) marijuana plantation in
Barangays Biglaye and Tinalmod, municipality of Pasacao.

The raiding team uprooted more than 1,000 full-grown marijuana plants with an
estimated value of P300,000.

Three suspected “PA weed cultivators were arrested by the PC team led by
Col. Wilfredo P. Villanueva, PC/INP provincial commander. They were identified
as Delfin Villarbar, 29, Pando Benitez and Antonio Paganusan, 30.

During the interview with the BULLETIN, the three suspects admitted that they
planted the marijuana in the area near their respective houses. They claimed
that the marijuana seeds were given to them by two NPA cormnnders who controlled
the area, whom they identified only as 'Vumander Sino" and "Kumander Moria."

The suspects added that Sino and Moria, together with their heavily armed

band numbering around 20, threatened to liquidate them if they will not plant
the marijuana seeds. They also said that the armed group continue to visit them

after they planted the seeds up to the time the plants are matured and ready
for harvest.

Col. Villanueva said that marijuana planting is fast becoming a very lucrative
source of income for the EPA in the province. The income, he said, that the

NPA derives out of the illegal planting of weeds is used to sustain the financial
needs of the subversive groups in the province.

The suspects are presently detained at the PC headquarters in this city. Villanueva
also ordered an all-out province-wide campaign against marijuana planting. (Roy

[Text] Admitting past failures in its substitute crop plan to wipe out cultiva-
tion among hilltribes in the north, the office of the Narcotics Control Board [KGB]
has adopted a new "coordinated" plan with operations concentrated in the basins of
eight rivers in the north where opium cultivation has been rampant.

The new 5-year comprehensive plan, to be put into effect in the new fiscal year
beginning Oct 1, 1981, blames past failures on the fact that most projects were
on a small-scale basis, which did not stop the hilltribes from moving their
opium fields to nearby sites. Past mistakes were also blamed on the lack of
coordination among government agencies concerned.

Under the new 5-year plan, according to informed sources in the NCB, development
plans to replace opium cultivation will be based in the basins of the following
main rivers: Mai Chaem; Mae Kok; Mae Taeng; Mae Ngat; Mae Chan; Nan; Lum Nan Pai and
Lum Nam Yoi Mae Ping.

"Unity, consistency and feasibility" will be the main thrust of the new opium
substitute plan, which will also call for participation by the private sector to
promote substitute crop cultivation.

The plan will be launched in the wake of a bumper opium crop this year—-a trend
which has raised concern among anti-narcotics officials. It has been estimated
that about 600 tons of opium may be produced from the "Golden Triangle" this year
due to favourable climate in the area.

The new plan will also attempt to promote productivity of substitute crops and to
stress agricultural systaa compatible to the hilltribes' lifestyle such as agro-
forestry.

"I‘he government will take steps to encourage the hilltribes to be loyal, both
legally and practically, towards Thailand. They will be given both rights and
responsibilities as Thai citizens," according to the plan.

The new plan will also try to avoid "duplication of work, confusion and budgetary

waste" in the various projects by conducting research work, coordination and
programs planning as well as evaluation of the development plan in earnest.

l9
The plan will place the sub-constittee on substitute crop cultivation and addictive
crop control as the body with the authority to resolve all problems related to
this development scheme, with other related government agencies serving as its
coordination points or field units.

The new plan will also provide alternative income sources for the hilltribes

who has traditionally been relying on opiun as their main economic crop. These
substitute schemes would include the cultivation of vegetables and other substitute
crops which offer high income; handicraft work; planting of coffee and pears

as well as tourism.

while primary education and public health services would be offered with greater
efficiency by the government, the plan will also improve the marketing side of
the products from the hilltribes.

ONCB CHIEF BACKS SUBSTITUTION PLAN; CONFLICTS NOTED
Bangkok THE NATION REVIER in English 1 Aug 81 p 5

[Article by Vithoon Pungprasert]

[Text] Secretary General of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (NCB).
Police Maj Gen Pow Sarasin, has defended the substitute cr0p programme in the
northern hills to phase out opiua cultivation as a reasonably successful project.

lie said in an interview with THE NATION that the United Nations had only recently
extended the agreement to help in the scheme, adding 40 more villages into the
programs, 'because the UN sees that the programme is heading towards the right
direction. "

Pow said that a German assistance programs for hilltribers will also comence
soon.

"Compared to ten years ago, the amount of opium cultivation now is very small
indeed. Ten years ago. the production was about 100 to 150 tons. Now, it has
gone down to about 48.57 tons. This shows a drop of. more than 50 per cent." he said.

Pow also reported that at 001 Salmnuen, Chiang Mai, the income of a hilltriber
had gone up from 40,000 baht to 60,000 baht this year from substitute crop. "We
expect the average income to go up to 90,000 baht per year for the hilltriber,"
he added.

The NCB secretary general contended that the problems arising from duplication of
work among government agencies "could be overcome."

"We have, for example, set up a special task force in the North to suppress opium
cultivation with provincial governors acting as the main coordinators of the
project," he said.

A meeting of the task force recently agreed to seriously wipe out opium cultivation
in ten areas in Chiang Mae alone.

"Re have picked the areas where the hilltribers have already managed to earn suffi-
cient income from substitute crops," Pow said.

21
Informed sources said that the “CB and the Office of the National Economic and
Social Development Board (NESDB) have been locked in a debate over the substitute
crop programme.

During a recent meeting between representatives fron the N63 and the 8303, the
proposal by the NCB to launch anti-opium operations in the basins of eight
rivers in the Rorth where opium had been rampant was discussed.

The NESDB wants the main thrust of the development plan in the next five years
to concentrate on absolutely poor areas. arguing that opium cultivation is only
one of the numerous social problem of the people in the remote and poor area.

The NESDB representatives also argued that the “63's proposed projects on eight
river basins would not be practical. The NESDB asked the NCB to propose the anti-
opium campaign on a province-by-province basis to fit in with the NBSDB's develop-
ment plan.

Sources said that the NCB representatives in the seeting counter-proposed that
the anti-opitn campaign could be reduced to concentrate on three river basins--
Mae Chan, Pai and Nan for which foreign aid agreenents had been signed.

"He will map out the substitute crop plans on a provincial basis for Chiang Mai,

Chiang Rai, Mae Hong Son, Nan and covering one tadon of Lampang as well." the
sources said.

Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 30 Aug 81 p 1

[Text] Hat Yai-Four drug smugglers were arrested carrying 11 kilogrammes of
morphine at Huang District bus station yesterday. police said.

The arrest followed a tip-off that there would be an attempt to smuggle narcotics
aboard an Udomrat Tour Company bus from Bangkok, for shipment across the border
into Malaysia.

Plainclothes narcotics agents led by Capt Samriang Sangachan were posted at the
Udomrat Tour office on Niphat-uthit 2 Road, to watch passengers get off the bus
from Bangkok.

They became suspiciOus of two men who got off carrying boxes of detergent. As
the two were about to get into a Toyota car. where another two men were waiting
for them, the officers moved in to arrest them.

Two men, identified later as Sa-nga Rattana-porn, 30, from Nakhom Ratchasima,
and Kamnueng Uilawan, 29, from Samut Prakan, were arrested immediately, police said.

The other two ran off. chased by the police. They were caught in Niphat-uthit 3
Road and ibentified later as Horawet Piriyayesyangkul. 36, and Hualiew sae Lee,
30. both from ﬂat Yai.

Police said they found eight blocks of Brand 999 morphine. weighing about
11 kilogramnes, in the Pao Boon Chin detergent boxes. The drug would be worth

DRUG OFFENSES INCREASE-dine than 50.000 charges of sinple possession of nari-
juana or hashish were placed by police last year, Statistics Canada reported
Thursday. The nuaber of cannabis offences increased 13.8 per cent to 66.685 in
1980, conpared with 56,834 the previous year. About 650 of the cannabis charges
were for importing or cultivating and about 9,500 were for trafficking. The rest
were for simple possession. The government has said it intends to shift cannabis

offences from the Narcotic Control Act to the Food and Drug Act and reduce penal-
ties to fines for possession. Statistics Canada said 1,706 cocaine offences were

reported last year. a leap of 69.2 per cent. Heroin offences rose 8.3 per cent
to 623. [Text] [Ottawa THE CITIZER in English 21 Aug 81 p 26]

BAIL FORFBITURES LEAVE POLICE WITH HUGE DRUG STORES
Nassau THE TRIBUNE in English 17 Aug 81 p 1
[Article by Dilette Thompson]

[Excerpts] In the wake of $269,000 being ordered forfeited to the Public Trea-
sury, it was revealed today that drug accused who jump bail are causing the po-
lice a problem with the huge amounts of marijuana seized.

Court Prosecutor Joseph Major today made an application to Magistrate Joseph
Alfred to make an order to "do something about the accumulation of drugs," a
problem which he said is caused by the nonappearance of foreigners charged with
possession of marijuana.

But Magistrate Alfred said that his hands are'tied as “my powers concerning drugs
disposal can only be exercised following the completion of a trial."

Absconding trial today were Martin Clarfield, 46, and Helen Hitchman, 32, of New
York. Both were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine on November 23,
1980.

And charged with possession of 27 bales of marijuana at Alice Town, Bimini, was
Angel Garcia, 43.

Today, a warrant was issued for his arrest and bail, set at $25,000 cash, was
ordered forfeited.

Americans Felix Martinez, 43, and Gustavo Gavitia, 35, charged with Cecilio Ramos
Carrion, 34, of Puerto Rico, forfeited bail totalling $105,000.

The three were charged with possession of marijuana with intent to supply at
Hilliams Island on July 28. They were also charged with possession of an un-
licensed Browning 9m automatic pistol and possession of two hundred 9m bullets
without a firearm certificate.

The defendants, further charged with possession of four semi-automatic carbine
rifles at Hilliams Island, were granted bail of $35,000 cash each.

And before Magistrate Shirhxﬁdun 12 Colombians, charged with possession of 172
bales of marijuana, did not appear for trial.

37
The men. represented by Nigel Bone, were arrested aboard the Ceja II, a 160—foot
boat seized by members of the was "Eleuthera" under the col-and of the Coman-
der Anthony Allen. The boat is said to be the largest boat ever seized by the
Defence Force.

Charged were Tranciado Forbes, 51, Juan Olivereros, 35, Pedro Arrieto, 37,
Iluninado Correa. 21, Oscar Romero, 1.0, Jesus Berrio, 32. Luis Berzara, 69,
Carlos aerrera, 23, Luis Poloncia, 26, Valentin Pertua, 2b, Jorge Cortes, 42,

TECHNOLOGY USED TO COUNTER DRUGS DESCRIBED
Piedras Negras EL DIARIO DE PIBDRAS NEGRAS in Spanish 19 Aug 81 Sec 8 p 3

[Text] Mexico City, 18 Aug 81 (NOTIMEx)--The contribution fron science and technology
to the battle against hallucinogenic substances of natural origin has. thanks to

the modern automatic electronic processing mechanisms, been a decisive factor making

it possible to distinguish between normal crops and poppy and narihuana plantations.

The electrooptical systems installed in the lower part of an aircraft provide the
"hallnark of distinction" of the drug plantations, because to detect then from

afar they nake use of infrared rays which record the gaunt of wavelengths reflected
by these plants. The systen is complex. but it can be sun-arised roughly as "infra-
red photography."

A study in this regard made by specialists free the National Council for Science and
Technology (CONACYT) has established that the geographical and climatological fea-
tures of Mexico have fostered the cultivation of large volules of poppies and sari-
huans, as well as the establishment of laboratories (albeit prinitive) for processing
these plants, fron which alkaloids such as opiun, morphine and heroin are obtained.

To prevent their proliferation, the Mexican authorities add, and to detect illegal
plantations of natural drugs. they have used resources ranging from trained dogs
Army detachments and special aircraft (associated with the Condor program) and others
to the inclusion of aircraft with the detection devices.

However, the problem of the planting and processing of drugs of natural origin is not
limited to this context. Also to be considered are aspects such as the clandestine
landing strips used by drug traffickers (nearly 2,000 in the Sinaloa naountains
alone), for which there are several aircraft available for detection.

The problem is decreasing gradually. The Gates Lear 35 A planes used by the Army
are provided with a pair of basic sensors, a photogrannetric camera, an optico—
mechanical scanner (produced especially by NASA) and a Liton 72 conputer, comprising
an inertial navigation system used to ascertain the location of the aircraft, as
well as possible laboratories and clandestine landing strips, in addition to what is
basic: the plantations.

Hence, great results are expected from technology and science in the battle against

natural drugs.

OFFICIALS ChARGED HIT“ ESCAPE 0P INHATBS EELEASED
Piedras Negras EL DIARIO DB PIEDRAS NEGRAS in Spanish 13 Aug 81 Sec D p 6

[Text] Yesterday afternoon, three of the five persons convicted of allowing prisoners
to escape were released, one was jailed for negligent homicide, something for which
action had been taken against him some time ago. and another was incarcerated for
having made the keys available, and is being held for trial.

They are former wardens and former police officers who were held for the escape of
inmates, when four dangerous drug traffickers escaped from prison, one of whom
offered a large sum of money on one occasion to avoid having his relatives investi-
gated.

The former policemen who were acquitted by the penal judge of the first instance,
Hector Pablo Aguilar Osuna, are Domingo Vazquez, a former warden, and Francisco
Ramirez and Antonio Roses, former policemen.

Both were on guard at the municipal prison when the four dangerous prisoners escaped,
including one named Ruben Ponseca, who was from Sinaloa and who had enough money to
buy anything; but this did not happen.

The incidents on that occasion occurred as follows. Ruben Fonseca and three other
inmates had paid for the construction of a tunnel for them, which would lead to
cell nine in the direction outside of the north side of the jail.

For this purpose, they took the key from Matias Puente to open the padlock on the
tunnel cell. They escaped through there at dawn, and it is certain that someone
was waiting for them in a vehicle within a short distance away.

On that occasion Domingo Vazquez was on guard as deputy warden, and Francisco
Ramirez, Antonio Roses and others were serving as guards; but it was only the
former who were arrested for allowing the inmates' escape.

It was they who searched the cell through which the innates escaped, a fact which
was reported to BL DIARIO at the time, which was nearly a year ago, because they
were held for 8 months.

Yesterday morning, the penal judge of the first instance, Hector Pablo Aguilar Osuna

acquitted then, leaving only Guadalupe Martinez held for trial to which he is
being brought for negligent homicide.

TRAPPICKBRS INVOLVED IN ESCAPE PROM DETENTIOﬂ CENTER

Nuevo Laredo EL HANANA in Spanish 26 Aug 81 Sec A p 2

[Text] Last night, a spectacular escape was staged at the Social Rehabilitation Center,
with two of the eight inmates taking part in the plan which dates back about 7 months
attaining their goal. Succeeding in their attempt were Noe Cuajsrdo, who was serving
an l8~month sentence for robbery, vagracy and bad behavior, and Agustin Duran Reyes,
with a 7-year sentence for a crime against health; whereas the perpetrator of the
escape, the dangerous murderer and drug trafficker, Pedro Torres Leon, was captured
inside the tunnel that led from his cell to Nine Street and Colima Avenue.

Federal Judicial Police Forces arrived at the Social Rehabilitation Center and took
away Torres Leon, an individual accused of a crias against health, hosicide and
damages to police agents in Durango, who is considered the main instigator of this
escape.

The preliminary investigations indicate that, 6 or 7 months ago, the digging began
on a tunnel slightly over 20 meters long and about 1 meter in diameter, leading
from Torres Leon's cell to Nine Street and Colima.

Last night, the investigators kept confidential several important points regarding
the manner in which the prison authorities found out about the spectacular escape,
when two of them had already succeeded in fleeing. But it is to be presumed that

the alarm came from among the inmates the-selves, who knew the intentions of those
seeking to obtain their freedom in this way.

Among others involved in this action are Leopoldo Zavala Salazar, an individual
sentenced to 7 years in prison for a crime against health; Francisco Rivera Quezada,
also jailed for a crime against health, serving sentences of 6 and 7 years, that is
13 years, respectively; and the brothers Jose and Sixto lbsrra Reyes who. like
Torres Leon, did not attain their goal.

Federal Judicial Police forces participated in the questioning on the incident, and
after 24 hours had not yet returned Torres Leon to his respective cell.

The head of the Social Rehabilitation Center, hector Garcia Trevino, told EL MANANA
that he was notified about the foregoing at 2100 hours, whereas a report had already
been given to all the public security forces attempting to capture the escapees.

[Text] Maxico City, 13 Aug (ANPB)-The second col-under of the Federal Judicial Police,
Margarito Mendez Rico, achieved a good entry in his dossier as a police officer upon
capturing three drug traffickers. one of whom was a former member of the State Judi-
cial Police in Nayarit, with 3 kilograms of opius gum worth over 100 million pesos

on the black market in their possession.

The arrests were made in the states of Jalisco and Neyarit, the first being that of
Andrea star Macias and Antonio Salazar Herrera, as they were transporting 2 kilo-
grama of opium gum which was intended to go to the United States.

Following the investigation, they arrested Refugio Torres Einojosa, who had served
in the Nayarit Judicial Police for several years, and who was dismissed when it
was proven that he had connections with the underworld. A kilogran of opium gum
was seized from this individual in ltlan, Rio de hayarit.

In Uruapan, Hichoacan, Oaxaca, Oaxaca and versoruz, four individuals who were carrying
830 kilograms of marihusna with then were arrested. The first blow struck was in
Uruapan, where marihuana was being taken to El Paso, Texas. They gave information
leading to the discovery of a plantation measuring 1,200 square meters, where 12,000
plants of that drug were found to have been planted.

In Oaxaca. a small plane with American registration was located, on which 500 kilo-
grams of marihuana were being shipped, and which had been abandoned by the drug
traffickers when they noticed the presence of the Mexican Army and Federal Judicial
Police.

Finally, in Veracruz, an arrest was made of Roberto Hernandez Boles and Alberto
hernandez Ruiz, who were carrying 30 kilograms of grass in a late model Dodge truck
with state of Veracruz license plates to the port, where they intended to sell it
to American tourists.

STUDY ON MOTIVATION 0P YOUTH T0 BEGIN TAKING DRUGS
Hamburg DER SPIEGEL in German 14 Sep 81 pp 58-61
[Irticle: "Stuff and Nonsense§7

[Text7 Cologne study refutes view that only
youthful outsiders are drug risks.

Bernd, 20, was "actually always king” or his clique. when "there
was nothing going on” he "made it happen." He left school after
the ninth form and then learned cabinetry, but only for a year.

The work did not "turn him on at all.”

In the Cologne woods, he smoked his first Joint with some friends
"Just out of curiosity" and then switched to LSD. Later on, only
heroin would do.

From time to time, he tried to kick the habit because "things
just couldn't go on this wayJ'But he didn't make it. Now, Bernd
is in Jail. In the end, he had to resort to theft and burglary
to get money to buy the stuff.

Bernd's day-to-day existence as a fixer and his career in drugs
are models cited in a study which presents a new aspect of the
drug abuse phenomenon.*

Three Cologne sociologists refute the generally accepted thesis
in this study according to which youthful outsiders are particu-
larly prone to drug abuse and that it is primarily economic dis-
tress that turns youngsters into Junkies. The study, however,
holds that "good and frequent relationships to persons of equal
age increase the danger of drug dependency."

The social scientists gathered their material in the mid-seventies
and between 1978 and 1980 in the largest Juvenile prison in North

Rhine-Westphalia at Siegburg, which houses male prisoners only.

52
0n the basis of 100 interviews -- the most extensive drug study
in the PRG so far-- the authors trace the path that can lead to
use and addiction.

According to their findings, many become junkies in a social
setting. They are curious as to the effect of drugs and try them
out in the company of friends. They know about the dangers of an
overdose but still think they can control their own drug consump-
tion. They live behind a glass wall and become impervious to the
plight of other drug addicts.

The Cologne team also found that the drug scene has changed. In
place of upper-class flower children, most drug users now come
from the lower strata. 70 percent are ninth graders and 30 per-
cent do not even have a diploma.

At home, things were pretty normal. Their garents were primarily
experienced as providers; alienation was t e order of the day.
In every other family, the parents were divorced or separated or
one of the parents had died. "I would rather discuss my problems
with my friends,“ one of the junkies said. I'I had the feeling
they understood me better."

Fear of school did not play a role; but disgust with school did.
Unemployment, difficulties in gaining admission to a university
tended to increase pessimism and resignation among young people
but were not decisive for increased drug consumption, according
to the Cologne study."More often it comes down to a kind of dif-
fuse curiosity," Cologne sociologist Herbert Ber er concluded,
that leads young peeple astray I thoua t I we d try it so as
not to make a fool of my selfy in front of all these people. It
was all stuff and nonsense about how it hurt you. They all looked
perfectly normal."

In most cases, addiction was a slow process. As a rule, the new
generation of Junkies does not start on heroin, either. By the

mid-seventies, 78 percent said they had started on hashish; by

1980, there were 98 percent who had. But things are rougher in

Berlin where one out pof five users starts off with heroin.

0n the hashish meadow in Frankfurt or at the zoo in Berlin, it
doesn't take them long to form the habit. 70 percent of all youth-
ful addicts, the Colognr study says, made use of "the very first
opportunity for drug consumption." Up to the age of 16, 80 percent
of those questioned had their first encounter with drugs mostly in

public parks and discothequee.

53
At first, most of them felt next to nothing. ''All of them were
turned on," one of the young people said, "and I was as sober as
a judge and had no idea what was what. But after the first 6
months, about a third used drugs once or several times a day.
One out of 20 on hashish soon turned to stronger stuff, mostly
to LSD; but one of, eight turned from hashish straight to heroin.

Girls, the Cologne study found, are often given shots by smart
dealers or pushers to get them into the habit and lead them on

to heroin; but among the boys sociologist Karl-Heinz Reuband dis-
covered nothing comparable.

Both in the case of initial drug use and the subsequent switch to
heroin, it is curiosity that does it. "All of my friends were
shooting up; Just a few were still smoking pot. 1 Just couldn't

. see it any more; so I tried out the stuff, too.“

Every other user still thought heroin was dangerous: but they were
going to be careful. 38 percent sniffed heroin which --erroneously--
is considered to be less of a danger. Sniffing has become stylish.
In 1974. only 8 percent of all heroin users sniffed the stuff.

All users were aware of the den er of an overdose. More than two-
thirds knew of Junkies who had ied of an overdose or of impure
drugs; whose "eyes had turned to zero," as the saying goes.

One out of three has himself seen someone die on a toilet or in
the gutter, but didn't care. "It was the others who were of no
concern to me. What consequences was I supposed to draw from it ?"

In the end, all of those questioned turned to crime. They stole on
order in department stores, snatched purses and some became pro-
stitutes. Others made a career of it inside the drug culture. One
youth, arrested for drug dealing, said: "If you go through that,
you've really lived." And some, Berger found, turn their worst
addictive phase into "heroic experiences like war veterans re-
counting their exploits."

HUGE HASHISH SEIZURE 0N SHIP IN BARI

Inadequate Drug Laws Decried
Bari LA GAZZBTTA DBL HEZZOGIORRO in Italian 27 Aug 81 pp 1, 2
[Article by Dionisio Ciccarese: ”Drug warfare on the High Seas")

[Excerpts] Proposal for inspections in international waters-
Cargo of arms suspected

"The investigation is not yet over, but we know that this is the biggest operation
in Europe in the war on the international traffic of hashish." These words were ad-
dressed by Colonel Angelo De Giacomo, commander of the Regional Nucleus of Fiscal
Police, to reporters asking for official news on the drug-laden ship sequestered in
the port of Bari.

Having answered their questions, De Giacomo offered additional information. "The
war on drugs," he sadd, 'nmst be waged on the high seas. 0n land it becomes dis-
persed into a thousand rivulets. Unfortunately, the present law prevents us from
making any serious attacks on the drug traffic. Our interventions in territorial
waters (within the 12~mile limit) are far from adequate. Therefore, we need a new
international law allowing specialized antidrug units to search suspicious vessels
in international waters. The New York convention, which regulates our activities
in this respect, does not permit us to do that, even though we have the men, the
means, and the capacity to combat the drug trade."

The ncws of the operation in Bari is not startling, although some details of the
episode have come to light. The "Lucas Sky“ (formerly known to the investigators
as the "Amali" and the "La Paloma" and suspected of illegally transporting arms and
automobiles stolen in Ravenna) flew the Spanish, not Lebanese. flag, as originally
reported. Aboard the ship the police found about 80 liters of hashish oil and
three tons and 300 kilos of hashish loaves. The wholesale value of the entire

cargo amoungs to over 3 billion lire, worth at least 30 billion on the retain
market.

No arms were found on the ship, but it is possible that the proceeds from the sale

of the drug could have been earmarked for the purchase of war material. ”or was
there a lifeboat, and a damaged crane was dangling over the port side. This fact

55
gives rise to two suppositions: (I) that another member of the crew (the real con-
mander?) had left the ship off Otranto, i.e., where an $06 was transnitted to report
the ship's notora out of order, or (2) that the crew, anxiOus about the conse-
quences of their call for help (police controls, inspections, and prerequisitions

in the port of Bari), might have concealed their most conpromising cargo-armaments-o
somewhere on the coast of Otranto.

The investigation is continuing: arms and persons involved in the illicit traffic
could still be in hiding on Italian soil. In any event, it is certain that the op-
eration will lead to wider developments, particularly on the international scale.
The investigators, convinced at first that the cargo was en route to a destination
somewhere in Italy (possibly the Marches or the coast of the Abruzzi), now believe

that the shipment night have been on its way to the French, Dutch, or German
narkets.

The "Lucas Sky," which definitely sailed from Beirut. is the property of two part-
ners, Adel N. Zidan (ship builder, who owns 66.66 percent of the vessel) and Jose

Louis Dennis (who owns 33.33 percent). Both men live at the same address in
Beirut, Via 2 Verdon Inn. Naouli.

The six crew nenbers, for whom Dr. Leonard Rinella has issued warrants of arrest,
are charged with trafficking in drugs and abetting a crime. Moreover, they are
accused of an irregularity in flying the Spanish flag when the ship, in fact, is
Lebanese. The "com-ander," Diego Superina, is also charged with carrying a false
passport.

Suspicious Ship Searched
Naples IL MATTINO in Italian 27 Aug 81 p 5
(Article: "It Has Carrying Drugs worth 30 Billion")

[Text] The 108 jute sacks, each containing about 60 loaves of hashish weighing
600-500 grams, and the four plastic containers of hashish oil were discovered in
the forward hold of the "Lucas Sky," the entrance of which was hidden behind chains
and other naval equip-ant. "He were suspicious about the ship from the very be-
ginning," said De Giacomo, "even before it was towed to Bari because of the danage
to its notors. It was drifting helplessly in the Otranto Channel, with a damaged
crane hanging over its side. Hhan military units of the Otranto Maritime Dele-
gation (in Lecce) reached it. they noted that there was no lifeboat abroad. More-
over, it was flying the Spanish flag.

"The ship had moved," the officer went on, "but then the crew asked for a tugboat
because evidently it was in no condition to navigate by itself. In Dari, it
turned out that the crew nenbers' docunents were not in order, so we investigated.
He knew about the 'Lucas Sky' because of its contraband activities."

"A verification of the identity of the presumed colmander, Diego Superina, 26, of
Milan, showed that he had falsified his passport, and this confirmed grounds for

his arrest. But the matter did not end there. He collected further evidence and,
with the consent of the Attorney General of the Republic, conpleted our inspection

56
of the ship. which led to the discovery of the drug cargo. Also, the identity of
the other crew mabersuciuseppe Savino, 32, of Forenaa (Potenaa); Houaaa nalki
Mousse, 25, Lebanese; Youssef Hanna Found, 31, ubanese; Georges Boutros Sanir,
26. Lebanese; and Jellou Daoud, 55, Turkish. all of then arreated-spurred us to
extend our investigation."

Savino has been condemned several times for crimes against the country. Superina
was arrested in Trieste in 1979 for selling heroin to a drug addict, vho subse-
quently died. He is certainly not the commander of the ship. The captain, cone of
whose personal effects were found on board, might have left the "Incas Sky" when

it use immobilized in the Otranto Channel, which would explain the disappearance of
the lifeboat; he could be another Lebanese. It is thought that Superim. himself

a drug addict, could have been the "connection” with the consignee of the cargo.

All six men of the "Lucas Sky" have been indicted for trafficking in drugs, abetting
a crime. and flying the Spanish flag against regulations.
