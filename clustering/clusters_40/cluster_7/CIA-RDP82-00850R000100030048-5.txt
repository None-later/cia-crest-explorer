REPORT DISCUSSBS CRIME, DRUG USE RELATIONSHIP

Melbourne THE A63 in Bnglish 11 Jan 79 p 9
[Article by Ted Cavey]

[Text] The eagerly awaited report by the Australian Institute of Crim-
inology into the relationship between crime and drug use has been com-
pleted and released virtually unnoticed.

This is mainly because the report. by crininologist Dr. Grant Hardlaw,
concludes. after investigating the criminal histories of more then a
thousand convicted drug offenders in Australia, that there is no way of
accurately determining the amount of crime cosmitted by drug users to

finance their habits .

Dr. Hardlav warns. in fact. that estimates of the amount of drug-related
crime in Australia should be treated with caution.

And he found no reliable evidence to indicate that drug users co-it
crimes of violence as a direct consequence of the pharmacological action
of the drugs they consume.

Further. his investigations showed that a substantial percentage of
people arrested for narcotic drug offences had criminal histories before
their first arrest for a drug offence.

The study found that in Australia 66.81 per cent of users of expensive/
addictive drugs had been previously convicted for non-drug offences com-
pared with between 55 and 85 per cent in the United States.

Dr. Hardlaw estimates that between 30 to 60 per cent of income spent on
drugs is earned from non-drug revenue-producing crime but not all of this
from crimes against property. Cowling offences and prostitution featured
heavily in the criminal histories of a large nuder of drug offenders.

Hie report found that probably between 30 and 50 per cent of the income
needed to support large drug habits is generated within the drug distribu-
tion network itself—by buying and selling illegal drugs.
And evidence indicated that a significant nuiaar of heavy users of
expensive drugs obtained substantial financial support free fanily, wel-
fare and ewloynent.

The report refutes the proposition that legal heroin supply systems be set
up in Australia to stem the growth of illegal trafficking.

"Legal distribution systems are not likely to be structured in such a way
that the illegal supply system will become redundant and disappear." the
report says. "To the extent that the illegal narkat continues to operate,

the effectiveness of the legal system as a controlling agent will be
dininishe ."

The report adds: "It is also probable that a legal supply systee would
increase the absolute demand for heroin."

However. it establishes that volume and price of illegally supplied heroin
can be significantly affected by law enforcement. (The Victoria Police
Drug Bureau announced recently it was concentrating heavily on slashing
heroin trafficking rings in Melbourne.)

The report said that the nest effective strategies to this and are likely
to be the reduction of bribery and concentration on tight markets.

The report taco-sends the setting up of a data collection systen under
which police comissionere could monitor prices and purity of narcotics
illicitly sold throughout the country.

It also race-needs that the police con-issionere take whatever steps are
necessary to establish and naintain a heroin-user crime index modelled on
a similar one set up in the United States by the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration.

It also urges that police commissioners take the lead in initiating a
thorough analysis of drug policies in Australia with the sin of setting
attainable. realistic goals in drug enforcenent.

And it reco-ends that the police co-Iissionere sponsor—either directly or
through a grant-avarding body such an the Crininology Research Council-
an intensive study of the heroin distribution eyeten in a najor Australian
city-preferably Sydney.

EXPERT ESTIMATES WEEKLY REROIN IHPORTATION IS 23 KG
Perth THE BEST AUSTRALIAN in English 15 Jan 79

[Text] Sydney: An average of 23kg of heroin is being smuggled into
Australia each week, it has been claimed.

This estimate of Australia's appetite for heroin has been eade by an
expert on the South-East Asian drug scene, University of NS" lecturer
Dr Alfred McCoy.

An American who has lived ﬁIAuetralia for 18 months. Dr McCoy has studied
Australia's heroin problen--snd he paints a disturbing picture.

Re estimates that there are 40,000 drug addicts in Australia and that
their annual heroin consumption is 1.2 tonnes.

"In eoney terms, that comes to an on-street income for the dealers of
$300 million a year." Dr McCoy said.

"How can a trade of that size and involving that amount of money possibly
exist without organised cri-e, and what's more, an organised crime capable
of securing the police, political and judicial protection it needs to
survive?"

Dr McCoy is not the first to ask that question. Three royal conieeions
into drugs are supposed to be asking the same thing but he says there is
scant evidence they are even looking in that direction.

He expressed particular criticism at the royal cosmission syeteu. which
has no power of prosecution.

Dr McCoy's research has raised allegations of organised crime involve-ant
in the Australian heroin traffic and allegations of official corruption
and protection.

MALAYSIAN COURT PRBES AUSTRALIAN
Canberra THE AUSTRALIAN in English 19 Feb 79 p 10

[Text] A Malaysian court yesterday acquitted an Australian. Rosa Anthony
Cribb. 21. on a charge of trafficking in 10,616 kg of cannabis.

he had been in Alor Star Prison in north Malaysia for 13 months and faced
the possibility. if found guilty, of a death sentence of a ainiaun of
lb years‘ jail and a whipping.

Mr Justice Syed Agil Barskbah ruled in a lengthy reserved judgment yes-
terday--a nor-a1 working day in north Malaysia--that Cribb had had no
idea 49 packets of cannabis were concealed inside a stereo tuner and tape
deck he had carried across the border fro: Thailand.

He is the first of eight Australians now in Malaysian jails on traffick-
ing charges to be acquitted.

Acquittals are rare in Malaysia. where the prosecution has the advantage
of legal presumption of guilt if it can prove the defendant possesses
more than 100 gm of heroin or 200 gn of cannabis.

Cribb will have to remain inthecountry for the 10-day period during
which the prosecution can lodge an appeal against the verdict. There
was no sign yesterday whether an appeal would be lodged.

During his 6-1/2 day trial last week Cribb said he had carried the sets
into Malaysia for the father of his Thai girlfriend.

Customs officers told the court they becaae auspicious at the Cangloon
checkpoint when Cribb told than he intended to take the sets to Australia
by way of Malaysia and Singapore.

"is girlfriend’s father had wanted him to take the equipment to a man in
Penang and he had lied to the customs officers to avoid paying duty.

The judge said Cribb's counsel, Mr Choe Kuan. had successfully argued
his innocence.

l6
After thsfverdict. Cribb eebraced Hr Choe saying: "You have been a
second tether to ne.“

Cribb's'psrents. who had travelled tron Evans head. NS", were delighted
with the verdict, '11s are the happiest parents in Australia." Cribb'a
Esther said.

After slaning his release papers Hr Cribb went to have a beer and steak
to celebrate, but left four other Australians inside Alor Star jail on

similar charges.

The of these have already been sentenced to life imprisonment-9hich in
Malaysia scene 15 years after reuissions and a whipping.

Prison Director Denies Involve-ant

Jakarta moo in Indonesian 27 Jan 79 pp 16, 18

.- [Text] I Putu Benun will be sentenced this week. The foraer Denpasar
1(Beli) prison director nay be freed or jailed ”to replace” the two convicts
who escaped from the prison he supervised. Judge Sof Larosa. chief of the
Court of First Instance in Denpasar presided over the council of judges
to deternina the extent of responsibility of the prison director in connec-
tion with the two aliens. Donald and David. who escaped froa his prison
and fled the country.

This interesting story began 2 years ago. According to official records.
during a flight from Singapore to Port Noreshy. captain pilot Donald Andrew
Ahern. alias Donald Tait. 68 years. a British subject. landed his plane at
Ngurah Rai airport in Bali for a stopover on 9 August 1976. lie was accos-
panied by flight engineer David Allan Riffs. 36. a 0.8. citizen. Accord-
ing to custoaa officials. although it was only a stopover. they were not
free from surveillance. Horeover. it appeared to the custoas officials
that Donald parked his Cessna away fro: the officials on purpose.

The custom officers were right. "hen they raided the aircraft. they con-
firmed their suspicion. Nenty bags of nsrihuana weighing 666.10 kilograas
were found and taken out of the aircraft along with hundreds of handicrafts
and paintings. The custons people were so successful that the Indonesian
finance ninister awarded thee certificates of nsrit and Ionay for arresting
Donald and David.

In February 1977 Donald was handed a 17-year prison sentence and was fined
20 aillion rupiahs. Donald received a 7-year jail sentence plus a 20 nil-
lion rupiah fine. The presiding Judge Laroae ruled that both defendants
could not he found guilty of subversion because they did not unload and
snuggle in their goods here. they were only in transit.

The prison in Denpaaar when- Donald and David were to undergo their punish-
nent gave these foreign convicts special treatment. Donald was given a

20
special room. Recently Director General of Correctional Facilities lbnu
Susanto said that the special rooo turned out to be located outside the

prison walla. It was located amidst the housing complex of prison offi-
cials and was beyond the reach of the prison guards at the prison tower.

fhe laxity of security guard gave the foreign prisoner the impression

that he was free from surveillance. Donald was also givou privileges which
were somewhat excessive. he was allowed to go in and out of his special
room whenever he wished. he could freely eat in restaurants. go shopping.
make overseas calls from the telephone office and even go on picnics to
Sanur. Kute. Gianysr or Beeekih. his prison work was easy. teaching de-

pendents of prison officials English. He could even have fellow inmates
do his laundry.

inmate Donels was also permitted to open an account at a local hank. it
was approved and cleared in writing by the prison director. I Putu nenum
himself. He cashed checks several tines without being questioned, or at
least reported to higher authorities to determine the source of his large

sum of money. since the money in his possession had been seized by the
court.

David did not suffer in the prison either. He was transferred from Denpaaar
prison to Aoplapurs prison in Karangasem. The official fhorv. " ”0507‘
dinate of the prison director in Denpasar. was cautioned by Pete Benum

to take good care of David. He did. Like his fellow inmate Donald. Da-

vid was free to go in and out of his place of confinement. his duties were
only to repair the rice polishing machine belonging to the prison.

The freedom of movement and privileges given to these prisoners who cot-it-
ted a serious crime. classified in the B 1 category. were outrageous. Even
the police commander of Susetenggsre Province reminded l Puts Denum on

18 May 1977 that Donald was a convict involved in a narcotics case con-
trolled hy an international syndicate under government investigation.

Donald and David did pe‘ have tr 3. T . .Zci. release Very long. The
prisons in which they were never really confined were occupied by then
only five months. Pntu Benun left for Pain on 9 July 1977 reportedly on

An inheritance business. The following day Denpasar prison officials found
Dnnuld missing. while the Amplapura prison was deserted by David.

At first people only searched for then around Bali. When Donald and David
reached an undetermined place. the prisons issued "wanted" notices on ll July
I976 for their arrest. it was in vain.

“he is responsible? Putu Benun had an alibi he considered strong enough:
he was not at his duty station when Donald and David escaped. He felt. as
he pointed out in his defense later. that the prison guards on duty
should have been held responsible. However. the Regional Special Law En-
forcement Agency. the military and state police consistently accused him
of involvement in the escape. Since last October Judge Sof Laroaa has pre-
sided over Putu Benum's trial. The prosecutor accused Benum of committing

subversive acts. of deliberately releasing convicts in drug-related crimi-
nal acts.

Generally speaking. testimonies from the witnesses incriminated Dcnul. For
example. Soeroso Hardiwinoto. security chief of Denpaaar prison. was as-
signed by lenum to type the affidavit in support of Donald's application to
open a bank account. Bcnun himself wrote the draft of the letter. Soerosa
said he had reminded his superior that such an action was out of the or-
dinary. however. Soeroso himself was finally made to cash Donald's check
for 205,000 rupiahs. Hhat for? To build a hospital and a dispensary.
Ibrahim Ali's testinony. according to the prosecutor. also incriminated the
defendant. He said his superior urged him to take Donald from behind the
prison walls and to place him in n special room. "How about the police
commander's warning?" Ali said that Benum casually replied 'That's our in-
ternal probles." l Nyomau Susanto. the Amplapura prison chief. also gave
special treatment to David because he was so advised by his superior.

Putu Benum was not found guilty of being involved in the narcotics case.
”We lust frankly sdsit that" said the prosecutor. withdrawing his charges.
however. his actions brought about serious consequences; a series of his
acts damaged or undermined the integrity of the government. a subversive
set. For that crime. on 30 November 1978 Prosecutor I Gusti hgurah Alit
demanded a 5-year prison sentence for Benun.

Benus's defense itself was very interesting. He asked whether his trip to
Palu resulted in Donald's and David's escape. "is absence. he said. was
approved of by the regional chief of the Directorate General of Correc-
tional Facilities. his superior. also everything involving his work had
been relinquished to his subordinate in an official meaorandum. ”That
transfer did not involve any limitation or reduction in authority at all."
That included authority over the supervision of prisoners. Therefore. his
absence did not reduce the effectiveness of the security department he
left behind. Putu Ienum maintained he had sufficient reasons to be free
of all the changes. It was the guards and security agents that should
have been held responsible for Donald's and David's escape.

The assign-ant of a prisoner to a s;eciel room was not unusual and did not
apply to Donald alone. Before him. even before Putu Denum became the pri-
son director at Denpasar. many prisoners had been placed there. As for
Donald's freedom to go in and out of the prison. it was the responsibility
of his subordinate. the chief of the security department.

Denum's defense lawyer. Azhnr schnad of Jakarta. contended that the charges
against his client were nothing but an attenpt to find a scapegoat. No
matter how successful Donald and David were is escaping from the prison.

in leaving Dali and in fleeing the country. there should certainly be sole-

ons to blame. ﬂhy should Putu Denum be blamed. when he was away at the time
the prisoners escaped?

22
Donald's and David's escape. according to the defense attorney. involved
negligence on the part of all the security agencies in Bali. For instance.
Asher charged. if surveillance by iemigration authorities had been tight.
Donald and David would not have been able to flee the country through a

government-controlled airport. Let Judge Larosa consider and decide the

Pugitives Escaped by Air
Jakarta TEMPO in Indonesian 27 Jan 79 p 17

[Text] David Riffe is presumably living in Amsterdam now. HoweVer. the
adventure of Donald Andrew Ahern. the pilot. can be traced easily. he
rejoined his syndicate following his escape from Indonesia. "is assignment
remained unchanged. to fly a small plane here and there to smuggle drugs.
The last time. in february of last year. he flew over Australia. Neither
his point of departure nor his destination was disclosed. however. the

radar screen at Darwin spotted him. Donald tried to escape but he was
soon tailed by an RAAF Hercules.

Donald ignored the warnings issued by the hercules. He even eluded the
RAAF aircraft skillfully. and it was not until 26 hours later that it was
learned that Donald had made an emergency landing on a runway southeast

of Darwin. The landing was so unsatisfactory that he and his companion.
Hichael Leonard Bartley. were captured.

During investigation by Australian police Donald told them how he had es-
caped from Indonesia. as follows. A week after Donald was sentenced by
Lerosa and imprisoned. he was contacted by two foreigners. He did not die-
close their names but they came on orders from someone he knew in Bangkok
named George. They only brought a brief message: everything had been ta-
ken care of and subsequent contacts would be arranged shortly thereafter.

"hat "had been taken care of" was not clear. but several days after the
two foreigners' visit. Donald and David received better treatment. Donald
was placed in a special room. while David was transferred to Karangssem.
Subsequently. both received special treatment. Ten days later the same
people returned to the prison to visit Donald. This time they gave him
[.000 u.s. dollars. They promised to give him more if he indicated his
willingness to remain here. Donald said he would share the money with
David. Besides. Donald said. he would not leave Indonesia without David.

Donald secretly kept a New Zealand passport in the name of Peter Arthur
Jones which for unknown reasons remained in his possession. Donald reques-
ted that several documents be provided for David at Karangssem.

Several days before his escape. the same visitors came to see Donald. Ap-
parently it was their last contact. because everything was in order. es
were the documents for David.
Their eecape from prieon preaented no problea. eince they could go in and
out freely. On 10 July 1977 Donald purchaeed a Garuda ticket and et 10 p-
Hr Jonee departed froa Ngurah nai to Jakarta without any probloa. The
following day he eecaped the attention of iu-dgration officiale at halia
airport and flew to Singapore. There he let David who euccecded in ac-

quiring a plane ticket to fly directly froa Denpaeer to Singapore on the
eaae day.

During the inventigation Donald ineieted he did not note any preparationa

to eecape froa lndonaeia. Everything had been arranged free abroad. 0n

J Hay 1978 Donald and Bartley were aentenced by the Darwin court. They

were eentanced to 6 yeare and d aonthe and 3 yeare and B nonthe. reepactively.
Proa hie jail cell in Auatrnlia Donald apparently learned of the fate of

Pete Denna. the director of the prieon at Denpaear who had taken good care

of hin. Donald recently wrote a letter to one of the officiale in Bali to
help Putu Denna in hie caee.

In hie letter Donald explained how he left the prieon and fled to Singapore
by dieguieing hieeelf ea a bearded and beepectacled old nan. "e eaid he
and Davie excaped fron Indonesia without the help fro. any Indoneeian.

They were helped by their friends from outeide lndoneeia. Donald eaid

that while in Bali he never gave any aoney or anything to the prieon direc-
tor. ﬂie epeciel rooe aaidet Putu lenun'e faaily which functioned ae hie
cell waa given hie merely becauee he taught Bnglieh to prieon officiele.

He aleo eaid he did give noney to a governaent official who told hi- how to
eecape fron Bali. However. Donald did not heed that official becauee. in
addition to demanding nore aoney. he refused to help David.

Donald had hie own reaeone to eecape. Piret becauee he wee urged to help
David eecape. Secondly. while he wee in prieon. hie feaily wee conetantly
preeeured by the narcotice eyndicate. However. Donald pronieed he would
return to Indonesia and would aek the preeident for cleaency. According to
police recorde Donald wee not n newcoaar in criminal caaee. He wee in

Selangor KIN KHOK DAILY NEWS in Chinese 27 Jan 79 p 3

[l‘ex57 Kusla Lumpur 26 Jan-~In its positive anti-narcotics action. the
Customs bureau seized a. total of 1016.665 grams, or 41’. kilograms of various
narcotic drugs in 1978. The market value of these illicit drugs is estimated
at more than $10 million in Malay currency.

Na-tu-sh-tu-la-xin, Inspector General of the Royal Customs Bureau told

reporters today that his bureau has broken a number of major cases of inter-
national dope trafficking in coordination with the law enforcement organizations
of the member nations of the Council of Customs Cooperation.

The drugs seized by customs officers last year included 339.000 grams of
raw opium, 8,900 grams of processed opium, 56,000 grams of marihusna,
39,611 grams of marihuana plants, 5,500 grams of morphine. 365 grams of
residual opium. and 6,900 grams of heroin.

Na-tu-ah—tu-la-xin said that in the first 11 months of 1978, 600 persons

were prosecuted for narcotics trafficking, and were fined a total of
$2.8 million.

During the same period. the customs bureau also issued 5,400 sumons and
received $1.6 million in fines.

In addition. the customs also seized 190 vehicles with a total value of
$2 million.

Na-tu-ah-tu-la-xin also disclosed that among other sundry seizures were
$6.5 million of jewelry, cosmetics and wrist watches.

The smuggling detection group achieved outstanding results in prohibiting
illegal brewing. it seized 407,000 liters of liquor, 26.000 liters of wine
and 900 liters of cocosnut flower wine.

Nn-tu-ah-tu-la-xin. said that the customs bureau was especially successful
in policing smuggling, tax evasion and trafficking in contraband.

He said that public reaction to the bureau's achievements is very encouraging.

11
No-tu-ah-tu-la-xin indicated that the intelligence infornetion received fro-
the public haa been highly accurate. and each infornation haa often enabled
cuetone officers to pureue Iany caaea to aucceeeful conclusione.

ESTABLISRHENT 0F DRUG HITHDRAHAL CENTERS SUGGESTED
Senlangor KIN KHOK DAILY NEHS in Chinese 22 Jan 79 p 3

[Tesé7 Kuala Lumpur 21 an--All major hospitals are urged to establish

narcotic withdrawal centers to monitor and analyze the hazard of narcotics
to the human body.

Hhile making this suggestion. Chen Zujo. Director of the Greater Malaysia
Pharmaceutical Association. pointed out that the data collected by these
centers will clearly indicate the hazard of certain drugs to local residents.

The accumulation of this data will help health authorities classify drugs
and determine which drugs should be prohibited or restricted.

According to Hr Chen. all narcotic drugs are harmful to patients. It is
only a matter of degree. he said.

Mr Chen said that New Zealand has a state narcotics observation center.
All hospitals. clinics, and private doctors in New Zealand must report to
the center the harm caused by any kind of narcotic drug they come across.

He thinks that this kind of observation center can also be established in

Malaysia. At the beginning. such centers may be established in major
hospitals. then extened to smaller hospitals and private health clinics.

MARINANA CONCEALED IN LP RECORD ENVELOPBS
Montreal LA PRESS}: in French 9 Feb 79 p A 3

[Text] The curiosity of a customs officer per-itted the RHCP [Royal Mounted
Canadian Police] to put an end to the activities of a group of traffickers
who ieported narihuana in LP record envelopes. At the ties of their arrest
they were in the process of putting on the market cone 350 pounds of this
hallucinatory substance, valued at about $225,000.

Pour persons, of win three are women, have been apprehended so for in
connection with this utter. They are Herleen McLean Riley, 32 years old,
Denise Fey Swine, 24 years old, Cecilia harrison, 63 years old end cerle
Johnson. 33 years old, all of Janeican origin but residing in Hontrsal.

The federal police has also issued warrants of arrest for two other were
of this sans, the brothers Denis and Uinston McDonald; 29 and 32 years old
respectively. Once arrested, these two, like the other four accused
persons, will be charged in the Criminal Court of Saint-Jero-e with import-
ing narcotics and conspiring to put Inerihuana valued at $225,000 into
circulation.

This drug, which originated in Jamaica, had been shipped to lbntreel by
airplane, consigned to the Riley Funky llot Records Store, 6459 Victoria
Street, in the mtreuont section, owned by the husband of one of the young
women indicted.

According to an RCMP officer, to outwit any inspection the smugglers had
conceived the ingenious idea of cannuflaging the cannabis in LP record
albums, being extremely careful to press then fir-1y together beforehand
in order that they would take the shape of a 33 LP record.

However, the searching eye of a Hirabel custons officer led to the
discovery of the "narihuana records" in the course of a routine inspection
on Honday afternoon. As soon as the police officers of the narcotic
brigade stationed in Saint-Jeroue and Montreal were alerted, they assured
the surveillance of the three boxes containing the LP records.

60
Half a day later the employees of a trucking firm arrived at the airport
warehouse to pick up the merchandise and deliver it to the record dealer
on Victoria Street. where the federal investigators suddenly rushed in
early yesterday afternoon and apprehended the first four suspects.

At the same time, the police officers working under the orders of Sergeant
Gilles Genest and Corporal Robert Perrin seized 1,200 record envelopes.
in which between 190 and 235 grams each of marihuana were concealed.

According to Inspector Gilles Favreau, in charge of the narcotics brigade,
the importance of this haul is not due to the quantity of stock confiscated,
but rather because it put an end to the operations of a group of very well-
organized individuals “who,“ as he mentioned, "were surely not on their
first job in this type of trafficking.”

 

As demonstrated by Sgt [sic] Robert Perrin of the RCMP station in Saint-
Jerome. the traffickers had camouflaged the "marihusna leaves" in LP record

envelopes.

JAIL. $500,000 FINE IN DRUGS CASB-Toronto (AAP-REUTER)--An Indian mil-
lionaire was jailed yesterday for 16 years and fined about $500,000 for
conspiring to import into Canada more than half a tonne of hashish. It
was the largest fine ever imposed on an individual in Canada. Curdev
Singh Sangha. 69. had been extradited from Belgium and had pleaded guilty.
A statement of facts read out in court depicted him as a mastermind of an
international drug am.egling ring spanning India. Europe and North America.
Sangha organised shipments to Canada of hashish hidden inside bolts of
fabric. the court was told. Sangha holds a doctorate in laser technology.
he wrote his thesis in 1971 while serving a five-year term in a British
jail for drug trafficking. [Text] [Brisbane THE COURIER-MAIL in English

ALBERTA DRUG ENFORCEMENT STATISTICS--The law against possession of mari-
juana was being enforced in Alberta with more vigor than in any other
Canadian province in 1977. Statistics Canada reported Thursday. More
than twice as many drug charges were placed in Calgary as in Montreal
that year. And Alberta's OLlll. RCMP-patrolled coammmities mostly had
high drug offence counts. A total of 9.673 cannabis-which includes
marijuana. hashish and hashish oil--charges were placed in Alberta in
1977. Alberta's rate of charges per 100,000 population--672.6-was more
than twice the Canadian rate of 215.3. Statistics Canada noted that the
number of drug offences reported. as with prostitution and gambling.

probably indicates "the degree of enforcement rather than the measure of
the extent of the problem." It added that drug offence figures for

DRUG SITUATIO” IN INTERIOR 0F 8A0 PAULO SURVEYBD

Extent of the Problem
Sao Paulo 0 ESTADO D! SAD PAULO in Portuguese 20 Jan 79 p 34
[Article by Renato Lombardi]

[Text] Twenty-seven towns. about 80,000 addicts. From Sao Jose dos Campos
to Preaidente Prudente. the drug tratfickers, hundreds at then. sell more
than 30 kilograms of cocaine. 500 kilograms of marijuana. thousands of
Pervitin capsules and Desbutal, Hendrix and LSD tablets every month. These
in charge of drug sales are linked vith gangs in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro.
Paraguay, Peru and Bolivia.

This is the tragic truth--drugs have practically taken over the interior
of Seo Paulo. In Campinas, and this is just one example. the number of
addicts is estimated at 35.000.

Every day the drug traffickers find new ways of distributing their wares.
They use cars, trucks, and trains, and they are not choosy about places

to sell the drugs. Anywhere will do: clubs, diacothequas, bars. gas
stations. universities. luxury hotels, etc. And the techniques for
transporting drugs becone ever more inventive: an ordinary passenger on

a bus, asked to deliver something as a favor, may be caught with a suitcase
full of drugs. An automobile can conceal a shipment of narijuana, a
quantity of tablets or several kilograms of cocaine.

In a study to alert the public and the authorities, 0 ESTADO is reporting
on the main localities in the interior where drugs are sold and those
responsible for the delivery of the drugs.

"For years I felt as if I were dead. I constantly said to myself, 'well,
my God, what an I doing in this world? I shouldn't let them do this to
me. I'm just a consumer object, a living being who has no life.'"

a town near Pedro Juan Caballero. where they traded a Volkawagen for
marijuana. Everything had been arranged. A dmg trafficker known aa
"Paraguaio," who euppliee many towna in the interior, wae euppoeed to

wait for them in a hotel owned by e Lebenaae. But at the appointed day

and hour, two Braziliane appeared and took them to the Amambay quarter, on
the Paraguayan eide. and in a little dirt alleyway they were told to get
out and run. becauee they were to die.

"One of my companione use chat in the leg. He managed to get away from
the gunmen but were captured by the Paraguayan army. we lost the car. and
our familiee paid a great deal of money to one Colonel Hiranda. comander
of the detachment in Pedro Juan. for our releaee." 8. explained that the
frontier ie very dangeroua and that "then who are not part of the plan

will not get out of Paraguay with marijuana or barbituratee. and their very
liver are in danger."

Harijuana from Paraguay

Paraguay. According to the federal police. more than a ton of the "weed"

eacape control, the drug traffickere vary their routee and prefer to return
to the towna in the interior to cell their goode inetead of "calling when
they return from the neighboring country." The majority of contecte with
a view to the purchaee and eale of marijuana are made in a bazaar on

Dorthier Bacollar

Derthier Iaceller is regarded as one of the chief cocaine traffickers in

the country and the leading distributor in See Paulo. He was sought (or
years by the drug division of the DElc [Criminal Investigation Department],
and was finally arrested after an investigation which lasted almost four
years. Police agent "Larinho." currently assigned to the operations

sector of the DECRAN, heard talk of Darthiar while he was working in
Campinas. This drug trafficker was supplying cocaine for a large proportion
of the drug addicts in that city.

Derthier's name was heard for the first time at the Campinas police head-
quarters on a November 1955. in the course of the interrogation of customs
broker Luis Antonio Del Nero Pires. The police established a link between
society youths and drug traffickers. and Luis Antonio made a statement to
police chief Joaquin Campos Nogueirs to the effect that the son of a hotel
chain owner in Campinas bought drugs from Derthier and that the meetings to
exchange the drug occurred in hotels near the city limits.

Another place where Berthier delivered drugs was the lnce Bakery, in the
Nova Campinas quarter, which at the time wsa a hangout for minors. The
customs broker further said that this drug traificker traveled every two
weeks or so to Campinas, and he continued to do so until the month of
December 1978. when he was arrested in Rio. selling cocaine to None 0..
Alfredo V. A.. Saulo D., Nero P. u.. and Li: da C. X. From that day on
the Campinas police sought to apprehend Berthisr, but knowing of the visit
paid by Luis Antonio Del Nero Pires to the police headquarters. that indi-
vidual began to distribute the drug through a woman, who continues even
today to distribute cocaine in Campinas, Piraeicaba and Sorocaba.

In December of last year, the police investigator, "Lezinho," learned that
Derthier Bacallar had traveled to Peru in search of cocaine. Through the
records of a purchase of a car, a Maverick, in Campinas. the police were
able to learn the name of the bank where the drug trafficker had an account.
in the Leblon quarter of Rio de Janeiro, and also where Berthier lived. On
29 December, two police agents. Angerami and Nelle ciongo, and the police
investigator went to Rio. At the address where the drug trafficker lived.
they learned that he had moved the same day he returned from his trip.
after giving furniture. a television set, refrigerator and carpets to the
neighbors and the janitor.

The Sao Paulo policemen went to the bank branch and found Derthier Dacellsr

talking with the manager. The drug trafficker showed no reaction. Angerami
warned the guards of the dangerous nature of the well-dressed man who had,

52
just a few days previously, presented each bank official with 5.000
cruseiros. En route to the police headquarters. Berthier tried to bribe
the Sao Paulo policemen with 5 million crureiros. he went so far as to
suggest: "You let me go, I give you the money. and then you apologize to
me for the mistake."

Berthier was to be charged with possession because of a vial containing
several grams of cocaine. which he tried to get rid of on being arrested.
The police agents and the investigator assigned to the DEGRAN knew that
he possessed a large quantity of cocaine, and a Maverick parked a few
meters along the sidewalk was pointed out to them by a bank cashier. As
berthier did not have the keys on him. the policemen staked out the auto-
mobile beginning at dawn, and in the forenoon on 30 December, the wife of
the drug trafficksr came to get it. when arrested, she surrendered the
keys. In the search made of the vehicle four kilograms of cocaine and
equipment for distilling the drug were found in the trunk.

In his statement, Berthier identified the location at the l8-kilometer
marker on the Rio-Friburgo Road, in the municipality of Cachoeira do
Hacscu. where his distillery was located. his wife prepared cocaine for
sale there. The drying was done in a homemade apparatus with five ZOO-watt
light bulbs. Berthier was sentenced to three years in prison for drug
trafficking in Sao Paulo. The police found that he had links with groups
of drug peddlera in the United States.

Transporting Marijuana to Sao Paulo

Among the marijuana "bosses" in Paraguay, two names are always mentioned

by drug traffickers who are arrested. One is "Colonel" Hirsnda and the
other is known as cimenee. Cimenes is s Paraguayan. speaks Portuguese

well, and uses various private roads (through ranches) to transport the
"weed" as far as Campo Grande. This route is also used to move cars stolen
from various states, mainly Rio and Sao Paulo. As soon as the vehicles
enter Paraguayan territory, the license plates are removed and according

to one dealer "there ie no further problem. The Paraguayan police pay no
attention." Such cars are easily sold and in order for the Brazilian owners
to get them back. “they would have to send someone to steal them."

in order to avoid the police roadblocks along the routes from the frontier
through Hate Groaso and Parana to the towns of See Paulo. the drug traffickers
use a number of techniques. The so-called "bag men," who carry small
quantities of marijuana, cocaine and barbiturates, pay the dining car

waiter on the train or a kitchen helper to take charge of a piece of

baggage and return it after the passengers get off the train. The favorite
etation is that in Bauru. and for this favor, the drug traffickers pay

three to five thousand cruzeiros.

Another method is shipment by bus. The drug trafficker seeks out a pas-
senger and gives him a baggage check, telling him that when he arrives in

53
Sao Paulo or Rio. a relative will collect the piece of luggage. Many
individuale who have nothing to do with the euiteaee full of druge have
already been arreeted.

Vehiciea

Drug treffickere alwaya find a way of concealing druge in vehiclea and
getting peet inepectiona without problem. In recent monthe they have been
ueing light trucke of the 610 and Clh modele with double bottome beneath
the heedlighte called "ehelvee." into which marijuana ia packed. This
"adaptation" ie made by tinemithe in mechanical workehope in Ponta Pore,
Pedro Juan Caballero and Campo Grende.

The running boarde of peeeenger cere. particularly Corcel medele. are
ueed for tranerorting cocaine. with email plaetic cache of cocaine placed
in each runnin; heard. a kilogram of the drug can be carried on each aide.

Pervitin ie placed in plaetic eecke and hidden in the cavity of a Volkewagen
door. Or. by removing the interior light from the roof of a vehicle, n

drug trefficker can traneport $00 cepeulee or more than a thoueand drug
tablete. Secke of cocaine or preeeed eheete of marijuana are aleo hidden
among the loge in trucke hauling timber.

Age Analytic of Addicte

A etudy made by a commieeion made up of representativee of the Hinietriee
of Social Security, health and Juetice reached the conclueion that about
63 percent of the drug addicte receiving treatment in the 272 paychiatric
hoepitale under contract to the INAHPS throughout the country are between
19 and 35 yeere of age. with e male-female ratio of two to one.

In almoet all hoepitel enrollment enelyeee, the patiente diagnoeed ee
dependent on druge under the international dieeaae claeaificetion code
account for three percent of the total. dietributed by type of addiction
ae followe: marijuana. 67.6 percent; cocaine, 8.3 percent; opium. 6.3
percent; berbituretee, 2.6 percent; hallucinogena and other druge, 37.3
percent.

in the view of judge Alyrio Cavallieri of Rio de Janeiro. a five-point
program might resolve the probleme created by druge in our eociety:

l--Bliminating the permieeive etmoephere; 2--Unremitting preaecutien of

drug traffickere, ae the main criminal element; 3--lntroduction of a free
aeeietence service for adulte, euch ae that ueed for minore; 4--Eetabliehment
of behavioral clinice with interdieciplinary teams; 5--Laeting educational
campaigne of a didactic nature in primary echoole, with the teachers them-
eelvee ee adminiatretore.
Rio do Janeiro leade in the number of drug coneumera. followed by Sao
Paulo. nelo horizonte and Braeilie. The majority of the addicte. according
to the atudy. are not financially able to pay for treatment at a good
clinic, and no remain in ordinary prieone with a minimum of medical-
peychiatric treatment. Thue the chancea for recovery are very limited.
Currently. the majority of the prieonora at the Sao Paulo detention
facility are addicted to druge.

why Are Druge Abuaed?

According to paychologiet Yara Garcia Paoletti of the Richat Inetitute,
ecientific circlea identify three factore leading an individual to aeek

out druga: individual, family and eocial. In the view of thie peychologiet,
"thia problem which ie ao blatant nowadaye hee been the eubject of equally
blatant apathy. Perhepe thia ie becauee it requirea a broad analyeia,

not only directed toward a therapeutic approach to drug eddicta. but eleo
the family and eocial etructuree themaelvee in which the problem develope.

and thia leede to e reaeeceament and a reorganization which ie indeed
unpleaeant."

In hie book "Druge--The individual. Family and Society," the Argentine
phyeician Eduardo Keline notea that "the drug addict ia only traneleting
into the field of hie individual life the reletione. characterized by
alienation, prevailing in the eociety to which he belonge, a repreeeive
eociety." The taking of druge, again from the individual point of view.
involvea the fantaay of omnipotence, control of the entire outer world and
expanded narciaeiem, end when the effecte of the drug have peaeed.
depreaaion develope with characterietice which are devaetating to the ego:
eelf-deatructive tendenciea. ewareneae of mortality, dependence and a
aenee of dieeocietion, alienation and total involvement.

Paychologiat Yare Garcia Peoletti aleo aeye that "the more inteneive the
proceee becomee, the more intolerable thinking about and living with

reality becomee. aince it meena recognizing the contradictiona, the fragility
of the grandioee and agreeable aeneatione produced by tho intoxicated etate."

With regard to the family, thia paychologiet believee that "in the family
of the drug addict the eama trend ia to be found, but in other forma--
alcohol, pille. amoking, food, etc, juetifying therapy for all members of
the familiee of drug addicte."

With regard to the aocial aepccte, the inability of the drug addict to
aeaume hie proper reeponeibilitiea in eociety continuea to be preeumcd.
The role aaaigned to addicte. thia paychologiet went on to any. ie char-
acterized by exclueion and alienation.

Police Confirm Problen
See Paulo 0 BSTADO DE SAD PAULO in Portugueee 30 Jan 79 p 32

[Text] The majority of the police officiale in the towne mentioned in the
article "Drug Abuee in the Interior of Sao Paulo" publiehed by thie
newepaper on Sunday praieed it. but they admitted that the battle ageinet
drug abuee in the interior ie extremely difficult. beceuee all of the drug
addicte end deelere know who the police are. According to an official in
Merilie, the moat difficult thing ie to catch dealere in the act. "It
even eeeee that the drug traffickere know every etep the police take."

The chief of the Coeetal Police Department, Paulo de Ahmeide Vinhae, wae
the moat emphatic in hie praiee of the work of reporter Renato Lombardi.

He eeid that "articlee like thie ehould be publiehed frequently, becauee
their effect ie highly poeitive. Vinhae admitted that eoue of the namee of
drug traffickare in the region given in the article were unknown to him.
but he made the filee of the regional police headquartare available to

O BSTADO to eupplement the report.

Paulo Almeide Vinhae defende the view that arreete of drug traffickere
ehould be reported in the preee, a procedure now prohibited by the drug
abueo law. "I do not believe that euch publicity contributee to increeeing
drug traffic. 0n the contrary, when there ie police control, there ie a
trend toward a decreeee in theee crinee. with the printing of reporte and
photographe of drug traffickere. the population ehould help ue to find
theee criminele, and would eleo be aware of the tremendoue and thenkleee
teak being carried out by the police in thie battle.

The coaetal region police chief eaid further that the drug abuee law "ie
very helpful to the violator. The drug addict (who ie regarded ae eick end
can eerve hie term in a hoepital) ie very often a dealer too. Protected
by hie etetue ae an addict. he evoide the hareher penaltiee." Vinhae eleo
urged greater cooperation between etete and federal police authoritiee.
eince in hie view "it doee little good for e etete to combat thie evil if
the othere are not equally energetic."

In Marilie, where in the month of January alone eeven pereone were caught

in the act of ueing marijuana and arreeted, the police admit that it ie
rather difficult to find out who ie reeponeible for the dietribution of the
drug in the town. According to police agente involved in the enti-drug-abuee
campaign, the two drug treffickere identified by 0 ESTADO ae "Gembe" and
"Paraguaio" are not well known to the police. The firet mentioned, they

any. is a truck driver, and "Paraguaio" ie the owner of a fleet of trucke
with headquartere in Ponta Porn. A number of timee the police have tried
without eucceee to catch him dietributing marijuana.

The police aeeert that theee are not the only euppliere of druge in the
town. Valdeir Berroe de Oliveira wee caught red-handed with four kilograme

S6
of marijuana. but in the end he wee releeeed. Leter. when the court
ordered hie preventive erreet, he hed dieeppeered. The eene thing heppened
with Alcldee Condoli, of Herilie. who wee arroeted in Divinopolie, Hines
Goteie, in poeeeeeion of note then 50 kilogrene of the weed.

The police in Sorocebe revoeled thet ebeut eight etreete e month are node
in the town for uee or poleeeeion of drugs, and that the problem ie
tether eerioue. The number of erreete ie relatively low. beceuee unof-

JUDGE PREDICTS INCREASED DRUG ADDICTION IN 1980's
Sao Paulo 0 BSTADO DB SAD PAULO in Portuguese 13 Feb 79 p 23

[Text] Caspinss--Judge Hladiuir Valler of the Third Crisinal Jurisdiction
of Caspines asserted yesterday that during the coning decade there will be
"a pronounced increase of drug addicts in the nation." based upon the sta-
tistics according to which 50 percent of the Brazilian population is under
18 years of age. According to the judge. "the sajority of addicts are
youths between the ages of 18 and 25." In a talk given at the local Rotary
Club, he praised the reporting on the subject by 0 ESTADO DB SAD PAULO. as
published on 28 January and which exposed drug traffic in the interior of
the state and its route to the state capital. "1 can affirm that there are
35,000 addicts in Campinas. as reported in the news item. That figure. if
not rigorously exact, is very close to reality. which is to say that the
problem is serious."

Meanwhile. deputy Ricardo Paiva Prado. head of the drug section of the
Csspinas Regional Police. in consenting on the newspaper story. said that
the "structure of the material is factual." but he does not believe that
5 percent of the Caspinas population is addicted to narcotics.

Social Problem

According to Judge Valler. in the lB—to-ZS age group there are "youths
without a family. whose parents are separated and who are without work or
occupational skill.

"The great concern," he asserted. "is that the statistics show that there
was a considerable increase in addicts during recent years.

"These statistical data are elarning. when it is known that 50 percent of
the Brazilian population today consists of adolescents. This scene that
during the next decade all of these youths who teach the age of 18 will
have strong probabilities of also hecoaing addicts."

Regarding crininal proceedings involving traffickers. the judge eaphasites
that "the existence of proceedings is in direct proportion to police action
in suppressing clandestine drug treffic." He acknowledges that "the
courts do not have a specific apparatus for colbating the ectivities of
traffickers and addicts. and always depend upon police action." In his

Regarding the addict. he asserts that "although nedicopsychiatric treetnent

[Editorial: “The Faults of Drugs"!

(Text! The story is spread by anecdote and legend, although many have ran-
aon to believe it devoutly: there are parties being held. they say. at
which silver trays are passed among the guests. replete with small white
envelopes filled with cocaine--coke. powder. “paulo otevio" or any other
pseudonym of the moment.

it could be merely the carioca imagination functioning at full steam. It
matters little. Even without the symbolism of the tray carried by gloved
hands. even without taking account of the almost pathetic exaggerations of
the sensationalist press. it would be Psnglossian ingenuousness to ignore
that addiction has a firmly established bridgehead in upper-middle-class
society.

of course. it is a matter of a numerically insignificant group. and Brazil-
ian society does not by any means face the crises of decadence that other
nations are contending with. but this does not prevent confirming the ex-
istence of drug consumption sufficiently voluminous to support a LJIPIO‘
system of production and traffic.

These systems exist. Not as a sinister tentecular organization. but as-
sembled by various gangs and individuals. all attracted by the intense
profits offered by a market where the disoriented mingle with the simply
foolish. hand in hand with the irresponsibles and the poor in spirit gen-
erally.

in defense of the users. it is said that the addict does harm only to him—
self. This could be true. in exclusive reference to the consumption of
drugs. But such an argument (which should not be forgotten in the treat-
ment of the question by police) ignores the decisive role of the addict in
popularizing and financing drug traffic.

It is also said that drugs such as marihusna and cocaine do not create an
organic addiction-—this conclusion. however. of a supposedly scientific

60
basis. is neutralized by the equally proven fact that in many cases they
create a psychological need as compelling as the worst physical dependency.
And there are numerous other unfavorable consequences of the continued use
of drugs-some as serious as those of alcoholism, others certainly worse.
especially in the area of emotional stability.

The essential point to bear in mind is that the person who consumes drugs
such as cocaine is not only exposing himself to physical end psychic
damages of incalculable extent; he is also contributing to the support of
one of the criminal activities most harmful to the community, since the
high profitability and the fabulous quantities that are involved result in
an equally large potential for corruption and encouragement of other crimes.

Such as, for example. homicide. Claudia Lessin Rodrigues is our best known
victim. But the particularly tragic aspects of her death do not make it
exceptional. Cases such as here or. under different circumstances. that of
young Felipe Oliveira in Leblon serve merely as symbols and examples of the
small price of human life in the brutal world of drug traffickers.

The police do what they can. or what they think they can. In any event,
the evil cannot be eliminated merely through repressive mechanisms.

It is really a social disease. and only the entire society. aware of its
responsibilities-~and, in various ways. of its complicity through omission
--can combat it with any hope of success.

The battle begins. clearly. by example. The example of emphatic and well
founded opinion about the subject and. when it is the case, the admirable
example of refusal.

It is a matter. in sum. of taking the only really effective measure and the
only one with lasting effect: to drive the trafficker into unemployment.
killing him with hunger. before he can be the direct ceuse-snd his clients
the indirect causes-~of more deaths in our midst.

TRAFFICKER ARRESTED LEAVING PARAGUAY-Traffickar Adauto Pedro Teixeira was

Primavera on the Parana River. In his car. a Caravan with Santos plates.
police seized 25 kilograms of marihuans and 505 grams of cocaine. purchased
in the Paraguayan city of Pedro Juan Caballero. Adauto Pedro Teixeira said
he was going to sell the drugs in Sao Paulo and Rio and police believe that
this is not the first shipment made by the traffickar. his arrest occurred
during a roadblock set up by police in the Porto Primavera area--the place
is part of the route known to be utilized by traffickers. in Campinas.
deputy Ricardo Paiva Prado. of the narcotics section. denied that there are
35,000 addicts in the city. as reported in material published by 0 ESTADO
DE SAD PAULO. According to him. such a figure is exaggeratedly high and he
also stated that of the traffickers mentioned in the report only two are
still "working" in Campinas. the others being either in prison or fugitives.
The deputy credits the information which he says is incorrect to the police
officer known as "Lazinho": "his personal knowledge is not very up-to-date;
hence he is unaware of the progress that Campinas police have achieved in
the fight against drugs." he explained. Deputy Jose Hanoel de Hours Hatos.

ANTIDRUD EFFORTS 1N PlRACICAbA--The Sectional Police Station of Piracicaba

cording to the deputy. consumption of drugs. which began to increase in
Piracicsba about 5 years ago. was controlled by various preventive measures
adopted by police and by the community itself and the number addicts today
must be about 5.000. In disputing information contained in the report en-
titled "The Power of Drugs in the Interior." published by 0 BSTADO DE 8A0
PAULO, the sectional deputy stated that the most used drugs are marihusna
and pervitin. which come from Paraguay. Police made only two arrests this
month for possession of marihusna. nlthough consumption of drugs increases
greatly at Carnival time. The sectional deputy says the drug problem in
Piracicsba is exactly the same as in other cities of equal size. although
representatives of local groups believe the police should initiate a more
effective campaign against drug use and traffic. That is the viewpoint of
Commerce Association President Telmo Otero. In Ararequara. police acknowl-
edged that there are several marihuena traffickers. such as Paraguayan
Halter Oscar Ramon Miranda Perreira, the "Ramos" who has not yet been
caught in the act. although he has been in the city for 2 years. [Text]

VENDETTA AMONG TRAFFICKERS. THO KILLED

Bogota EL TIEHPO in Spanish 6 Jan 78 p l-A, lb-B

[Text] A man and a woman traveling together in a motor vehicle were rid-
dled with bullets yesterday in confusing incidents related to a "settle-
ment of accounts” between individuals involved in cocaine trafficking.

Authorities were trying last night to establish the details of of the tragic
incident which occurred at the intersection of Boyuca Avenue and the Medel-
lin freeway about 6 pm and which also caused a panic among residents and
passersby in this section of Bogota.

The victims were identified as Ivan Fernando Tarquino Baquero of Bogota,
28 years old. and hilda Orjuels Forero, 26 years old and a native of

Ibague. Another man traveling in the same vehicle and going by the name
of Ruben Dario Sanchez was seriously wounded and is fighting for his life
in the Country Clinic.

According to eyewitness reports. the red Renault 12, with a free transit
permit and owned by one of the brothers of Ivan Tarquino bequero. was
blocked by another vehicle from whoae interior several unknown assailants
fired machinegun blasts.

Another car-a Hercedes Benz-~olso took part in blocking the victin's
Renault and it is reported that they were followed for about 10 blocks
before reaching Boyaca Avenue.

The vehicle in which the victims were traveling, with free transit No S-
20956. was moved to the P-2 yards for taking fingerprints and making other
investigations related to the incident.

This incident represents the first "vendetta" among individuals involved
in narcotics trafficking so for this year.

The commissioner of public events. Marta Mendez. had the bodies removed
and stated that the wounded man. Ruben Dario Sanchez, was helped by a
taxi driver. who took him to the Country Clinic.

According to the official's report, 20.000 poses in dollars. a .357 Magnum
revolver and numerous pieces of jewelry were found on lvan Fernando Tarquino
Baquero.

The victims did not get to use the powerful revolver because of the speed
with which the unknown assailants acted. firing on them from the pursuing
vehicle.

The commissioner also reported that two more suitcases belonging to Sanchez
were found, filled with personal items. and that he was apparently prepar-
ing to leave the country, although he was not carrying a passport.

The bodies of the victims were totally mangled by the bullets and were

found on top of each other in the front seat of the Renault 12 in which

they were traveling. The side windows were also totally destroyed. Authori-
ties believe that at least five machinegun blasts were fired by the unknown
assailants.

Hafioso "War"

The incident is related to the death of Cesar Augusto Tsrquino Baquero. the
brother of one of the victims and who was also riddled with machinegun fire
on 2 November of last year in a carpenter's shop at No 19-58 68th Street.

Cesar Augusto was a biologist who had recently graduated from the University
of the Andes and was assassinated by unknown assailants traveling in a red
Renault 12 automobile with a free transit permit and with the same features
as the car occupied by the victims of yesterday's incident.

67
Authorities were trying last night to establish a possible relationship be—
tween the two incidents. since the aforementioned features of the automo-

biles coincide and it is believed that Cesar Augusto was also connected
with cocain trafficking.

Another detail which strongly caught the attention of investigators was
the discovery of the method of the incident. from an EL TIEMPO clipping
from the edition of 2 November. in which an account was given of the death
of Cesar Augusto Tarquino Baquero.

Authorities annoucned that they will proceed with the investigation as far
as necessary to establish the identity of those responsible for this new
vendetta among Mafia members. Members arrested will be placed in the
custody of an examining magistrate.

[Text] Valledupar. ll Jan (by lnfsnta Horeno)-The governor of El Cesar.
Jose Guillermo Castro Castro. today approved a fine of 2 million pesos

for dentist. farmer and rancher Dario Lacouture Acosta, owner of the
Nebraska ranch in the Jurisdiction of the municipality of Becerril, because
of the discovery of a clandestine airport where foreign planes landed and
took off with aarihuans destined for the U.S. black market.

The decision was adopted by means of a justified resolution which stated
that the runway was 2,000 meters long and was being used in connection with
the landing o! airplanes with U.S. registration for transporting processed

marihuana up to the time that it was discovered by units of the "La Pops"
battalion.

The same resolution penalizing dentist Lacouture Acosta also applies to his
two brothers. Jesus and Bfriaa Lscouture Acosta.

During the visual inspection by the departsental representative in mid-
December. 12 containers of premium gasoline were found. as well as 20 large
gas lamps for night landings. tents. fuel pumps and the roofs of the build-
ings were painted with aeronautical orientation indicators.

Governor Castro Castro severely applied the standards recomended in the

Security Law concerning clandestine airports whose owners are Colo-bian
citizens.

This is the second sanction applied by the governor. once improper use of
the clandestine runway was established.

Questioned by EL TIEMPO concerning the continued application of the measures
recounended in the Security Law in regard to clandestine airports. he
stated that he will continue to impose the law. as he did in individuals of
privileged classes in El Cesar. who were prosperous cotton farmers in

the past but who resorted to crime because of poor harvests.

He also stated that three new airports have been discovered by the DA5
[Administrative Department of Security] and the army and that they will be
exempliarily penalized once for the facts for makings decision have been compiled.

[Text] Pure cocaine worth more than 30 million pesos was seized by the

Federal Judicial Police who also arrested four drug traffickers. including
one Bolivian.

The drug deal was to have been consummated at the Liverpool parking lot, in
Plaza Satelite; adnd it was there that the following persons were arrested:
Maria de la Luz Salinas Pena. Osvaldo Max Ponce Acosta and Berta Cecilia
Sanchez Flores.

Later the agents under the orders of Gen Raul Mendiolea Cerecero arrested
an accomplice of the prisoners. Jesus Median Zavala. in Culiacan. Sinaloa.

The police also learned the names of other drug traffickers operating in
Chicago lU.5.A.] and in Bolivia. The Federal Judicial Police have already
asked for the cooperation of police authorities from those countries to
conduct investigations and make arrests, if appropriate.

General Hendiolea said that investigation of this case had been started
2 months ago when Interpol had informed the police that a Bolivian had
brought 1.5 kilograms of cocaine into the country.

The Federal Police thus found out that a connection between the wife of a
prison innate and international drug trafficking had been made from the
Nuevo Laredo. Tamaulipas prison.

Alejandro Pena. the alleged chief of this r!“ who is conducting operations
from inside the jail. is serving a 20-year pr-.on term for crimes against

72 toxic capsules (psychedelic) and a vial of morphine were found.

The investigation revealed that Jacqueline Petit had recen‘ly gone to the
penitentiary to visit Hamel Fernandez Cabrera, who had told her where the
drug could be found. They decided to rescue it, because in a search ordered
by the federal judge the "corpus delicti" might be found.

Jacqueline and Caracas de la Cruz broke the seals, took out the drugs and burned
then at the home of the publisher of INVITATION.

However, the police had been watching the movements of all suspects, and with
the arrest of the last two of then, they got a detailed statement which will
help then continue their fight against the drug traffickers in Aapalco.

MAJOR ILLEGAL DRUG TRAFFIC ROUTES DESCRIBED
Buenos Airea CLARIN in Spanish 28 Dec 78 p 24

[Text] "On a remote and dusty road winding through the Bolivian Andes,
behind a billboard reading 'cod and love, the only hope. 201d drinks

for ssle,‘ there is a curve. A little farther on one can see row after

row of delicate plants with greyiah leaves, planted as far end as wide as
the eyes can see up the mountain. They are coca plants. There in Chulunani
is the beginning of the 'cocaine highway' which leads in its final lap to
the United States. This highway is expanding rapidly. becoming ever more
violent and involving thousands of millions of dollars."

This is how Associated Press newsman Bruce Handler began his lengthy
report, after traveling all over the continent to search out the reasons
for the increase in the illegal traffic in cocaine between South America
and the United States, despite the redoubled efforts to restrain it.

Various governments in South America and the United States, through its
Drug Enforcement Administration, the State Department, the FBI, the
customs and tax collection agencies. are trying to destroy this connection

today. But the efforts are failing. due to the increasing drug consumption
by Aaericans.

The Drug Enforcement Adninistration under the Department of Justice in the
United States currently has three tines as nsny agents in South America
as it did five years ago. The seizures of cocaine and the arrests of
presumed drug traffickers have doubled on the continent since 1975. end

in some places. such as Peru. have quintupled.

Ineffective Efforts

But all of these efforts are virtually fruitless. The new laws on narcotics
in Latin America are difficult to inplement, and the increase in seizures

has changed the picture little. Cocaine continues to be transported to
the north.

"The reason is very simple." a discouraged Drug Enforcement Administration
agent explains. "More Americans want more cocaine. The market is expanding.

81
Prices are rising, drug traffickers are prepared to invest more money
and to risk more in an effort to get rich in the coeaine business."

U.S. agents working on the "cocaine highway" estimate privately that an
unprecedented quantity of 65 tons of almost pure South American cocaine
was smuggled into the United States in 1978.

Taking the current price of cocaine in the United States, $100 per gram
of 50 to 60 percent pure cocaine, as a basis the smuggled quantity repre-
sents $9 billion.

Bolivia and Peru

Practically all the cocaine reaching the United States comes from Bolivia
or Peru. About 28 tons of the total smuggled this year were probably
produced from Peruvian coca leaves, while some 17 tons would have come
from Bolivia, according to experts in the subject.

The coca leaf is a traditional crop in both countries. Both Bolivians and
Peruviana still raise and chew coca leaves legally.

The largest source of the coca crop exported to the United States is the
settlement of Tingo Maria in Peru. In that eastern Andean location, coca
plants are grown along with bananas, pineapple, coffee and avocados.

"The only thing one must do to raise coca is to put the seeds in the

ground," says Julio Doris, administrator of a 20-hectsre plantation called
Villa del Sol.

Bolivia and Peru have prohibited further plantings of coca, and have made
it compulsory for the present producers, transporters and sellers of coca
to register with the authorities, in order to make control more effective.

“The effect of the new provisions concerning coca growing has been zero,
zero, zero," says a disgusted official at the PIP [Peruvian Investigative
Police], which is the Peruvian counterpart of the F31. "The peasants say
that they have not extended their plantings or that they are only planting
coca for legal chewing. But they are lying, for everyone knows that every
day more and more coca is being planted here."

Gabriel Duran, owner of a two-hectare coca plantation in Bolivia, says
that "I would grow something else, such as coffee or oranges, particularly
if the government cooperated and gave me financial aid. There is always

a market for coca, the price is always going up."

At the general headquarters of the PIP in Line, the second in command of
that body, Chief Inspector Artidoro Mejia, gave his viewpoint. "Coca is
raised in regions of which we do not even have detailed maps. The drug
traffickers use fleets of planes to transport the cleaned plants. We need

82
helicopters to patrol the coca plantations. We need radar and weapons to
bring down the drug traffickers' aircraft. but we have none of this.“

Between 70 and 90 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States
leaves South America through Colombia. “It is a good place to operate.
It is near North America and has a lengthy coastline both on the Pacific

and the Caribbean," an OAS [Organization of American States] investigator
comments.

The processing of the washed cocaine paste is generally done in secret
laboratories in the large Colombian cities-Hedellin. Cali and Bogota.

The washed Peruvian and Bolivian cocaine paste comes into Colombia along
two main routes. Three-quarters cones through Ecuador, either overland,
in automobiles, trucks. and buses. or by boat.

Quito is just a few hours from Cali by road. The rest comes through the
Amazon forest. carried by a fleet of river vessels or private planes. The
second route is longer and more expensive. but because the drug traffickers
who choose this system use planes, they can carry ever-larger quantities.
sometimes up to 300 kilograms. The Colombian city of Leticia is the main
coordination point for this Amazon route.

Cocaine from Peru and Ecuador is generally transported to the United States
in private or commercial airplanes and by merchant vessel. Bolivian
cocaine may also be sent directly north via private or airline planes, or
it may be sent via Paraguay or Brazil.

HARD DRUG USE INCREASING AMONG YOUTBS
Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 9 Feb 79 Sec c. p 3 '
[Article by Jose Emilio Costellsnoa]

[Text] An alarming "hard drugs” traffic among the country's adolescents has
been detected by psychiatrist Rafael Ernesto Lopez, director of CETRAC [Com-
munity Treatment Center], who has found among his patients--a11'youngo—sn
increase in the use of injected cocaine.

Lopez is a student of the drug problem in youths and has performed sbatruse
research based on his clinical consultations and on the CETRAC he directs.
He studied medicine at the Central University of Venezuela and did his post-
graduate in psychiatry at McGill University in Canada. He is a psycho-ans-
lytic therapist.

Giving the alert, he reveals that among his patients he has found youths
with necrotic veins, decayed body L.ssues and brain damage due to the effect

of injected hard drugs, including some synthetically prepared opiates.

"It is true that Venezuela is used as a bridge in the international narcotics
traffic. but part of these shipments are distributed among the country's
adolescents and youths. Only 10 percent of drugs fall into police hands.

"The tendency of some youths to defy death by resorting to these hard drugs
is visible." he says. "Many have set marihusna aside to turn to injected
narcotics, what they call 'fisiarse'. Those who have fallen in that trap
emerge with envy and rivalries toward normally behaving youths. In this Hey
aggressive groups appear. as well as all the sequence of known deviations.
including violence and theft in order to obtain cocaine."

He refers to four fundamental problems that drive the adolescent in a dis-

oriented way toward drugs: social. family and individual problems and those
related to the drug itself.

85
"There is a phenomenon known as the drug culture." he specifies. "which has
involved adolescents throughout the world and goes hand in hand with the
reduction of space on earth. with the large cities. A kind of international
youth union has been created around drugs."

"The 'Travolta' phenomenon. for example." he says. "is not new; it is not

a matter of today's youths imitating Travolta. He porsonifies an existing
situation which has arisen in many countries and comes to Venezuela. as the
herd druga. 9 years after it arrived in the United States."

Drugs and Gangs
0r Lopez has also conducted abstruse studies about the gangs. their social
complexity and their relation to the environment in which youth develops.

"In general." he points out. "gangs are constituted by groups of adolescents
and young adults of both sexes who come together without any explicitly
defined purpose. but who achieve an internal and unconscious cohesion caused
by many and complex factors. Even though contact with the rest of society
can vary. the most prominent group manifestation is undoubtedly the danger-
ous and destructive aggressiveness."

He asked him about the resurgence of gangs in Venezuela. taking into account
that his work deals with youths having behavior problems.

"Present-day resurgence [of gangsl." he points out. "may have been stimulated
by the constant rise in cocaine usage, especially injected."

He tells of three fundsmente: factors which lead youths to integrate them-
selves into chase groups which we call gangs: factors characteristic of
adolescence. group and family factors. And he develops each of them.

”The need to reaffirm an identity: the adolescent suffers. is no longer a
child, and therefore does not enjoy the protection parents grant children.
But neither is he an adult. and lacks therefore the position. security or
social and psychological definition provided by adulthood. The 'group'
provides the possibility of belonging. and an identity. even if negative.

"The adolescent must protect himself from the childish feelings he just

gave up at the appearunce of puberty. Socially. the fragility. dependency
and insecurity of childhood are identified with the feminine character and
are perceived as feminine. The adolescent must emphasize the aggressive as
an expression of manliness and machismo to protect himself from his internal
sexual confusion. which draws him closer to weakness and femininity accord~
ing to these reasonings.

"The pubescent explosion: Puberty appears with extraordinary violence. in
such a way that. while still a child from the psychological point of view
of emotional maturity. the adolescent is already biologically capable of pro-
creation."

86
About Group causes. Lopes focuses his analysis in this way:

"A person is exposed to group pressure. In the group there is always a
leader who stands out by virtue of characteristics related to what I just
said: more courage, lore aggressiveness and a talent for taking risks.
There are. in addition. secondary leaders or deputies and then come the
feminine components of the group and the mass. Internally within the group
there are rivalries where woman's position plays an important role."

The psychiatrist analyzes also the so-called "negative identification.” And
he finds truth in the premise that gangs are constituted by the nalsdjusted.

"These youngsters." he points out, "always cone from homes in conflict, not
necessarily divorced. since a legally constituted and apparently conflictleas
Iarriage can hide the germ of delinquency. For exanple, a frequently found
couple structure among upper middle class gangs is that of an exaggeratedly
fearful and insecure nether. a kind of girl mother, whose behavior is quite
inconsistent when dealing with the children. offering anything to pacify

the child, but not coning through with it. It is a mother ready to agree to
anything. due to the insecuri ; and the fear she experiences.

"0n the other hand. the father may be a prominent person. socially important.
often violent and. above all. distant and busy. By virtue of the importance
that material possessions have for thee families. this is reflected in a
behavior in which interior values and even love are replaced by external
possessions.

"The adolescent feels then that the intellectual acquisitions which are
natural for his age--to study. to compete in sports--are not within his reach:
they belong to others, whom he envies and tries to attack by showing that

that is stupid, that there is no worse crime than 'being carrot' [not taking
drugs], that shrewd is he who acquires things, he who takes advantage. This
is than the code that dominates gang subculture and creates a negative pres-
sure on these who. due to the structure of their own families, are also
predisposed." '

Finally he refers to the generalized attitude of parents toward both boys

and girls which instills the idea of machisno in an unconscious motivation
toward violence and aggressiveness.

BASHIR AL-JUHAYYIL DISCUSSES DRUGS, ADDICTION
Beirut AL-‘AHAL in Arabic 28 Jan 79 p 4

[Report on interview with Bashir al-Jumayyil, leader of the Lebanese Forces,

date and place not given: "He Have Invadsd the Dena and Have Arrested the
Chiefs of the Trade Networks"]

[Text] The widening of the wave of addiction to narcotics and the existence
of variOus sectors of society in danger of falling in-u experimentation with

drugs is a .ragic, present supposition which must be treated as soon as pos-
sible.

Since official legal prosecution has been impossible due to the exceptional
circumstances which have necessitated the continued impotence of authority,
and because of the sudden danger of the wave of addiction which threatens all
smokers with annihilation, and since it carries in its wake a great danger

to the well-being and purity of the society and country. the Lebanese Resis-
tance, representing the judiciary committee of the Lebanese Forces, has been
compelled to deal with the problem, and to put an end to the tragic situation
which threatens the country with most dangerous consequences. The special
organization, in the name of the Lebanese Resistance, has taken steps guar-
anteeing to pursue the drug dealers and distributors, and all those connected
with this network. it has also taken all possible measures to assist those
who have fallen victim to drugs, and to restore them healthy to society.

Among these steps, for example. is the arrest of drug smugglers, manufacturers
and dealers and local networks of distribution. They were forced, after the
period of trial stipulated by Lebanese law, to attend centers specified by

the Lebanese Forces once every 2 weeks to corroborate a body of evidence.

They were also subjected to strict observation, both them and all their
friends and those who have been dealing with them.

Hr Bashir al-Jumayyil, leader of the Lebanese Forces, spoke briefly on this
subject. He said:

89
"The problem of addiction has urgently confronted us. and we can no longer
ignore it. Until recent years. Lebanese people did not use drugs. In the
past few months. injuries have occured among the ranks of the populace due to
bombings. without drugs being blamed for these incidents. This is what
alerted us to the existence of an urgent health and social problem. We dis-
cowered that between 50 and 60 percent of the crimes. thefts and legal of-
fences which occur are from certain elements of society. which I would not
say are undisciplined. but are elements which are not conscious of and irre-
sponsible in their actions because of their use of drugs." Mr Bashir added:
"We commissioned the security organizations with carrying out a study on this
subject. and it became ef'er to them that 60 percent of the criminals come
from the alcohol. narcot. . and gambling dens. He decided to treat the pro-
biem in a radical way. we saw. that it was best. before resorting to punish-
ing criminals after a crime is committed. to deal with the causes of crime.
we decided to raid the alcohol and narcotics dens where the addicts become
unable to distinguish between good and bad. He raided them and we confiscated

significant quantities. He were able to discover extensive networks which
were undercover and unsuspected.

"The step which we have taken has enabled us to arrest all the chiefs and

the networks attached to them, and their branches in our communities. In one
of the raids. we confiscated a laboratory for manufacturing imported drugs.
which belonged to a person who is looked up to by society with respect and
trust. We hesitated a great deal before making the raid. He were afraid to
knock on the door of a man who has self-respect and is esteemed by society,
and find that he is innocent. But finally we did raid. and we confiscated
the laboratory and destroyed it. This man is from the well-known 'velvet

society .

in response to another question. Bashir said; "The tragedy of addiction to
drugs has accompanied all wars. when the communists entered South Vietnam.
they found approximately 150.000 addicts in a state of complete breakdown.
who were no more than skin and bones. There are armies from the most pro-
gressive and powerful countries which fear with alarm the entry of drugs into
their ranks. In any case. we have informed international authorities and
some concerned states of the situation in Lebanon.

"From the Information obtained from the investigation carried out by the in-
vestigators of the 'special organization' which deals with the problems of
gambling clubs and narcotics done we have discovered a new world which is
self-sufficient and has its own phrases and subtle expressions. like 'nekzah'
linjectionl. 'shsmma' [sniff] and 'sskh'ah' [snort]. It was observed that
the 'croupiers'. the money-changers and restaurant owners are usually those
who facilitate the exchange. They store the drugs in small quantities and
give it to customers on demand."

One of the investigators reports to AL-‘AHAL that the patrons of the net-

works intervened at first, and they thought that they were dealing with the
mentality which prevailed before 1975. "They were taken by surprise when

90
they learned that in the welfare of those who were apprehended we had clear
directives to arrest anyone who would interfere. in view of the detailed in-
formation which the investigation has obtained and the accuracy of its grasp
on the drug traffic, a number of dealers hastened to quietly surrender what
they had in order to protect their reputation. It was observed that the
chiefs of the drug networks are well-known men of society who take advantage
of their trusted command over people to engage in drug traffic, exporting
and importing, as well as manufacturing them in local laboratories.

"With regard to cocaine the manufacturing is carried out in two stages. it

is imported from Bolivia and other South American countries, mostly by sea.

it is mixed with chemical substances, so that 'al-baz', the raw material,

is dissolved and hecomes like a powder which is easy to inhale. Usually the
heat kind is discerned by rubbing it between the fingers; if the powder dis-
appears, the specimen is good. If it leaves a trace between the fingers, the
specimen is bad. The quality of cocaine is also ascertained by mixing it with
water.

"The strangest thing that we discovered is that the importers and distributors
of drugs in the western areas [of Beirut] are well-known men who have been
outstanding in the political arena during the last 6 years.

"However, Znhlah remains the uncontested source of drugs. Lebanese author-
ities arrested one of the drug 'kings', or perhaps the 'klng of kings' a
year ago. There is talk of political interference. both local and other,

in order to release him! But to this day he is still in the hands of justice.

"As for hashlsh, the best kind in the world is grown and manufactured in
al-Biqa’-al-Hirmal. Compared with other kinds of drugs. it is a minor vice.
its harm is relatively limited and its price is reasonable, for the price of
a kilogram of hashish is less than the price of one gram of cocaine."

AL-‘AHAL does not bring up the problem of rampant addiction for the sake of
displaying information or to alarm people, but so that those who watch over
the well-being of the society and country will be aware of their responsi-
bilities in this matter, will hasten to adopt preventive and restrictive
awasures. and to assist those who have fallen into experimentation with
drugs to rise from It and to return to society.

if the Lebanese organizations and parties become aware of the danger of
addiction and ismwdiately adopt preventive and restrictive measures, this
campaign must he one of patience and perseverance for the youths of today
are the men of the future!

EDITORIAL QUESTIONS POLICE NETHODS AGAINST DEALERS
{otterdam URC HANDELSDLAD in Dutch 5 Feb 79 p 7
lﬁditorial: "American lbthodsﬁ?

lihng The chief of the Amsterdam narcotics brigade stated last year that,
in his field, American conditions are beginning to take hold in our country.
This appears not only to refer to the increasing aggressiveness of the hard
drug trade but also to the police methods used against this.

Following the American example, the Dutch police appear to be changing over
to the import of "undercover agents" who do not shrink from going into the
drug trade themselves. The Court of Justice in Amsterdam gave its blessings
on these tactics Friday and dismissed the reproach that the police themselves
are guilty of "provocation" in this.

in this case, said the court, the police provocation constitutes merely a
motive and not a cause; the suspects were already well into the drug trade.
The American Supreme Court, in 1976, ruled with similar reasoning that the
police are justified in putting decays into operation against suspects who
have shown themselves "predisposed" toward the drug trade.

From a criminal viewpoint, concepts such as "predisposition" are, however.
extremely dangerous and they merit very strict supervision. It is one thing
to use police decoys against professional drug dealers. but it is unacceptable
when a policeman (er informer) induces a suspect to perpetrate an offense
which, otherwise, he would have not so readily committed.

Furthermore. the American experience teaches that in the undercover sphere
questionable forms of intimidation or corrupt practices rear their heads.

Also, the contribution of such methods to crime control appears, for that

matter, less than what the police so eagerly suggests.

To pursue the American example somewhat further: there, at least the rule
still applies that evidence which is obtained contrary to "fair play"
regulations will he disregarded by the judge. The Dutch Penal Code, however.
contains no such provisions and the Dutch criminal judge, of old, does not
readily intrude into the domain of the Public Prosecutor who has jurisdiction
over the police and its methods.

95
Nevertheless. the Supreme Court has only in the past year tested evidence
in a number of cases against the "letter" of the Penal Code. There is
already talk of a new trend.

The Amsterdam Court new warns in the undercover case that it will not permit
any criminal prosecution which resulted from investigation methods at

odds with "correct procedural order"-again an expression which the Supreme
Court phrased last year.

Our chief justice. on that occasion (the Henten trial), intruded with so
many words into the, thus far, hallowed "doman" of the Public Prosecutor.
The Court of Justice in Arnhem twice already refused to accept a writ which
was introduced with unwarranted delay.

Such an active judician supervision is, incidentally, not as optional as
such vague terms as "procedural order" imply. The European Treaty for
Human Rights, binding for the Netherlands, charges the judge precisely
with the rcjectioa of illegal evidence and the safeguarding of a certain
amount of "equality in weapons" between accuser and defendant.

However welcome and just the new trend in justice may be. the question
remains whether the regulating of the new police methods of trickery and
deceit (because that is what they are, after all) is not too large a lump

to chew for the judge alone.

An outcome such as the one from the Amsterdam Court in the undercover case
becomes a lot easier to accept when the internal-managerial supervision of
police action in more precise. nut precisely the Amsterdam narcotics
fighters have become the talk of the town in the latter years.

Even in integrated internal and external supervision the question remains
whether such methods are justified only in serious drug offenses. 0r
firearms offenses also? The American police itself produced porn movies in

order to lure sex exploiters, and they even established a complete fencing
shop to catch the thieves. where will it end?

Because of this. in the final resort, it is a problem for the legislator.

This then, underlines the long-existing need to-fermally or informally--
legally purge the unbridled growth of policy authority.
