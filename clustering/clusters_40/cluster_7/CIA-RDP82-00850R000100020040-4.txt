POLICE 83128 murmur VALUE!) AT 8110 MILLION

Kuaia Lumpur Ill-2H STRAITS TIMES in English 3 Feb 79 pp 1, 20 BK

[Text] Kuala Luupur, Fri.--Police have seized 62 lb. of morphine of the
"999" brand worth about Silo million on the international market in Sungei
Patani after a 60-minute car chase Erna Alor Star.

The drug was found hidden in a specially constructed coupartnent in the
petrol tank of a Thai-registered car.

Police have detained two men.

Director of CID Com. Datuk Abdul Raln- bin Ismail said that the brand
of the morphine was well knowa.

he said: "We believe the source of this drug is Thailand but we don't
know exactly where."

Datuk Rhanan said the morphine could be easily converted into high grade
heroin.

"We are not certain if the drug was to be shipped overseas. If the nor-
phine was to be processed here it could produce 62 lb. of heroin--just as
much as the morphinenbut the profit would be much bigger."

Three Cars

he said that the morphine could provide about 2.3 million "shots."

in [Her Star last Thursday, officers from the Anti-Narcotics Unit of the

cm at the Federal headquarters waited for three hours at the stadium
alter .1 tip-off that a drug courier would be using the route.

when the of ficers, who were in three cars spotted the Thai-registered
vehicle at noon, they saw chase.

l-‘ort y minutes later they forced the vehicle to stop and on searching, the
officers found the morphine in the special compartment of the petrol tank.
Police picked up another suspect two daya later from Alor Star.
Datuk Rahmnn said this was their biggest single seilure this year.

he said that police had earlier arrested six people and seized three
and a half lb. of heroin in Kuala Lunpur and Penang early last month.

he added that 6,6A6 people were arrested for drug offences of which 123
have been charged for trafficking last year.

Eighteen people were convicted for trafficking last year.

The police seized 72.55 kilograms of heroin, 56.0l kilograns of morphine,
59.l6 kilograms of ganja and 629.85 kilograms of opium last year.

EDITORIAL CALLS FOR GREATER EFFORT AGAINST DRUGS
Sao Paulo 0 ESI‘ADO DE 8A0 PAUID in Portuguese 17 Jan 79 p 2

[Editorial by Fernando Cesar Mesquita: "Subversion and Drugs”!

[Text] if control of the traffic and increasing consuption of narcotics

had merited a tenth of the effort which the Mirch Revolution has spent con-
bating consmisn, drug addiction would not have been eliminated, but at least,
as in the case of subVersion, it would haVe been curbed. The military still

owe the Brazilian people this much success.

For lack of time and because of bureaucracy, the work begun by General Geisel
to correct official omission in this latter will not be completed, but General
Figuelredo could resume the initiatives of his predecessor and follow up the
studies of the inteministeriai group, which determined the need for creation
of the National System for Prevention, Supervision and Repression of Narcotics
and the National Drug Prevention Foundation.

Created in 1977 by Minister Armando Palcao, the Intenainisterial Omission
comprised representatives of the Ministries of Justice, Social Helmre and
llealth. The emission developed a quite complete study of narcotics and
conducted surveys in about 300 hospitals, looking toward adaptation of
specialized units for treatment and rehabilitation of addicts. however, as

usually happens when task forces are created, the draft laws embodying its
final rccounendations have been held up in the bureaucratic maze, between

the advisory staffs of the Justice and Health Ministries.

before 197'], although it constituted serious and challenging issues for the
nuthnri ties and politicians.

In 197's. a congressional investigating cosmittec, the reporter for which was

Impala I-‘rnncelim rereira, inVentigated the drug problem, and its conclusions
were later used as aids in the research of the inter-ministerial emission

62
created i yearn lutu-r by Minister AlWﬂhln I-‘nlcuo. Until then, the guvurmmmt
had left drug consumption cases to the police, like a lazy porter hiding the
dirt under the carpet.

True, effective actions were taken by psychiatrists like Prof Oswald Moracs
Andrade, Josue de Castro and many others who, through motions presented at
neurological, psychiatric and mental health conferences, sought to stress

the importance of education and general awareness in combating drugs, accord-
ing to them the only really valid weapons for an effectiVe battle against the
use and abuse of narcotics.

Regarding pertinent legislation, there in a 1938 decree and three important
laws, principally in: No 6,368/76, which even serves as a model for other
countries. As official interest was limited, public institutions ceased to
adopt broad and systematic measures, and control and prevention were neglected.

In its study. almost a pioneer effort, the Interministerial Commission (com-
prising Jose Jose Cary, Alberto Mmoel Dias Magalhaes and Carlos Velloso de
ol-wnlra) has the cooperation of specialists of the Clinical Hospital, the
henropsyehiatric institute (University of Sao Paulo), the Psychiatric Insti-
tute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and, in particular, Sao Paulo
physicians Carol famenein, Bliraldo Carlini, Paulo Fratelli, Elias Hervcionic
and Rafael dc Mclo Alvarcngo. The report, which was delivered to Minister
Faleao and forwarded to Minister Almeida Michado in August 1978, is compre-
hensive. It presents organisational charts for hospital models, proposals

for eonmunity campaigns, plans for radio and television promotions, the costs
of the program and even sources of funds to finance its execution.

According to the text of the legislation establishing the National Drug
Prevention Foundation, the foundation would formulate studies in the field

of public health research on various types of drugs and criminality and causes
of violence amorg the drugged. It would also bring together technicians in
this sector and establish a permanent staff of personnel.

For its part, the National System for Prevention, Supervision and Repression
of Narcotics would coordinate, through a general secretariat of planning, all
the official agencies of the various ministries involved in its end activities,
u'nrl‘yinﬂ out its work projects and programs through them.

Although the studies and proposals elaborated by the interministerial commis-
sion continue to wait for a higher-level decision in the Justice and Health
Ministries, as a result of its research the Braulo Pinto Hospital in Rio de
Janeiro is only waiting for the release of federal funds to put a medical
section in operation, to serve as a parameter [sic] for all the psychiatric
units that will he reformulated and adapted to the directives reeonnended in
the rcports of the task force coordinated by Joan Jose Cary.

ﬂotivntml by Prof Oswald de Andrade and by the government of the state of
Chara, l‘rof Josue de Castro mnaged to move ahead of the Braulo Pinto Hospital

63
and to inaugurate the first center for the recovery of drug addicts in the
country. That institution will promote group meetings with families, to
promptly help detect cases of drug dependency among children, examinihg
school deficiencies, behavioral disturbances, poor social and family adap-
tation and other clinical symptoms that may suggest drug use.

It is also planned to present lectures and seminars of a scientific nature
in the universities, to dewstii‘y conceptions regarding drugs without the
sensationalism common to lay publications. Training for primary and second-
ary teachers is also planned, so information at this level will discourage
children from making their first experiment, which could prove irreversible.

Therefore, from isolated attitudes a body of national conscience is growing
against drug use, waiting for the presidential word of eomand that will
determine the implementation of studies like those conducted by the inter-
miniaterial comission and the draft law and decree creating the National
Water! for Prevention, Supervision and Repression of Drugs and the National
Drug Prevention Foundation. No one believes these angencies to be the defin-
itive solution to a problem that has many variables, that will require time,
that in complex and implies considerable expenditure of public and private
funds, but they represent a beginning and a direction.

STATE CONGRESS ON DRUG'ADDICTION PROBLEMS PLANNED

Culiacan EL SOL DE SINALOA in Spanish 6 Jan 79 p 7

[Text] In connection with the first state meeting for the prevention of
drug addiction. which will take place from 25 to 27 January. the president
of the National Chamber of Commerce. Services and Tourism of Culiacan. Ro-

sendo Flores Esquerra. the manager of that entity. Aaron Irizar Lopez. and
Dr Renato Fidel Guerrero. the organizers of the event. held a press confe-
rence to analyze the program.

They gave an extensive explanation of the main purpose of the meeting. which
will be attended by state. military and federal authorities and members of
several organizations concerned with eliminating this problem that is con-
fronting Culiacan society.

According to the information supplied at the press conference. the state
governor will deliver the opening address. and the topics will be discussed
by high-ranking local state officials. Also in attendance will be the na-
tional supervisor of Youth Rehabilitation Centers. Dr Ignacio Maldonado.

a prominent Argentine psychoanalyst.

ln commenting on the subject. Dr Guerrero said that the event is intended to
make the owners of drug stores. hardware stores and paint shops aware of

the fact that they must not sell toxic products to children. adolescents

or other persons who mlght misuse them in an improper and unfitting manner.

Dr Guerrero said: "It is not that we want to stop the sales. but rather
so as to make them in a suitable fashion with the proper precautions; be-
cause excessive sales cause serious problems owing to the ease with which
these items can be bought.

'ﬁhv results that we accrued from the meetings with princip;ls of schools
2 years ago have proven beneficial. and hence they are still be conducted
with teachers. because they have given us a great deal of assistance.

"Slnce the data obtained from our studies indicate that the disease of drug
addlvlion starts during childhood (the average age being 9 years). we have

52
attempted to attack the probles at that stage; but if the business firms
that we have mentioned previously cooperate with us, the results will be
even better.

"0f the young people that we have been treating for the past 2 years. we
have managed to rehabilitate 23 percent: but we have been greatly amazed
and incredulous to learn that. during the nonths of November and December
and up until this date in January, ‘0 percent of the sane young people have

been rehabilitated in our area. a nunber which we have under cosplete con-
trol.

"in the cosnunity areas. we are pleased to be able to report that there
has been good nental health trcatsent. and this is because of our accos-
plishnents in the areas where the young people gather to becone drugged.
which have been elininsted; and even the civilian population, which did
not pay any heed to those young people previously. is now helping them by
taking them to their homes. so that they will not succumb to the vice."

In response to an express question from a reporter. Dr Guerrero said that
the nunbcr of addicts is the same for both sexes. but that the difference
lies in the fact that the sales do attend the Youth Rehabilitation Center,
whereas the females are more reluctant to do so.

According to Dr Guerrero. and based on the studies that have been made among
the majority of young people when he has sided with his guidance discussions.
the phenoaenon which causes drug addiction is mainly the disintegration of
the Easily. although he did not fail to admit that there other causes. but
noted that they are extremely slight in any event.

[Text] Tijuana-«Yesterday. upon his return from the nation's capital. Dr
Manuel Molina Bellini.director of the Youth Rehabilitation Center (CIJ)
in this town, said that Mexico has more to offer the United States than
that country has to offer ours in the area of prevention and battling
against drug addiction.

The distinguished psychiatrist reported that. while the United States has
been trying for 25 years to prevent and eliminate drug addiction. that
evil has by no aeans declined. but has increased in the United States;
whereas Mexico has made some noteworthy progress against drug addiction.
despite the short tine that it has been using methods to coabat this evil.
The professional remarked: "Hence. we have more to offer the United States
in this field than it has to offer us."

he added that. in view or the foregoing, a binational meeting will be held
during the third week of April in Mexico City, with American and Mexican
experts in the subject. which will be opened by President Jose Lopez-Portillo.
It is aimed at achieving greater rapprochesent between the two countries in
the common tsks of preventing and cosbating durg addiction.

Molina Bellini said that. to date. work programs have been established with
such states as Texas. New Mexico and Arizona; expressing assurance that the
United States will Very shortly do the same in California; while all the
Mexican states on the northern border are participating therein.

The ClJ's director also said that. whereas heroin consulption has dropped

able since I973. and constitutes a serious problem for Mexico and the Unit-
ed Slates. although on a larger scale in the case of the latter country.

Mullua lkdllnl explained that the situation has become worse for the United
States because Tijuana is the main port of entry for these drugs. and since
heroin consumption in this town is down by 80 percent. that volume of drugs

[Text] Two innstes. Msrtiniano Alejandro Nevarez Nevarez and Antonio Qui-
nones Romero. who had been tried and sentenced by the second district court
of antisocial proceedings for crimes against health. were taken out of the
municipal prison "to buy clothing and drink liquor." and escaped fron the
third shift group chief. Jose Olivares Martinez. aged 32. "who is in com-
plete charge of the prison and in theconfidence of Harden Anastasio Delgado."

After the charge node by guard Domingo Macias Romero to the State Judicial
Police headquarters concerning the escape of the two innates at OLOO hours.
the third shift group chief was held in the Judicial Police lockup. so as
to make a statement regarding the escape of Msrtiniano. booked with No
l8999 on 29 January 1975. and of Antonio. with No 19995 on 28 January 1975.

Proceedings No 10/75 had been conducted absinst the pair for crimes against
health. for which the forner was sentenced to 6 years and 3 months in jail

and the paynent of a fine of 6.000 pesos. or another month's imprisonment.

and the latter received a sentence of 7 years and 3 sonths in jail. plus a

fine of 6,000 pesos. or as additional days' imprisonment. The two of then

had 2 more sonths of their sentence to serve.

Yesterday morning. at the State Judicial Police Headquarters. group chief

olivnres Martinez made his statement. admitting that the inmates had been

taken out by him in view of the complete responsibility that he had in the
prison. since the assistant warden. Rodolfo Lozoya was not there. nor did

he show up for work regularly. and because of confidence that Harden Del-

gado had in the inmates. with Msrtiniano serving as a foreman and Quinoaes
in charge of the telephone.

ollvares also told the investigating agents that. "Harden Anastasia Delga-
do had granted two previous permits to Martinisno to leave the prison. and
l was responsible for taking his and bringing him back to jail again. The
first tile. 1 took his to a shop. which I believe was 'Coloso.’ where Mar-
tiniano purchased some shoes. and then asked me to take his to the 'Rana

Verde' Club. where we remained 20 minutes, drinking liquor. and returned to
the prison.

“Two weeks ago. the warden allowed Martiniano to leave in order to buy shirts
in other stores. and I accompanied him. Then he asked me to take him to the
'Tio Sam' Club to drink liquor; and we returned to the prison.

"At about 2600 hours on Saturday night. Martiniano asked me to release him
to drink liquor. but I didn't want to because neither the warden nor his
deputy were present. The innate kept insisting. and I finally agreed. be-
cause of my responsibility in the prison and the fact that the guards could
not notice as at the exit. Antonio Quinones Romero joined us. and we took
him. because he too had the confidence of the warden."

The group chief said that. at the prison gates. "we entered a taxi that we
had previously ordered and went to the 'Onasis' nightclub. where we drank
for over an hour.

"Martiaiann made constant telephone calls. and then told me that 'Mingo'
wanted to talk to me. But while I was talking to the guard. the inmates
disappeared inside the nightclub and fled. I was unarmed. but looked for
them in other nightclubs. but I could not find them. I let some time elapse
before reporting the incident."

The group chief was held by State Judicial Police agents inside of the jail.
Harden Accused
Ciudad Juarez EL FRONTERIZO in Spanish b Jan 79 See A p 3

[Excerpts] There are many deep implications in the escape of the drug traf-
fickers Hartiniano Nevarea Nevarez and Antonio Quinones Romero. because it
has been proven again that there are privileged inmates in the municipal
prison who "do as they please." with the consent of the prison authorities.

The case of this escape assumed some new featuers. since the lower penal
courts were declared incompetent to try the case and. yesterday. Uriel Vil-
legas Raseoa. head of the preliminary investigations department. turned it
over to the agency or the Federal Public Ministry, which will continue the
probe to its conclusion. according to a statement made by Federal Public
Ministry agent Arturo Sanchez Gaytaa.

The statements made by Olivas [sic] Martinez seriously implicated the war-
den of the municipal prison. Anastasio Delgado Astorga. who reportedly had
granted permission for the inmates to go out onto the street.

Upon being interviewed. the prison warden told EL FRONTERIZO that Martini-
anu had for some time been given permission to leave. but that it was to
visit an oculist. because he is blind in one eye. He said: 'This permis-
sion was given to him before I took charge of the prison."

57
In the opinion of the State Judicial Police. there are some deep implications
in this escape. because it is unthinkable that both Hartiniano and Antonio
Quinones should escape when they were to be released In only 1 month. upon
serving the sentences imposed on them for crimes against health.

it should also be pointed out that none of the police are searching for the

escapees. neither the special services agents of the police inspector's of-
fice nor the State Judicial Police.

Federal Public Ministry agent Arturo Sanchez Gaytan told EL FRONTERIZO that
he had received the record of the investigation sent by the preliminary
investigating entity yesterday. It was being completed yesterday so that
those accused of this escape could make their statement; and the prison war-
den. Anastasio Delgado Astorga, will certainly be summoned to testify.

The federal prosecutor stressed the fact that there is a great deal of to-
lerance in the prison. which needs greater vigilance. he also emphasized
that all cases of inmates escaping from the federal jurisdiction must be

turned over to the Federal Public Ministry agency. noting that this is the
first case that has been turned over to it.

Corruption Admitted

Ciudad Juarez EL PRONTERIZO in Spanish 4 Jan 79 See A p 3

[Excerpts] Yesterday, the municipal prison warden. Anastasia Delgado Astorga.
admitted that there is corruption in the jail fostered by the inmates. es-
pecially those convicted of drug trafficking who bribe the guard personnel
with their money; and that this is what has caused the countless escapes.

The prison official also criticized the conduct of the deputy warden of the
prison. Rodolgo Lozoya. whom he claimed not to trust; stating that his un-
reliability was proven by the theft of provisions and escape of Martiniano
Nevarez Nevarez and Antonio Quinones Romero. which occured when he was in
charge of the prison. since he (Delgado) was out of town.

Upon being asked whether he had requested the dismissal of deputy warden
Lozoys. Anastasia Delgado said that he had not. because they would send him
someone worse.

With regard to the corruption that exists among the guards, who are bribed
by the inmates, he said that this situation has existed for a very long
time. and that the guard personnel should be men of good judgment with a
great desire for service. The drug traffickers have found it easy to bribe
the guards.

There is no coordination between the warden and deputy warden of the prison.

but rather open confrontation. which has caused chaos in the vigilance.
something used by the inmates to continue controlling the prison.

statements made by the Jail group chiefs and guards. was trying to smear

the officials in the current municipal administration.

The Federal Public Ministry agency issued warrants for the arrest of all

those implicated in the escape of the drug traffickers Martininno Alejandra
Nevurea Nevarez and Antonio innones Romero.

It is certain that hermllo Gutierrez Bustnmnnte. general inspector of police;

tablish a new method of vigilance and control of the jail population. giv—

ing assurance that "there will be no further bribes. privileges. drinking
and drug trafficker inmates in comand."

sued the writ for official imprisonment of the guards involved in the escape
of the drug trafficker inmates lbrtiniano Alejandro Nevarez Nevarez and An-
tonio Quinonen Romero; and the individuals presumed guilty did not receive

Nuevo Laredo EL MANANA in Spanish 10 Jan 79 Sec 3 p 3

[Text] A few days ago. Manuel Valdez Martinez. son of the notorious drug
trafficker. Manuel Valdez Fernandez, who is at present still a fugitive
from justice, was captured by the Federal Judicial Police. and subsequent-
ly remanded to the_Second District Court as an individual presumed guilty
of committing the crimes of bribery and illegal possession of foreign
goods.

Proceedings No 9-979 were brought against him. and his legal status will
be determined tomorrow.

During the course of the inquiry, the accused admitted part of what he had
previously stated to the Federal Public Ministry.

he admitted owning three rings and three luxurious watches with a total
value of over quarter of a million pesos; these being the cause of the
investigation being made of him.

At the sane time. he denied having any connection with the drug traffic.

Some months ago. Manuel Valdez Fernandez Martinez was captured by the Fe-
deral Judicial Police in compliance with a warrant for his arrest issued
by the second district judge; because in court proceedings he had been
associated with the seizure of over 40 tons of marihuana made by the Fe-
deral Judicial Police in 1975. at several farms near Sabinas Hidalgo.
Nuevo Leon.

On that occasion. Salvador del Toro Rosales and agents under his command
broke up a drug trafficking ring that had been operating on an interna-
tionnl scale. headed by Manuel Valdez Fernandez, who managed to escape
and who. to date. is still a fugitive from justice.

with regard to the present case. the Federal Judicial Police issued a re-

port to the effect that. on 29 December of last year. upon investigating
the drug traffic. they arrested Manuel Valdez Martinez at the "Les Olvidos"

63
(are. since they had infatuation claiming that he was engaged in the pur-
chase and sale of drugs.

Upon being arrested. Vblder Martinez offered three rings with diamond in-
lays and three luxurious watches to the federal agents so as to have the.
investigate his and also allow him to continue his illegal activities.

This prompted the arrest of Valdez Martinez. who said that the jewels of
foreign manufacture found in his possession had been purchased by him in
Guadalajara. Jalisco. and that he knew that they were of foreign origin.

One of the rings. containing a 6.5 karat diamond. was valued at over 90.000
pesos: another at 65.000 pesos and a third at 50,000 pesos.

The second district court reported that Manuel Valdez would not be released
on bail. although he had requested this.

BRIEFS

SEARCK FOR CLANDESTINE RUNWAYs-Tijuana--The general coordinator of the Fe-
deral Public Ministry agencies in the northwestern part of the country.
Carlos Aguilar Garza. stated that a prominent feature of the program to be
carried out this year is intensification of the vigilance and detection of
clandestine landing strips. Aguilar Garza likewise said that the personnel
would be increased in order to exercise greater surveillance in the battle
against drug trafficking. He said that the clandestine runways for_air-
craft landings are a key target in the battle against the drug traffic.
because as they are detected and properly watched, the poisoners of health
can be coubatted to a maximum extent. He remarked that, for greater suc-
acne in this task and in the others incumbent on the Office of the Attor-
ney General of the Republic. there is an obvious need for more personnel;
and he announced that the latter would be going into service as needed,
based upon the express instructions of his superior, Attorney General Oscar
Flores. In conclusion. Aguilar Garza said that the office under his juris-
diction would continue its effort of investigation, remarking that there
are several cases pending, which will be announced in tine when they are
successfully resolved. so as not to interfere with that effort at present.

BADIRAGUATO ShBDS DRUG STIGHA--Badiraguato. Sinaloa. l December--Four years
ago. this part of the state was considered to rank among the strongest from
an economic standpoint. and not exactly because of the exploitation of its
seasonal agriculture. It was recognized as one of the most prominent areas
producing drugs. an activity which made many traffickers wealthy and which
also produced jobs for nearly all of its mountain dwellers, although in an
illegal manner. however, thanks to the effort that the most recent public
administrations have expended to lend dignity to the municipality. which
has been termed "Operation Condor." Badiragusto is nearly free from this
banned activity of harvesting and smuggling drugs. At present. there is
evidence of an atmosphere marked by progress and, for the first time in many
years. agriculture has had its best season; something which clearly reflects
the effort of working people who are seeking self-improvement together.

In other words, Badiraguato has changed radically. and his now showing its
"now face:" a new image which augurs a prosperous. promising future for
the 60,000 inhabitants who comprise the municipality. Generally speaking.
Badiraguato has left its bad image behind. From a town steeped in disgrace
and devoted to growing drugs. it has become a progressive. working town
which is beginning to grow and become consolidated as a dynamic region.

Falsified Prescription For-s
Montevideo EL PAlS in Spanish 5 Dec 78 p 13

lTextl With the arrest of six persons. snong then two woaen. the Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs Brigade has broken up an operation that had been perpe-
trated for several weeks by several drug addicts. who had been forging
dozens of prescriptions produced in a downtown print shop in order to obtain
drugs.

The owner of the print shop. who said he had printed over a dozen packets of
prescription fares for one of the suspects. added that he was aware of their
illegal use. 0n the other hand the rest of the suspects are all well known
to the men of the Narcotics Brigade. The leader of the operation had been
imprisoned twice before along with two of his cronies. The women had been
coluitted for psychiatric treatment.

It should be noted that the detectives of the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
Brigade had for several weeks spotted the presence of a larger than usual
quantity of prescriptions in triplicate here. of the kind issued by the
_various services of the Ministry of Public health. At the same time they
found in checking back that there were certain disparities in the type
fares used. and reached the conclusion that they were dealing with s forgery.
Innedlately. they run a check of the files of all addicts and traffickers
known to have forged prescriptions. thus narrowing the nu-ber of suspects.
Although the task was not easy. they finally arrested one of then. who.
after stubborn resistance. adaitted having ordered the prescription forms
from a downtown print shop. Neverthelesa.--with the confession of the
leader serured--it was no great chore to apprehend his accosplices. in-
cluding the printer. They were all brought before Dr Juan Carlos Larrieux.
presiding judge of the Second Session for a hearing.

[umpire the usual silence saintslned by the heads of the Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs Brigade. it was learned that the head of this gang had
been arraigned on 27 July of last year for "sellirg narcotics." and for
"using a false identity card." and on 27 February of this year for "forging
on identity document." This tiae. in addition to the forgery and the sale

70
of narcotics. he was also churned with possession ur two identity rards
belonging to otheru which he need to buy restricted nrdlclnen in different

Today the six suspects will again he hronght before the presiding judge,

who will probably pass judgment on the situation of all or them and pro-
nonnce the respective sentences.

Prosecutions, Psychiatric Treatment

Montevideo EL DlA in Spanish 6 Dec 78 p 8

[Text] A new operation of the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Brigade of the
National Bureau of Information and Intelligence has concluded with two
apprehensions and three commitments for psychiatric treatment.

In a battle without ietup to eradicate the scourge of drug addiction from
our society. the above-cited police organization has succeeded in uncovering
the activities of two youths. both with criminal records. who were once
again sent to prison. They were engaged inobtainingpsychopharmaceuticals--
which are tightly controlled-—through false prescriptions.

The prisoners are: Alvaro Rosella Otero, married and 21 years of age, in-
voived in the crimes of "selling narcotics" (Article 35 of Law 16,296),
and "forging a personal document." (This is the third charge brought
against him recently.) Fernando Grana Vescovi, Uruguayan. single. 21
years old. arrested for the second time. this time for "forging a personal
document."

Forgery of Prescriptions

Rosello and Grana succeeded in having printed at least six books of pres-
cription forms with 50 prescriptions to a book, in a print shop in Ciudad
Vieja. located on Alzabar Street.

The format of the prescriptions calls for an original and two copies in
order that it can he issued in triplicate. The printing can only be ordered
by the Ministry of Public Health and never by individuals.

Yesterday the police brought the two suspects, the print shop owner, and
three others who were users before the magistrate. The latter are not

antidrnu treatment.

Regarding the printer: he stated to the judge that he did not know what
the prescription forms were for or anything about the activities of Roselle
and Hrana, and for this reason the judge did not order his arraignment.

71
cluen for the luvustinnlion

It should he stated that several weeks ago ufficials of the Narcotics and
Dungernus Drugs Brigade had discovered that there was a large number of
prescriptions in this are" that were in sunn respects different from
authentic nnos with regard to type faces. Confronted with evidence of
wrongdoing. they made a check of the files of all traffickers and addicts
with forgery records, and this led to the arrest of the principal figure
invnlved.

The leader, Alvero Rosella, had been booked in July of last year for "selling
drugs" and "uaing a stolen document.“ and in February of this year for
"forgery of a personal document."

TRAFFICKING ROUTES, DRUG USE DISCUSSED
Caracas ULTIMAS NOTIC [AS in Spanish 29 Jan 79 pp 46-65

IArticlc by Jose Luis Olivares]

[Text] Venezuela is reported to be the "spearhead" for introduction of
drugs into the United States by the Mafia, according to the investigations
being carried out by the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) with the coopera-
tion of INTERPOL, following the arrests of several international drug
traffickers in our country.

The Venezuelan police believe that the vice gang is using the Colombia-
Venezuela-United States route to ship drugs in the pure state to that
large northern country, where the product is processed and marketed.

The strict checking of citizens coming from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia by
the U.S. authorities has forced drug traffickers to seek new routes for
bringing the drug into the United States.

Large centers for the production and processing of drugs are located in
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, for which reason all travelers coming from
these countries into U. S. territory are subject to special processing by
the police.

U.S. engineer Roberto Lee Cooper, 28, told the PTJ that he was traveling
to the United States from Bolivia, shortly after having been arrested by
a team of agents from this police body in possession of two double-bottomed
suitcases within which cocaine valued at 10 million bolivares was hidden.

INTERPOL also intercepted two suitcases containing marijuana valued at
a million bolivarcs which had been sent by air from Colombia to Venezuela.
INTERPDL agents informed the Colombian authorities and a lady was arrested

at the HI Durado Airport, after the iniormation received from Caracas had
mum pnnwsme

Three hundred twenty-six cakes of marijuana and 10 ampules of cocaine
wviuhinn 20 grams each were seized by the PAC [Armed Forces of National

78
Cooperation] in the tunnel section of the Tulo highway and in the excise
tax ufficv in Puertu (hhello.

Tho seizure in Tule came about when a yellow stake-body truck with license
plates VCD 175 was stopped. The driver took flight.

The driver of a stake-body truck named Melquiadcs Luis Parra, a Venezuelan,
single, and a mechanic by profession, was arrested in the tunnel, and in
the truck the military found 204 cakes of marijuana.

In both cases, the marijuana was concealed in plastic envelopes manufactured
in Colombia.

Consumers

The investigation pursued by tho PTJ and INTERPOL reveals that Venezuela
is a country in which large quantities of drugs, ospecially marijuana, are
consumed, but apparently there is no drug production or processing center
here, for which reason the police do not believe that the drugs seized

from the international traffickers were intended to supply the domestic
markvt.

It is also known that heroin consumption has increased in this country.

PTJ ARRESTS INTERNATIONAL COCAINE TRAFFICKBR
Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 27 Jan 79 p 30

[Text] The Judicial Technical Police, working closely with the services
of INTERPOL, have seized 10 kilograms of smuggled cocaine, estimated to
be worth more than 10 million bolivares, being brought into our country
in two double-bottomed suitcases by a presumed international trafficker

in drugs identified as Robert Lee Cooper, born in the United States of
America. '

This report was released yesterday by the director of the Judicial
Technical Police, Dr Pedro Torres Agudo, at a press conference, during which
he said that the American, a native of Massachusetts, also had in his

position samples of hashish, marijuana and other drugs. as well as $5,000
in cash for use in his transactions.

Pedro Torres Agudo introduced the head of his drug division, Commissioner
Vicente Silva Paloma, who said that on the basis of an investigation pur-
sued, Robert Lee Cooper was arrested when he arrived at the Maiquetia
International Airport and crossed the international boundary, obtaining
the stamp allowing him to enter Venezuela.

"He came from Bolivia, and was possibly using our country as a transit
zone, since apparently his destination was Canada, from which he would
travel to the city of Boston in the U.S."

[Question] Does Robert Lee Cooper have an international record as a drug
traffickur?

lAuswvrI l think it is too soon to know this, since we have just arrested
him, and we are in touch with other countries through INTERPOL in Caracas

with a view to obtaining details concerning the possible record Cooper
has .

Ianstion] what was seized apart from cocaine?
lAnswer] A collection of samples including the various types of cocaine,
hashish, marijuana and heroin was taken from him. These samples were sub-
jected to testing in our laboratories, with positive results. which
indicates that he is a veteran trafficker.

Dr Pedro Torres Aguda then took over to state that the cocaine seized is

of a high degree of purity, estimated at 92 percent, and that also $5,000
which the presumed drug trafficket had on his person was also seized.

DRUG SITUATION-~Drug crimes were marked by a rising tendency in 1978 des-
pite the internationally recognized successes of the Austrian security
authorities in combating them. Some 2,940 people had to be reported
under the drug act. The figures had been 2,609 for 1977 and 2,211 for 1976.
The number of drug deaths rose by S to 23 last year compared with 18 in
1977. This is what Interior Minister Lane stated at a press conference
today. Figures clearly reflect the problem that confronts the "drug
transit country" of Austria. Last year 900 kg of cannabis and 7.000 kg
of cannabis resin were seized. The figures were 592 and 859 respectively
in 1977. Whereas Austria occupies a top place in the cannabis sector,
the feared "hard drugs" hardly play any role. [Vienna HIENER ZEITUNC

[Article by Hans Hiig: "Narcotics Police Pound Heroin Stored in Farevejle“]

[Text] In closed constitutional hearings two men have received prison sen-
tences in connection with a new large heroin case. Similar to other large
cases in the last year, police uncovered quantities of narcotics stored
"out in the country" some distance from Copenhagen, where the drugs were
sold.

One of the accomplices in the case was sent to prison last week and the
prisoners supposedly have pleaded guilty to some of the charges, which on
Monday enabled the narcotics department to uncover narcotics stored in
Parevejle north of Holbak.

Found Herein and Honey

here they arrested the 34-year old decorator Hogens Christiansen in his
home and police found large quantities of strong heroin four--of rather
poor quality, however--together with Danish and foreign money. Christiansen
says he is not guilty of smuggling and selling narcotics, according to the
statutes of criminal law. Generally speaking, he has refused to talk to
police. Yesterday he was sentenced to 4 weeks in prison by the judge on
duty.

"1 cannot talk about the particulars in this case because there are several
accomplices still at large, bUL we expect this will be a large case," says
Police Inspector P. Caugin.

The charges include smuggling and selling both hashish and heroin worth
millions. The drug addict pays the street vendor about 1200 kroner per
gram of heroin. It is not unusual for u drug addict to use narcotics
worth 1000 to 2000 kroner a day.

Hethodon Physician Before the Supreme Court

This tragic fact is revealed in a discussion surrounding physician Ole
Hjortos, who has now been barred from treating drug addicts with methadon.
To emphasize the seriousness of the problem, the doctor last fall ex-
plained that one of his clients had stolen treasures from the Royal Library
worth 10 million kroner.

Upon hearing this, police demanded that the doctor hand over the patient's
records and the Supreme Court is now taking a stand on this demand. Yester-
day the Minister of Justice, Nathalie Lind, allowed the Director of Public
Prosecutions to bring the case before the Supreme Court. The Copenhagen
minicipal court ordered the doctor to expose the patient because of the
unplications of a serious crime. The high Court overturned the ruling,
upholding the doctor's right to withhold confidential information.

DRln USE SEEN INCREASIN AGAIN
Paris 11-: Homo in French 15 Jan 79 P 8
[Article by (initials illegible): "Drug Use in France: A Sharp Rise")

[Text] Although drugs are no longer a front page story in the media, their

use continues to increase in France. The figures for 1978, which have Just

been published by the Ministry of the Interior, in fact, show an unexpected

increase, 60 percent over 1977. Even if it err. be argued that police tech-

niques have improved and that, consequently, the police are more likely than
in the past to identify addicts, the number of drug arrests during the past

year (7,300) shows a sharp rise compared to 1977 (approximately h,000).

The 109 deaths attributed officially to drugs in 1978, without counting the
unofficial figures, which are alwa 5 important in this area, show an increase
of 6'3 percent as compared to 1977 72 cases reported) while our indicator,
the number of cases of thefts of drugs from harmacies by addicts looking
for dr n, has also increased by 60 percent l,0‘+2 pharmacies burglarized

in 1978 .

In 20 percent of the cases heroin is involved: in 10 percent there are
amphetamines, which are very dangerous, and more and more often we find that
heroin dealer: also deal in hashish, which is the most widespread drug (60
percent of the traffic). This means an increase in the danger of having
adolescents: who use hashish "pointed" towards the major addiction, the most
profitable one for the dealers at every leVel (a gram of Thai heroin currently
:znilr. for 1,000 francs in Paris). France now has, according to estimtes of
Mir mrcotion division, from 30,000 to 50,000 drug users and it is feared that
army of them will become addicts. Another disturbing fact is that drug use is
no [miner limi ted to the youth of the professional class and has spread to
segments of the population living in the suburban and rural areas, where for a
10m time they pro never seen. The report which was presented in January 1978
hy Monique Pelletier had shown this development. Last year, this tendency
became no noticeable that some local governments launched strong local anti-
how to reach the younu. The fact that addiction is now totalLv free of the
post-1968 folklore makes it all the more difficult to uncover.

Therapy Groups

What can be asked, howwer, is vheth'r these "comprchcnsiVe" approaches
established by the medical and Judicial authorities have not fizzled, result-
ing only in maintaining the addiction of the drug users, in the absence of a
real. desire to give it up. In the United States, there has been an increase
in the number of therapy groups, along the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous, in
which there is very strict discipline and the emphasis is placed on reinte-
gration into real society more than on always doubtml solution of personal

relations problems .

In France, schral efforts are nov being made, but on too small a scale to
haVe any effect.

Another disturbing phenomenon: is the develomont of alcoholism among the
younguof the use of medications serving at times as "potentializerr." increas-
ing the effects and combining this form of alcoholism with drug addiction.

0n the analysis of the psychological and social causes of this situation,
there is an abundant literature. And as for the measures to be taken to
combat the problem, nothing seems to hold as much promise as the efforts

already being made by the police. '
POLICE SEIZB RECORD CACHF 0F COCAINE

Stockholm SVEﬂSKA DAGBIADET in Swedish 17 Jan 79 p 5
[Article by Claes von nofsten: "Largest Cocaine Cache a Caution Signal"]

[Text] The largest cocaine confiscation ever in Sweden was nade by the
national police's narcotics squad in Stockholl. A man was arrested one
evening last week outside the Liljeholoen subway station. In his bag. 1.5
kilograms of cocaine were found.

For many years. narcotics police have feared the spread of cocaine in Sweden.
in the United States. cocaine is the new "in drug." and so far, Sweden has
always followed in the Americans' footsteps. even if there is a certain lag.

"we knew it was in the works. Now and again during the past year we have
received tips concerning cocaine. but they have only led to Iinor caches."
says Connissioner Augustson. head of the narcotics squad.

During 1978. a total of ll confiscations of cocaine were Isde in Sweden. In
these cases, a total of 736 grams were taken. For the preceding year. not
one confiscation involving cocaine is found in the statistics.

"in-Groups"

1he big problem for police with respect to cocaine is the difficulty in
carrying out surveillance. So far. cocaine is used exclusively within
closed in-groups. Police surveillance has difficulty penetrating then.

"we haVe not found a single capsule among the drug users at Sergels Tbrg
Square. Our best chance is to hit the larger transporters. like last week."
says Augustson.

The arrest at the Liljeholmen subway station was no coincidence. The 33-year
old South A-erivan was one of several subjects of great interest to narcotics
police.
Two days later. a second South American was apprehended. This occurred at
the "City" section of town. At the time. he had 200 grams of cocaine in his
possession. The man claims to have just found it on the subway, jammed be-
tween saith. The man denies having comitted any crime.

q

Shipment Prom Bolivia

Thin man is suspected of seVecal cases of cocaine smuggling. His passport
indicates that he traVeled between South America and Sweden three times
during 1978. Tuesdav. the man was arraigned.

The man who was apprehended at Liljeholmen. as opposed to the other one. has
confessed. His economic situation was quite bad and to improve it, he
traveled to Bolivia to purchase cocaine. For 25.000 kronor. he received the
[.5 kilogram shipment.‘ he. in turn. had planned to sell it to dealers for
around half a million kronor. In the final sale. police estimate the ship-
ment to he worth around a million kronor.

Commissioner Augustson believes the pricing of cocaine in Sweden is a little
unusual. Elsewhere in the world where cocaine has already gained a good
foothold, cocaine costs twice as much as heroin. In Sweden. the price
situation is the reverse.

"This is a deliberate marketing technique. Once cocaine is established.
the price will rise sharply." Augustson believes.

Attracts New Groups

"we must also warn people about cocaine. It is at least as dangerous as
heroin."

Cocaine is threatening to attract new groups toward abuse. While heroin
is injected. needles are needed. and it easily becomes messy. cocaine is
snorted. This has caused cocaine to be viewed as "more refined." In cer-
tain circles. it has almost become socially acceptable.

Cocaine comes mainly from South America. The raw material is the cocaine
hush. which grows on the slopes or the Andes. In the western world. cocaine
was Introduced in medicine in the mid-19th century. Hhen the drink Coca
(kﬂa came out at the end of the 19th century. it contained cocaine as a
stimulant. but [this formula] was banned as early as 1903.
