Marathon Search Pays off
hang Kong 800T" CthA MORNING POST in English 26 Oct 78 p 9

[Text] Customs officers yesterday seized sore than 2 lbs of No 3 heroin.
worth about 8100.000. after a 15-hour search of the Panamanian vessel.
Tai Chung Shan.

Since 1975. drugs have been found on the ship sore than 60 tines.

No one has been arrested in connection with yesterday's seizure but sore
than 30 officers were last night still searching the 3.085-ton freighter.

According to Superintendent F. Greenhalgh of the Custos and Excise Serv-

ice. officers began searching the vessel late last night shortly after it
arrived free Bangkok.

he said the drugs are believed to have been imported fro. Thailand and
they appear to be good quality.

Ship Owners Express Shane
hong Kong SOUTH CﬂlNA HORNING POST in English 1 Dec 78 p 15

[Text] The owners of the freighter Tai Chung Shan. which has been found
carrying drugs on 66 occasions during the past seven years. yesterday said
they were "ashaned" of the record.

An assistant manager with the Shun Cheong Navigation Coapsny. Hr Ji-ny
Chan. said. ”Re have tried our best to stop it and we've even sent out
circulars warning the crew about snuggling drugs--but it is beyond our
control."

The ship. which shuttles regularly between Bangkok and Hong Kong. was
reported in the Legislative Council on Hednesday as having carried
dangerous drugs repeatedly since l976.
The Secretary for Security. Mi Lewis Daves. told council members that
stricter laws would be introduced to deal with those responsible for
the smuggling of drugs in ocean-going Vessels.

"The Action Cousittee Against Narcotics has endorsed a proposal that an
amendment to the law should be made which would enable fines to be is-
posed on the captains. masters and owners of ocean-going vessels on
which dangerous drugs have been repeatedly found." Mr Lewis said.

Mr Chan refused to coament on the legislation but said the only way to
cut down on the nunber of seisureswas for the Customs and Excise Depart-

ment to step up searches of ships so as to make drug smuggling not worth-
"htlca

The Sham Cheong Navigation Company recently replaced its Chinese crew
with Filipinos but Mr Chan denied that the reason for the switch was to
reduce the drug trafficking.

He said it was because the Filipinos were "nore obedient and good workers."

The President of the Hong Kong Shipowners Executive Club. Mr Frank Chao.
said he did not think it fair that under the proposed legislation owners
should be penalised.

“The owners do not have control over their crews. If a syndicated crew
was paid to traffic in drugs it would be very difficult for the owner to
do anything.

"But if the owner is guilty of dealing in drugs, he aust certainly be
penalised," he said.

Mr Chao. who is also president of "ah Kwong and Co.. said that in his
past 23 years in shipping he has never encountered any drug smuggling.

He also eaid drugs have never been found on board his company's 59 ships.
"It all depends on how strict your company and supervisor is regarding
drugs, and also your captain and crew. Touch wood we have never had any
found on board our ships," he said.

Hr Chao said a regular crew often takes advantage of illegal activities.
"They always behave well and don't argue for more money. They're the
ones that are most difficult to track down because it's the big money
that attracts them to the drug trade."

The Customs and Excise Department senior superintendent. Operations.

Mr Halter Neil, said the proposed legislation was brought about because
"something was needed to try to prevent drug smuggling.”

26
., -l u.

He called the new measures a prevention and deterrent. and added that
when the legislation does get to the Executive Council it might only
involve the letters and not the ounere of the ship.

0n the beeie of the reeulte of the inveatigation eede by Federal Judicial Fo-
lice agente and the queetioning of the preeunebly guilty individuele conduct-
ed by Federal Public Ministry Agent Oecar Felipe Caatro San Martin, it was
learned that Fnrique mntalvo Alaodover and hie co-on-law wife. Azalia Ro-
driguez arrived in Hexicali on 6 Meier and took lodging in a hotel.

63
They arrived in a 1975 Chevrolet pickup truck with California license plates.
The first thing that they did upon becoming settled in their hotel room was
to cell the telephone nunber 4-26-97. in San Luis-Rio Colorado, and contact

Reynaldo Franklin feralta, who arranged a meeting with them at which heroin
would be sold to them.

That sane afternoon. they wont to the neighboring Sonoran town and waited at
Reynaldo Franklin's house until 2300 hours at night for the nesting. Enrique
Montslvo end Reynaldo Franklin weited for the presumed owner of the drugs

(who is a fugitive and whose identity was not disclosed). with two other
individuals. one of whom was Jose Evaristo Rrias.

The Puerto Rican and the person who had just arrived went to the latter's
house to see the drugs and to conclude the deal. They agreed that Enrique
Hontalvo would buy then for $38,000 per kilogram. and sell the. to hie pur-
chaser for $65,000 per kilogram.

when the deal was made, Enrique Montalvo took the drugs and they returned to
Reynaldo Franklin's house. where the fugitive told them that Jose Ewaristo
Fries had been assigned to acconpsny them the entire time until the transac-
tion took place. when he would receive $81,636 for taking them to the one
who acted as "chief."

Enrique Hontalvo then said that he had a customer for the drugs. and would
receive $A5.000 per kilogran: whereupon Reynaldo Franklin received $1,000
in payment for his hospitality and for acting as a contact.

Enrique and Reynaldo bought a few rolls of adhesive tape at 0800 hours in
the morning, with which they sealed the packages of heroin. when they had
been fastened, they all returned to Mexicali. Enrique and Aaalia in their
1975 Chevrolet pickup truck. and the others in Reynaldo's car. Upon arriv-
ing in this town. they again took lodging in the same hotel. where the two
wonen remained. Enrique Hontalvo, Jose Evaristo Prias and Reynaldo Franklin
left the hotel and headed for the international border.

The first two crossed the border in the Puerto Rican's pickup truck. and
went to the Holiday Inn hotel at El Centre, where they let "Jillie," an in-
dividual who concluded the deal for $65,000 per kilogram, which they gave
him. The two traffickers returned to Calexico and, at a service station
there. the pickup was left for maintenance work. Jose Evaristo Fries remain-
ed there. waiting for Enrique Hontalvo to return with the keys to the pickup
which were a guarantee that he would not leave. Enrique Hontalvo crossed
the border on foot, and net Ray-undo Franklin. who took him to his hotel

to pick up the drugs. After spending awhile in the room. Ray-undo and his
wife Isidore left, entered their car and later talked to the Puerto Ricans.
telling the. that they would welt for then downstairs.
The Arrests Begin

when Inynundo and Isidora left the hotel race, they were followed by federal
Judicial Police agents. Meanwhile, other agents arrived at the room and
caught the tuo foreigners with the seven packages of herein in their posses-
sion. Just when they had found the drugs in the bureau drawer. the telephone
rang. It was Ray-undo. telling Enrique that he was waiting for him downstairs.
They aade no contact until they net in the custody of the federal agents.

Me Became Desperate

Jose lvariato Fries began to becose nervous when 1600 hours arrived (the tine
arranged for anrique Mantalvo to return with the drugs iron the service station
where they had left the pickup truck). and the foreigner had not arrived.

He waited awhile longer. and decided to go to the hotel. thinking that one
of two things could have gone wrong: 0n the one hand. that there might have
been probleaa with the authorities; and. on the other. that Enrique Montalvo
might have played a "trick" on his and escaped with the drugs. If this were
the case, what story would he tell his chief?

He crossed the border to Mexicali on foot, and was captured by agents of the
Federal Judicial Police.

Reasnded
Oscar Felipe Castro San Martin. agent of the Federal Public Ministry. said

that he would remand then to the judge on duty in the penal court of the
first instance that would act on behalf of the district court. on charges of

crises against health.

tions involving the purchase and sale of drugs.

found the aforementioned "powder.” when Henchaca Galvan was arrested and

questioned. he confessed that the powder was a drug, and that its owner was
Fsson barriga Fujol. which pronpted the latter's arrest.

gens were confiscated fro- Barriga Fujol. as wall as $5,835 and 113.339 pesos

Charges Denied
Nuevo Laredo EL MARANA in Spanish 25 Nov 78 Sec 3 p 3

[Text] Yesterday, the businessman Ramon Barriga PuJol appeared before the
second district judge to make his preliminary statement. claiming that he
had nothing to do with the dose of cocaine which the Pederal Judicial Police
seized in the accused‘s apartment. located in the "El Taniko" business ee-
tablishment in the red-light district.

Barriga Pujol has consistently claimed to be innocent of the charges brought
agaizzt his. as well as of any connection with the case in which he is in-
vol .

Yesterday, advised by Alberto Pinto Arreola, the accused made hie statement.
confirming hie previous deposition to the Pederal Judicial Police and the
social representative to the effect that he is not the owner of the cocaine
related to the case. and that he furthermore does not know to whom it belongs.

At the petition of the defendant's attorney. testiaony was taken in court
from the manager of "El Tamiko." Jesus henchaca Galvan, and from chasbermaid
Prancieca Arevalo Hontee.

The former stated that he often used Hr Barriga Pujols‘ apartment, renting
or lending it to business customers or friends, without his boss's permission.
noting that the letter was unaware of these irregularities.

Hencheca Galvan added that he was not a witness when the Federal Judicial Po-
lice found the envelope containing cocaine in Barriga Pujol'e apartment.

Henchaca's testimony was reaffirmed by Mrs Arevalo Hontes, who said that on
many occasions she knew that friends of the establishment's manager occupied
theapartnentof its owner, Ramon Barriga without his knowledge.

Based on the evidence provided by the Federal Public Ministry and the existing
proof. the judge will decide tomorrow on the legal status of Barriga Pujol.
who has at all times denied being involved in drug trafficking.

Suspect Released
Nuevo Laredo EL NANANA in Spanish 26 Nov 78 Sec 3 p 2

[Text] Yesterday. the well-known businessman Ramon Barriga Pujol was released
with legal reservations for lack of sufficient evidence with which to be
tried. according to a decision made by the second district judge. Luis Garcia
Romero.

harriga Pujol was accused by the Federal Public Ministry of being presuuably
guilty of committing a crime against health in the degree of cocaine posses-
sion.

67
in a heated court battle, Alberto Pinto Arreole succeeded in deaonstreting.
with proof of exoneration as well as testisony from two witnesses that his
client was not associated with the charges brought against him by the social
representative; and, therefore. the accused regained his liberty.

According to the decision of Garcia Innero. it was not believed that narriga
Pujol had the drug related to the case under his control or available to his.
inassuch ae‘the apartment in which the cocaine was allegedly found had been
occupied by one of the employees of the accused who, in turn. rented or mode
it availabls'to various individuals.

Despite the fact that Barriga Pujol had reserved the apartment for hiseelf
and his wife. individuals unknown to his had occupied it; free which it was
logically inferred that the drug could have been concealed by any of the per-
sons to when the business nsnager wade the apartment available. and not ne-
cessarily the accused.

It say be recalled that Berriga Pujol was arrested a few days ago by agents
of the PEdersl Judicial Police. who searched the business establish-ant known
as "81 Taniho." of which he is the owner, where they found an envelope con-
taining a dose of cocaine.

Barriga Pujol consistently denied any connection with that drug. and at the
ease tine claised that he had never been involved in drug trafficking.

Later. when Barriga appeared before the second district judge to make his pre-
lininnry state-ant. he continued to deny the charges brought against him.

At the petition of his defender. Alberto Pinto Arreola. testisony was taken
from Jesus Henehsca Galvan and Franciecs Arevslo Montes. both of when are
eeployees of Barrige Pujol. They reaffirsed the fact that the apartment in
which the Federal Judicial Police had discovered the cocaine was often oc-

cupied by a great usny individuals.

[fext] Almst a score of persons, mostly minor children of both sexes, are
under investigation by agents of the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Brigade
because of presumed links with trafficking and oonsuption of hallucinogenics
and mind-altering drugs as well as the falsification of prescriptions.

Included among the arrested persons is the proprietor of a drugstore,
accused by various drug users of providing them with the substances in
question, which in sous cases were confiscated by the agents operating
in various cases to date.

For some time the agents of the above-mentioned department of the National
Directorate of Informtion and Intelligence had centered their attention on

a group of young drug addicts, expecting to learn where they were obtaining
the restricted drugs (anphetanines and psychotropic substances) and possibly
marihuana. At last the arrests began when clues were found which promise
further results in this delicate investigatio . According to informtion now
available. 17 persons are in police custody, and it is believed that tunorrw
they will begin to enter pleas before the respective courts, assuning that
by then it will be possible to coaplete further actions ordered by the
Magistrate who has jurisdiction as well as to dismiss charges against those
who can demonstrate they had no connection with the offenses under investiga-

In cases of serious involvement with drug trafficking, a crime regulated by
Articles 34, 35 and 36 of the January 1975 law (Nmber 14294), such persons
will be kept in custody during the trial because they are addicts also.

Sources in the narcotics unit consulted last night by El. PAIS confirmed only
that they are working on the case and declined to make any other cement,

confidential, as is to be expected until the court hearings are held.

DRUG ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS INTERVIEHED 0N CURRENT ACTIVITY
Riyadh Ab-RIYAD in Arabic 26 Nov 76 p 3

(Article: "A Raging Battle Against Drugs Utilizing Modern Detection and
Investigative Equip-eat and Available Technical and Nolan Capabilities“]

[Text] The war agath drugs is neither new nor a sur-
prise. but began when drugs startad to invade this
country, as they did other countries of the world.
through travelers and the travel movement.

what is new about this war is that it has becone
active now, its scope expanded. and is arned with the
nest sodern equip-eat and with technical and Mean
capabilities as this international, dangerous'disease
has spread.

As such. recently an independent Drug Enforce-en:

Agency was created and was directly linked to his

excellency the sinister of the interior.
Drugs...that octopus which has frightened the world.

The peoples and govern-cuts of nations began searching for solutions. Now
can we stop this bleeding. a financial and noral bleeding.

Loud shouts are thundering all over the world.

They shout, stop using drugs.

here is America spending $60 nillion during the first part of the 20th century
for anti-alcohol advertise-ems; a sun that was huge at that tine.

Ten million pages [about alcoholisn] were published in the newspapers and

books. and [in the fore] of articles and pictures. The loss to the Anerican
national intone from alcoholisn was $250 nillion; 300 persons convicted of

710
alcohol related crimes were executed, 532.335 alcoholics were jailed. fines
against prohibition laws violators were $16 million, and the value of the

confiscated property of alcoholics an a punishment for their habit was
360‘ I‘lllono

This battle within the American society continued for lb consecutive years.
This is one side of the picture.

He find the other side [of the picture] in Britain where the minister of
social affairs warned his people, giving them statistics about the extent and
influence of drugs for the past 20 years. He asserted that alcoholism con-
victions have twice doubled and are now 50,000 casesii Also. work related
problems have doubled where there are alcoholic workers.

He pointed out that analytic scientific studies have confirmed [the relation-
ship] of violence [to drugs] whereby the numbers of drug related crimes have
increased.

Also [increased are] the burdens upon health services, doctors. the police,
judges and family welfare services.

These are the bells of danger tolling in these countries...tolling by the
hands of their officials. isn't God merciful towards his Hoslem worshippers?

disease.

As a contribution of AL°RIYAD in this human concern, it met with Haj 'Abd sl-
Rahman Jum'ah. director of the Drug Enforcement Agency. Regarding this agen-
cy and its goals. he said:

Drugs in Saudi Arabia first appeared in small quantities during the 1950's,
and the punishment for possession was very minor (punishment was left up to
Judicial determination). when the government began to sense the danger of
drugs to the citizens, it began to combat them. in 1380 [hijrs], snail
squads were created to combat drugs and they were attached to General Inves-
tigations. This association was terminated on 1 July 1392 [hijra] and was
transferred to Public Security until 16 October 1398 [hijra] when it was
separated by a decree from the minister of interior and placed under his
supervision and that of his deputy.

As a result of Saudis' traveling abroad and due to the increasing number of
visitors to the kingdom, at the same time. a major development took place
as this association revealed the availability of a variety of drugs to
Saudi citizens and visitors. This situation had to be confronted firmly
and with effective efforts by the concerned organizations in order to put a
step to it or to reduce it.

75
[Question] What equipment is being utilized in drug enforcement?

[Answer] The most recent equipment reaching us are lie detectors. and also
the use of trained dogs in drug detection. These dogs act as guides and
finders for the trainer. and regardless of whether or not the drugs are on
the person of the suspect. buried in sand or otherwise.

There is other equipment that assists in detection and investigation. all of
which is taodern. This. in addition to finger printing. labs and close-up
and telephoto photography. Re are now studying the ides of using finger
prints in locating drugs. If we succeed in this plan, the kingdom will be-
come the first to have revealed this process.

As for the human elenent, there are workshop sessions in Egypt and other
nations of the world. to which we send employees to specialise in drug en-
forcement and to train. He continue, however, to develop, at the same tine,
the human and technical aspects.

[Question] On what basis is the penalty for drug use and sale determined?

[Answar] The government, aay God assist it. is fully concerned about pro-
tecting its citizens against the dangers and adverse habits practiced by
others. Drugs are being col-bated by non-Hoslem nations and by atheistic
nations. Au; a matter of priority, the government is concerned about its
citizens and the sanctity of this nation, and as such, it increased the nor-
mal penalties, past and present, for as the gravity of the crime increases
so does the penalty. for it increases and becomes more severe.

[Question] What are the types of penalties?

[Answer] No years in jail for the user; 5 years in jail and a fine of 15.000
riyals for the middle-man and the seller; and 15 years in jail and a fine

of 20,000 riyals for the smuggler. These penalties apply to all for. of
drugs, and it is up to the judge or the religious court to supplement these
penalties with public flogging as they see fit in a manner that will insure
justice and righteousness.

[Question] who are the major users and to what social stratum do they be-
long?

[Answer] Assimilation, travel. association and emulation have resulted in
any problems. As such, drugs, especially in the form of (pills and capsules).
have been confiscated from various social strata.

[Question] What danger do visitors pose in the spread of drugs?

[Answer] Some visitors belong to countries where drugs are abundant, and

in some of these countries drug penalties are minor. As such these individ-
uals come to the kingdom and are either addicts or are hoping to realize a

76
quick fortune through the sale of drugs. Herein lies the true danger. for
sany of these individuals mix and associate with the Saudi citizens. which
could result in the exchange [of drugs] and the addiction of the citizens to
these haraful and alien customs.

[Question] is there any cooperation with the law enforcement agencies from
where these visitors cone?

[Answer] Yes. and during several conferences such cooperation among parti-
cipating nations was recommended. especially cooperation along neighboring
states. Here we point out the meeting between His Excellency Emir Nayif ibn
'Abd al-‘Aziz. sinister of interior. and Mr Sulayaan ‘Arar. the Jordanian
sinister of interior, who asserted close cooperation in this area.

Cooperation also exists with the Arab Egyptian Republic to the extent that
the Drug Enforcement Agency has been able to pursue a ring of saugglers be-
tween Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia and whose final destination was

Egypt.

The episode began when the Agency received information that a gang of smug-
glers intended to snuggle large quantities of drugs to Egypt. The Agency
then followed from the start the steps and movements of the gang until the
gang obtained a car designed according to their specifications which was
loaded with drugs in Beirut while being watched by agents of the Agency.

The loading was completed in Jordan before the car entered Saudi Arabia.

Our agents were asked not to interfere, and the ssugglers reached the Jid-
dsh port. At the port Agency agents were watching a Ian whose job was to
follow the car until it has been shipped. he did not leave the port until
he was certain that the ship had started on its way. He then left for Cairo
to inforu the saugglers. I myself joined in the planning and execution, and
I was following the developments in Cairo with Egyptian officials. The car
was confiscated on the outskirts of Cairo.

[Question] Now that we have the pilgriaage season, is there an increased
danger resulting from the large increase in the numbers of visitors to the
kingdom?

[Answer] Sale of the visitors come for the pilgrimage or as visitors, but
in reality this is a cover for their real purpose, which is to sell their
harmful cosnodities. A few weeks ago 95,000 capsules and pills of seconal
and alphetanines were confiscated from a person whose visa was for the pur-
pose of the pilgrimage. For this reason the Agency is doubling its efforts
as a state of emergency begins with the arrival of thousands of visitors.

[Question] Uhat are the rehabilitation neasures, now that we have discussed
the preventive seasures?

[Answer] If an addict is affected as a result of giving up the habit. he is
sent to the hospital for treatment. And, if the hospital advises that this

77
person should be referred to some other specialized institution, we do that
even if his interrogation has not been concluded. The Agency plans to have
a hospital for the treatment of drug addiction attached to it. This, in ad-
dition to completing the complex which includes an institute for study and
research in the field of drugs, special training divisions, a lecture hall
for conferences, technical, computer and nicrofiln divisions, and social.
psychological and religious units and everything required for such a task.

AL-RIYAD also interviewed men of science in order to reveal a clear and
comprehensive picture of the adverse effects drugs have on the individual
and society. Dr 'Abdallah al-Bunyan, chairman of the sociology department of
the College of Arts at Riyadh University said:

No one denies the adverse effects of drugs on society.

Society develops and advances to the extent of the capabilities of its mem-
bers to create, excel and to work seriously and constructively. The bases

of a person's ability to excel and to work seriously and productively is

the clarity of his mind and his being in good health. The use of and ad-
diction to drugs, as proven scientifically, leads the individual to mental
stagnation and physical deterioration. As such, his ability to excel, create
and to work productively is impaired. Undoubtedly, this results in a major
loss to society, and will also cause the person bad relations and problems
with his fanily, the authorities, and society.

As for his relationship to his family, the use of drugs constitutes a finan-
cial drain which impairs the person's productive capabilities and consequent-
ly reduces his income. Finally, this may lead to the displacement of his
entire family due to his inability to support them. As for his relations
with the authorities, he exists in a state of fear and continual restless-
ness, and in the event of his arrest, his family will undoubtedly be dis-
placed. And, in his relation to society, he will become the object of

scorn and rejection which will affect him psychologically and in regard to
employment. In the final analysis he is finished as a person and a member
who was supposed to be beneficial to his family and society.

Concerning the effects of drugs on production, Dr Tal'at Inrahim Lutfi,
assistant professor of sociology said:

The problem of drug addiction is one of the deviant behaviors in society, and

like other social problems, is caused by many factors. One important factor
perhaps is the rapid spread of unbanization as the mode of life in modern

society and what usually accompanies it, such as a tendency towards indi-
viduslism, rapid educational change, excessive materialism and cultural
conflict, in addition to a continuous weakness in direct and meaningful re-
lationships. Also, the collapse of the non-governmental means of social
control.

78
in order to solve this problem, additional psychological and sociological
studies are needed to discover the causes of this deviant behavior, in addi-
tion to the necessity of cooperation between the concerned authorities and
scientists specialising in sociology, psychology, social work, mental health
and others.

Because of the adverse effects on public health caused by the use of drugs,
we met with Dr 'Adil 'Abd al-Hun'in, who said:

Alcohol, drugs and tranquillizera all operate through the nervous system
reducing restlessness and nerv0usness and leading to a feeling of vitality
and mental clarity, in addition to their influence on the psychological state.
Naturally their use say lead to addiction.

The cause of addiction is either psychological whereby the addict feels re-
laxed when he uses drugs despite his knowledge of their harmfulness, or it is
neurological-physiological whereby it affects the nervous system asking it
dependent on the drug in order to avoid certain physiological and psycholog-
ical repercussions in the event of withdrawal.

The ill effects of drugs are many, and they neatly affect the nervous system
and the psychological state. They include the symptoms of a chill, insomia,
restlessness, low blood pressure, and a constnat feeling of dizziness and
nausia. Nervous convulsions could occur, and at times the addict might go
through periods of memory lapses and hallucinations.

And, in the event that large quantities or doses are taken. this may place
treoendom pressure on the lungs and the heart, causing death.

Also, one of the lost dangerous complications is liver deterioration, which
causes death; and stomach and intentinal ulcers. It was found that the rate
of these complications occurring among alcoholics is much greater than among
non-addicts. Also, the affliction nay lead to liver and stonach cancer which
occur in a much higher percentage along drug and alcohol addicts.

Even smoking has grave harnful effects on the breathing systea, such as
causing a chronic asthns leading to an expansion of the air tunnels and lung
deterioration. It has been proven scientifically that lung cancer is very
frequent among smokers as compared to non-smokers.

UN-SPONSORBD DRUG ABUSE CONFERENCE REPORTED

Opening Meeting
Abidjan PRATBRNITE-MATIN in French 28 Nov 78 p 5
[Article by Diaby Salif]

[Text] Three years ago.a huge fire
ravaged the "Star of the South" bar

in Treichville, causing 20,000,000 in
damage. The disaster arose out of the
introduction into the "Star of the South"
of a barrel containing gasoline, put there
by drug dealers, stated Lucien Koula recent-
ly. Koula is the leader of the National
Narcotics Brigade; he was speaking before
the participants in the seminar on drugs
organized by the UNO in Abidjan.

Opened on 20 November at the Labor Exchange in Treichville by Ouassenan Kane,
Minister of Internal Security, the seminar will end on 1 December.

in his introduction, Lucien Koula noted that in the Ivory Coast it can be
stated without fear of error that the narcotics problem concerns cannabis and
the psychotropic substances that have been invading the clandestine market for

approximately five years.

Until now, fortunately, usage or illicit traffic in opiua or its derivatives
has not been confirmed. Of course, cannabis is cultivated in the Ivory Coast.
The police often discover and destroy plantings of "Cuedji", which is consuaed
in the Ivory Coast in the form of rough cigarettes.

The other forms, such as resin tablets and others, are not yet known in the
Ivory Coast.

Lucien Koula presented several striking cases of illicit traffic in cannabis
experienced by the judiciary police during the last few years.

80
In January 1977 an autonobile "drive shaft" containing 7,300 kg of cannabis
was seized; the automobile belonged to a Ghanaian dealer. Shortly afterwards
in Adahou, in the Tounodi subprofecture, 18 bags of cannabis weighing
927.600 kg were discovered and over 3,000 stalks of "the grass that kills"
were destroyed by the National Narcotics Brigade.

In N'Djeai, in the Jacquevllle subprefecture, the Judiciary Police Depart-
lent discovered a vast field of Indian heap which was being maintained by
non-nationals. Twelve thousand stalks of cannabis were destroyed.

About the fire at the "Star of the South", Lucien Koala said that "almost
three years before, a barrel had been divided into two equal parts by an in-
genious nethod of soldering.

The first half, the base, had been filled with cannabis, while the upper part
contained gasoline. Leaving Ghana, the traffickers were able in that way to
elude the vigilance of Customs and arrive in Abidjan.

The drum was delivered to a prostitute who was lodging at the "Star of the
South". And unfortunately the part containing the gasoline caught fire and
the "Star of the South" was ravaged.

So drug traffic has reached a significant volume in the Ivory Coast.
Lucien Koala presented statistics on the subject, revealing that in three
years (1975, 1976, and 1977), 272 transactions were handled by the police,
resulting in 522 persons, including 79 Iverians, being handed over to the
Abidjan prosecutor's office.

Obviously, Lucien Koula was speaking of the organization of the fight against
drug traffic in the Ivory Coast, an activity that is within the province of
the National Narcotics Brigade. a special section of the Judiciary Police
Department. The Brigade naintains close relations with the special services
of the United Nations and the OIPC [expansion unknownl-Interpol.

But Lucien Koula believes the fight against drug traffic must be the affair
of all the repression services, especially the gendarnerie and Customs.

"Well", he says, "with some exceptions all the soldiers in this struggle.
whether they are called policemen, gendarnes or customs officers, have very
little knowledge of the subject. In fact it is not unusual to hear policemen,
gender-es or customs officers refer to Indian hemp as opium. He must fill
this gap because of the magnitude of the phenomenon..."

Speaking of the legal aspects of the problem posed by drugs, Lucien Koula
pointed out that infractions of the applicable public health code are punish-
able by three months to five years in prison and a fine of 240,000 to
2,400,000 francs. or one of the two penalties only.

"We think, in the police force, that because of the ilportance attained by the
phenomenon in the Ivory Coast and also because of the harmful effects on man,

81
more severe sanctions should be envisioned. to strike at those who are in-
volved in the disorder and to dissuade those who are not yet involved".

Lucien Koula concluded by expressing the thanks of the UNO, which deploys

great effort to train the agents in charge of the fight against drug traffic
and abuse.

Discussion of Drug Situation
Abidjan FRATERNITB-MATIN in French 30 Nov 78 p 5

[Article by Laman Bakayoko: "(he Drug Addict: An Individual to be Taken
Care ofl"]

[Text] The organizing. under the aegis of the UNO and in our country, of a
training course in illicit narcotics traffic prevention cannot fail

to arouse real hope. It proves that at last there is very acute awareness of
the problem, and a determination to solve it in a radical way.

However. one fact surprises us, having to do with the Ivorian experience.
Referring to the various reportage: by our colleagues, it seems that much

more importance has been attributed to traffic in and consumption of Indian
help, which tends to minimize somewhat the consequences of the toxic products.
However, it behooves us to recognize that the amphetamines are high on the list
in the drug market in our country. Because, as a matter of fact. in addition
to "Guinean Corydrane" (which has the highest consumption--even by persons of
respectable age--among drug imports). the "Binoctal" and "Mandrax" tablets

are heavily absorbed by our drug addicts. That. moreover, is the kind of drug
that finds the most followers in a certain category of users.

On that subject, one is still astonished by how easy it is for these tablets
to get out--and also circulate--; for they are supposed to be delivered only
on strict medical prescription. In any case, one of the practical measures to
be taken in the fight against drug consumption consists precisely of strict
control of the issuing of toxic products.

And as for the measures, properly speaking we are adopting the thesis of
Dr Pierre Clever, who says:

"Repressive action must be directed solely toward the illicit and detestable
traffic in drugs and narcotics. Where the individual drug addict is concern-
ed, it is chiefly a question of helping him rehabilitate himself so that he
can give some meaning to his own existence."

In fact, the sole effect of Arts 626 and 627 of the Public Health Code could
not help but be an adequate "remedy", a fortiori a panacea, It is certainly
difficult to indicate here what trafficker in "Guinean corydrane", for exam-
ple. does not consume it himself. But it is obvious that in quite a few cases
the penalty of imprisonment becomes inopportune.

82
Let us take the case of an individual who is accustomed to "Binoctal". He
has ended up by convincing himself that without this tablet he cannot sloop.
Prison will not take that sad conviction away from a drug addict of that
category. At that stage the problem is one for the health p efessienal alone.

No one can fight without means. We think that new, with this course. .
our agents in all sectors will be able, with much more effectiveness than in
the past, to meet the drug traffic. Severe court sanctions will contribute
to more effectiveness in that area.

However, there is still the very delicate problem of those who are truly
suffering from the "rot". For the drug addict is a sick person, an individ~
ual who must be taken care of. And it is here that the means appear to us to
be limited. In fact, the "Blue Cross Center' in Nilliamsville--which has al-
ready proved its capability, but receives mostly alcoholics--is still the on-
ly one. For that reason, in anticipation of broad and clear success against
drug crimes. we must first increase the present center's capability to re-
ceive, and then we must create new ones.

Assuredly, the struggle against the drug phenomenon will be one of the boldest,
but the stakes--protecting society by rehabilitating and readapting the indi-
vidual drug addict--is worth the trouble.

UNO Narcotics Division Official
Abidjan FRATERNITE-MATIN in French 1 Dec p 9
[Article by Diaby Salif]

[Text] Mr Megali, Doctor of Law, is a member of the central training group
of the UNO Narcotics Division at Geneva. The participants in the seminar that
opened at the Labor Exchange in Treichville on 20 November followed with in-
terest his statements about illicit narcotics traffic, drug-detecting dogs
and international agreements.

About the agreements Mr Megali recalled last Wednesday at the Labor Exchange
that the first international meeting on drugs took place in 1909. After that
there were many agreements, protocols, commissions and control organizations.
In fact, one could no longer find one's way among them and in 1961 it was de-
cided that what was called a single agreement should be formed.

This agreement is single because it rests on one text, one control organiza-
tion. And as Mr Megali emphasizes, the innovation is that maintaining control
over crops is the chief objective of the agreement.

.‘The leader of the Abidjan seminar emphasizes that the single agreement does
not give legal definition to narcotics.

”If one wants to know whether something is a narcotic according to the single
agreement, he should refer to the appendix tables, of which there are four.

83
'ﬁhere is opium and there are opiates (opiates being products derived from

opium, morphine base, morphine, heroin and codeine). There is coca leaf and
cannabis.

"in addition to these natural products there are a number of synthetic pro-
ducts. Thus..methadone and pethidine correspond to opium. Among the syn-
thetic products tranquilizers, sedatives and barbiturates are distinguished."

The agreement on psychotropic substances is a recent one. it dates from 1971
and deals with hallucinogens, especially "LSD. which brings on a distortion of

the central nervous system in the sense that one who takes it sees music and
hears colors."

In the area of hallucinogens there are products which are unknown in Africa or
Europe. "There is the famous Mexican cactus. peyote". Mr Megali indicates.
"The Indians eat it and drink it."

There are also mushrooms, from which is derived a substance called mescaline.

Mr Megali indicates that "Generally, the single agreement. which includes both
natural and synthetic products, and the agreement on psychotropic substances.
when they are ratified bring with them obligations on the part of the states
that are to work out the laws and regulations and set up a special administra-
tion enabling their execution.

"Thus, when a country decides to grow opium, it is obliged to see to it that
the growing and the harvesting are done by a state-owned company. If it is a
privately-owned company it could have a special license.

"The growing of opium must be a state monopoly. That is the case with Turkey.
iran and lndia. Opium must be grown, because it yields basic products that
humanity needs, morphine, for example, which relieves pain."

Opium leads to heroin. New, to mention herein is to mention illicit traffic
and addiction. Then the laboratory of the UNO Narcotics Division in Geneva

looked for and found a variety of opium poppy that does not contain heroin.

it is another product. called thebaine.

And as Mr Megali puts it, "Another example is that it was believed that opium,
like cannabis. must have a natural enemy. They found this insect. But the

UNO does not want to give it to the countries that are requesting it, because
the insect is also known to eat cereals".

Opium growing, it is well known, represents the sole source of revenue for
the populations of certain a-eas of Asia. One of the concerns of the UNO is
to persuade those people to give up that ancestral activity in order to orient
themselves to substitute crops.

On this subject Mr Megali notes that the UNO program is especially interested
in Thailand, where five pilot villages have been created.

84
"Their inhabitants have agreed to give up opium and apply themselves to grow-
ing tobacco. potatoes and beans. The UNO's action should promote the creation
of other pilot villages."

Mr Negali says in conclusion that the countries participating in the Abidjan
seminar--Senegal, Niger, Togo, Benin and the Ivory Coast, have ratified the

agreements. But it is not enough to ratify them. They must be applied. A

special administration must be set up.

'"The UNO's goal is to train people so the participating countries may apply
the agreements", says Mr Hegali. “For international control is inconceivable
unless there is national control. One depends upon the other."

Severe Sanctions Favored
Abidjan PRATBRNXTE-MATIN in French 2-3 Dec 78 p 6
[Article by Diaby Salif]

[Text] The drug seminar organized in
Abidjan by the central training group
of the United Nations Narcotics Division
ended yesterday afternoon at the Labor
Exchange in Treichville, after ll days
of work. The closing session was pre-
sided over by Ouassenan Kane, minister
of Internal Security. At his side were
David Smith. resident representative of
the United Nations in Abidjan.

Koblan Huberson, general manager of
National Security, as well as members
of the executive committee of the UGﬂCI
[General Union of Ivory Coast workers].

After the summary report presented by Mr Megali, a member of the central train-
ing group of the UNO Narcotics Division at Geneva.."it is permissible to state
that the seminar has been a great success. especially considering the variety
and import ace of the subjects dealt with".

On that subject. it should be stated that the central training group, in order
to enliven the Abidjan seminar. called on a number of speakers representing
WHO, Interpol, the International Organization for Narcotics Control, customs
and the French police.

The summary report stated that "the discussions crystallized chiefly on the
question of whether the drug addict should be subject to the severity of the
law, or whether on the contrary he should be considered a sick person and
should even be given treatment.

The answer to that question was to depend upon an interministerial commission,
which would be formed and would outline a concerted policy to be sanctioned by

85
As far as the dealer is concerned, it was unanimously agreed that severe
sanctions nust.bo taken with respect to his. Indeed, it is inportant to
ferret him out everywhere and see to it that he feels safe nowhere.

The sin-nary report also stresses "that it was acknowledged that the internat-
ional fight. as well as control of the work on that level, could not succeed
without the existence on the national level of the indispensable cooperation
between all the interested services, as well as equally effective control.
Lacking that. the dealer will easily slip through the net".

In his speech-,- David Smith thanked the Ivory Coast govern-eat for its cooper-
ation in organizing the seminar. He also expressed his thanks to the gov-

ernments of Benin. Niger. Senegal and Togo for having cooperated with the
United Nations :by sending participants to the seainar.

David Smith then proceeded to present diplonas to the participants. Before
declaring the seminar closed. Ouassenan Kone took the floor to express his

gratitude. on behalf of the countries represented. to the [NO for the useﬁil
work which had just been accomplished.

Addressing the participants, he formulated the hope that the training lavish-
ed upon thel may result in a more effective fight against drugs. The nin-

ister of Internal Security urged all the services concemed to collaborate
closely for the lission's success.

A' cocktail party brought the participants together at 1800 at the "Power
Fighters" on the plateau.

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KAT HELD IN MADAGASCAR
Use Spreading in Madagascar
Tanansrive HADAGASCAR-HATIN in French 23 Nov 78 p 2

[Text] Doctor Braeden. director of the United Nations Drug Research Labora-
tory, will be here next Saturday to take part in a conference of experts on
hat being held in this capital under the aegis of the United Nations. free
27 Nave-bar to 1 December.

The purpose of this conference will be to compile and discuss the available
botanical. phat-ecological. and especially the chemical data on the composi-
tion of products extracted from the plant.

Experts from Great Britain. Egypt. Somalia, Saudi Arabia. Kenya. Norway.
Hungary, USA. and from the United Nations laboratory will take part in this
conference. whose solemn opening on anday 27 November at 1000 hours in the
conference hall of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Anosy will be presided
over by Mr Rshoto Ignace. minister of education and scientific research.

Kat has anoretic properties. which acutely deaden the sensations of hunger

and fatigue in its users. But when chewed. this plant. which is also a
stimulant of the central nervous system, produces a state of euphoria followed
by ecstasy. Kat also has aphrodisiac properties, which explains its abusive
use and its cumulative ill effects.

Kat was introduced into northwest Madagascar by the Somalis around 1946-47.
Its cultivation and use are now spreading westward (Albilobe, Ambanja. Nosy
Be) and eastward (particularly Vohemar). A small tentacle has already spread
to the capital and efforts to cultivate it have been observed in the area of
Toliary. It scientific name is Csths Bdulis. However. kat is truly rsvaging
East Africa now.

In France. it is classified under Table ”C" of poisonous substances. In
Yemen. its cultivation and use have been prohibited since 1972. when all
plantings throughout the country were destroyed.

it is merely a sensation. lie is unfit for work. which is harli'ul to the
economy and especially to the production effort.

Prior to Mr Cnarles's address. the director of the UN Drug Research Labora-

STATISTICS ON DRUG ADDICTS REPORTED
Athens Amorous in Greek 19 Nov 78 p 9
[Article by Din. Stavropouloa]

[Excerpts] ‘l‘he “saying“ which is frequently resorted to by the officers
of the Narcotics Prosecution Service of the Athens and Suburbs General
Security Subdirectorete when soneone 'challenges' than by saying to
than that narcotics have inundated the capital. is the following:

”sir. I will give you right now 100.000 dracheas. Within 3 hours.
can you bring as a grate of heshish?‘

The other person. of course. is taken aback. And then they say to him

'Do not believe the ruors. mo be sure. there are narcotics addicts
and peddlers of narcotics in Athens. but not so nany as the newspapers
write that there are. The authorities are in control. of the situation
at all tines...."

without a domat. this is correct. The police authorities have control
of the situation. and no one can fail to notice their repeated successes
in this sector in the breaking up of gangs. in the arrest of various
crininais of. this type. and so forth.

Much has been written about the novel-lent of narcotics in Greece. the
end result being the copious aguendering of the journalists' ink.

There have been exposes about clandestine neetings of yachts on the
high seas. about illegal rendezvous in isolated places. about nutual
extermination of were of various gangs. and nany other things.

And. as an epilogue to every article. we have epigranatically set down
the lollowing:

“Oi course all these things have happened in recent years. with the
increase in tourism."

89
But this is false. always. the authorities believed that they had
control of the situation. And the narcotics addiéts have always been
smoking their hashish under: their noses....Here are some examples:

In 1924, the notorious opium den 'Kaplana' was broken up. and the
police found within special hiding places 41? okel ll oke - 2.8 pounds]
of hashishl

In 1928. the I'renowned" opiun den "Drosia' of Nix. Khristotileas was
uncovered at Mbelokipoi.

In 1953. the numbers of a gang of narcotics sauggltrs were exposed

and arrested and 1.200 grams of hashish, 400 grams of. heroin. 300 grams
of. cocaine. and other narcotics worth at that time 4 million drachnas
were confiscated.

In 1954. a narcotics gang was exposed and broken up whose members had
established within a basket-making shop in the center of Athens a
complete factory for manufacturing heroin and hashish.

Narcotics Addicts on Increase

But these are only some examples. If we continue-sin the language of
figures-we will discover further that:

The nthens General Security arrested 72 persons in 1968 for the use or
selling of narcotics, 115 persons in 1969. and 199 persons in 1970.

in the Salonica region, the drug addicts nuabered 800 persons in 1968.
and according to the data from the Salonica General Security in the

two (allowing years they increased to 1.000. within the 4 years of
1967-1970. 17 persons died from narcotics and only 2 were cured. In all
probability. the true cause of deaths of narcotics addicts is concealed
for understandable reasons from the families of the victims. and they
are attributed to other causes.

The typical young narcotics addicts of this period were persons aged
19-24 years old.

But let us return to the “cold" figures:

Every year. «0 drug addicts are treated at the Athens Public Psychiatric
Hospital for detoxification. with an average length of treatment of
40 days. Another 60-65 are treated for a second or a third tile.

Origin of Narcotics in Greece

From 1965 to 1975. 400 patients were treated at the Detoxification
Clinic. while another 1,000 people passed through the outpatient
departments of this institution.

be entitled "Medical-Social Aspects of Drug Uae Among Youths in Schools and
in Hork Areas and its affects on the Armed Forces." He will be followed by
Professor Felice Caramia. director of the institute of General Pathology of
the University of Rene. He will discuss the pathology of drug addiction

and dryg dependency. Finally Captain Professor Massimiliano Stracca,
director of the Armed Forces Applied Psychology Task Porce, will explain

the psychodynsaic. social and cultural motivations linked to the use of
drugs and the preventive action and health education which has been conducted
for years in the Navy.

During the succeeding days. the meetings will be held in the auditorium of
the Navy's Training School for Arsenal Uorkers. Films on the damage caused

by use of drugs will be shown. Activities will be dedicated to young sea-
men. to student workers and to secondary school students. These will be
coordinated by Professor Caramia and by qualified physicians. The audience
will be able to participate in the discussion of the more interesting aspects
of this social evil.

The initiative is particularly important because it unites behind a single
objective all those who are following the development of the personality of
youth in the three most delicate phases of their upbringing, that is the
school. the draft and the work environment.

The social aspect of the educational function exercised by draft military
service also appears important. The La Spszia conference will be followed
by others held in all the Navy bases in cooperation with the Navy health
services. educational authorities and local public health authorities.

In this fashion a capillary campaign of dissemination and medication among
the youth, military personnel. students and workers will be developed. This
will contribute effectively to the preventive action which all social and
political forces are called upon to conduct in this delicate sector.

This program, which will commit the Navy health services in a pedagogical-
informstive action of high medical-social content, was fully supported by
Defense Minister Attilio Ruffini; Public Education Minister Mario Pedini;
and Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Giovanni Torrisi.

SARDINIA URPRBPARED TO COPE WITH DRUG PROBLEM
Milan IL GIORNALB NUOVO in Italian 4 Nov 78 p 18
[Article by Luigi Offeddu: "New Drug Traffic Also Passes Through Sardinia"]

[Text] ngliari. 3 Nov--0ne of the remaining unaffected areas on the
Italian drug distribution map has perhaps been definitively occupied: In
recent months many hits of evidence have confirmed that after having crossed
the Tyrrenian Sea, drugs are also arriving in Sardinia. This region
apparently has been immune from contagion until now.

Two or three years ago, soae sporadic arrests in Cagliari and Sassari had
aroused some concern. nut in the main, these involved so-called "light
drugs.” and tourists passing through the island ports. There was talk

about strange traffic in the more expensive places of the coast, but this was
linited entirely to a fashion item that certainly was foreign to the local
mentality. The investigators themselves were convinced that in a society
such as Sardinia--still tied to the land and to the rural world. traditionally
unresponsive to certain trends--drugs would be a phenomenon limited to a few
well defined circles.

All illusions crashed as a result of what happened over the past few months:
Thefts in drug stores. in the provincial capitals. but also (an even more
serious symptom) in many small centers around Sassari or Caglinri--multi-
plied until they became daily news items. Among the dozens of youths
arrested from January to the present throughout the island. there are no
tourists or seamen on shore leave: They are all Ssrdinians: students,
employees, skilled workers the unemployed.

Prospects for the future are anything but pleasant. There is an almost total
lack of rehabilitation centers and specialized personnel; the little that

is tried in the cities by volunteer doctors certainly is not sufficient to
cope with a future. foreseeable expansion of the phenomenon. Sardinia today
is entirely unprepared for such an eventuality. During medical conferences.
and in pages of local newspapers. the presence of Hell-organized distributors
around many schools in Caglisri. Sassari, Alghero and 01bia has often been
reported.
One of the “hottest“ areas is said to be be Maddalena. an American naval
base, which is reported to be an important center of distribution. Beyond
certain political speculations. this opinion seems to be confirmed by
numerous arrests this summer. not a few of which involved troops stationed
on the island.» The distribution of drugs in Sardinia is facilitated by
techniques already wellvtested on the mainland. Thus there is the wave of
"light drugs." easily available until the past spring. This was suddenly
interrupted at the beginning ofsummsrto pave the way for more profitable
and more dangerous substances.

Drugs are transported everywhere by ship. Most arrests take place during
the unloading of vessels. The main channels of importation pass through
the ports of 01bia, Cagliari and Porto Torres. During the peak traffic
period. especially in the summer. the large number of passengers and goods
makes it almost impossible for the police to carry out a careful check.
Often, action is decided upon by chance on the basis of lucky "leaks." but
most of the "goods" can move freely toward the cities of the interior. It
is precisely in the latter. more than elsewhere, that preventive and timely
action seems to be necessary. Areas like Berbsgia. which is rapidly being
transformed from herding to the assembly line, where the skilled worker is
still half shepherd, and where the traditional fugitive is being joined by
the political criminal. offer a very promising terrain for the more negative
aspects of our time.

The last alarm. in order of time, was sounded at Osilo, a small agricultural
village a few kilometers from Sassari. A few days ago. an argument among
some of the boys of the town caused by the sale of hashish. ended with gun—
play and one person dead. That cadaver struck the first blow at the idyllic
image-that of a certain Sardinia--which apparently no longer has a reason
for being.

ANTIDRUG AGREEMENT H11“ 0.8. ARNY--Hanau--cernan and Auerican police author-
ities have scored remarkable successes in conbatting drug traffic during

the past few weeks in the garrison towns of Hanau. Gelnhausen, and Buedingen.
A 0.8. Army spokes-an said in Hanau that since the beginning of the joint
action against drug dealers 17 dealers and 68 0.8. soldiers have been
arrested for selling or possessing drugs. Reportedly the soldiers are still
in confinement. The spokesman gave no details as to the quantities of the
drugs confiscated. The cooperation of the police authorities is based on

an agree-ent between 0.8. General Joseph J. Lesczcinsky and ﬂanau's police
director Herbert Callus. Thus, at variance with the provisions of the NATO
troops statute. ﬂanau police officers are allowed to pursue violators of

law also within the garrison area, for example. About 20,000 Auericans

are stationed in these three towns. According to police quarters the heroin
market in Hanan has been "largely swept clean" due to the innu-erable spe-
cial raids in which the law crininal investigation office also took part.
Meanwhile, drug investigators from Hanau have been working in neighboring
towns on seVersl occasions since the dealers are withdrawing to these towns.
