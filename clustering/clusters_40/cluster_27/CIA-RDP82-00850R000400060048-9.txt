[Article by Yu. V. Svitkin and V. I. Agol, presented by Academician A. s. Spirin
on 1 February 1981, Institute of Polio-yelitis and Viral Bncephalitides of the USSR

[Text] The RNA of the encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus with cell-free protein-
synthesizing systems, depending on the conditions is considered either completely,
or the translation is limited primarily by the S'-eno region of the viral genome
[1-5]. Limited translation is governed by the functioning of a relatively weak
"terminating signal" which is located in the viral RNA somewhere on the boundary

between the 5'-end region that codes the precursor of the structural protein (preA),
and the central region, in which the nonstructural polypeptide P is coded.

Under optimal conditions. termination does not occur at this site. however, the
rate of translation still is noticeably reduced [6]. Similar, although weaker,
"terminating" or"inhibiting" signals are apparently found on other sections of the
RNA of the EMC virus. Slowing down of translation on definite sections of the
matrices has been described in nonviral systems.

we recently advanced a hypothesis on the existence of a special factor of trans-
lation which promotes overcoming of similar weak "terminating signals." and called
it the elongation factor'x (EFJXY [6.5]. This report presents the first data which
confirm this hypothesis. Our experimental approach consisted of the following. we
initially obtained n system by artificial means in which translation on the boundary
hviwccn the RNA sections of the HMC virus which code the preA and P components

was drastically slowed down. He then attempted to overcome this translation

barrier by addition of different protein fractions isolated from the uninfected
cells.

dlyccrine to a final concentration of 102 was added to an extract made of Krebs-2
cells (fraction S30) [1.2] treated with micrococcal nuclease. Nine millimeters of
this extract were superposed on 5.5 m1 of [.25 M of sucrose prepared on buffer

solution A (65 mM KCl; 3.3 mM MgC12; 30 mM tris-HCI; pH 7.6; 0.1 mM EGTA; 2 mM
dithiotrelte. DTT) and centrifuged (12 h. 44,000 rpm, 2°C) in a Ti-SO rotor (Becknan).

The test tube contents were divided into 3 portions: upper 6 m1 (fraction S ).
lower 6 ml (”sucrose layer") and precipitate (ribosomes). whereas the proteigg
contained in the sucrose layer were precipitated out by ammonium sulfate. the pro-
tein precipitates were dissolved in buffer B (100 mM KCl; 20 mH trio—H61; pH 7.6;
0.1 mM EDTA; I an DTT: 52 glycerine). dialyzed against the same buffer and stored
at -70‘C. Protein concentration was defined according to [7].

The reconstructed cell-free system (25 ul) contained 12 ul (0.05-0.07 units of A26 )
of fraction 5 (preliminarily passed through a column with sephadex 6-25 balances
by buffer A wigg 3.3 mH DTT). 0.5 ul (0.4 units of A2 )of ribosomal suspension

in buffer A. 2 ug of RNA of ENC virus. 2.5 of sge stusged factor preparation. KCl
(firal concentration [30 mH). 83012 (3.3 mM). S-methionine (lo uCi. 2 u"). [9
unmarked amino acids. nucleotides and ATP-regenerating system [1.2]. Incubation
was done at 30°C under 50 ul of Bayol F. The reaction was stopped by adding

50 ul of dissociating mixture and the products were analyzed by electrophoresis

in a 15-1 polyacrylamide gel [1].

According to the previously obtained results [1.2]. when an unfractionated

extract (S30) is used as the cell-free system. complete translation of viral RNA
occurs (figure 1A. track a. see insert). This is indicated by the presence

among the products of translation. besides the preA polypeptide and products of its
splitting (A. 8. Di. 0. G. p lb. p 12) coded in the 5'-end section of the genome.
also of polypeptides F (central region). C. D. and E (3'-end region). In contrast
to this. the system which is reconstructed from the ribosomes and s 20. having

higr total protein-synthesizing activity. does not guarantee effective formation

of polypeptides coded in the central and 3'-end regions of the genome (figure in.
track c). Since in the high-molecular region of the gel. certain nonstructural
polypeptides are covered by incomplete chains of preA. it is convenient to judge
the presence of a barrier which prevents translation of the central region of the
genome from the presence or absence of polypeptide P. Incomplete translation in
the reconstructed system is apparently not associated with a deficiency of tRNA.
since addition of a surplus of tRNA practically does not affect the nature of the
forrmd products (figure 1A. track d).

The capacity of the reconstructed system to implement complete translation of

RNA of the EMC virus is restored as a result of addition of protein fractions
which are isolated from the ”sucrose layer" by precipitation with ammonium sul-
fate (fig in. tracks e-i). He assume that the fractions contain sr—x. For further
purification. material was taken which was precipitated from the "sucrose layer"
with saturation of (N8 )2306 between 50 and 702. since in this material. there

are relatively few baliast proteins. As is apparent on figure 18. the active

beginning (BF-X) is adsorbed on DEAR-sephatsel and can be eluted at 225 (but not
at 100) 1124 KCL.

The obtained result can be explained by the presence in the "sucrose layer" of a
factor which promotes the overcoming of weak terminating signals (i.e.. EF—X).
However. the possibility of another interpretation also existed. It could be
assumed that our reconstructed system is defective not for elongation. but proteo-
iytic activity required for the formation of viral proteins (including P) from the
corresponding precursors. From this viewpoint. the appearance of P in the
presence of active fractions of the "sucrose layer" would be explained by the
prﬁsenCc in them of the necessary proteases. In order to clarify the correctness
of this hypothesis. the reconstructed system was inCubated with viral RNA for 3 h.

Elongation was stopped by adding cylcoheximide. and incubation was continued for
another 15 h either in the presence or in the absence of Iaterial containing EF-X.
It was found that incubation of polypeptides synthesized in the reconstructed system
with EP-X preparation did not result in the appearance of polypeptide F (fig 1C).
Thus, the hypothesis on protease nature of the factor we studied was not confirmed.

We note that during lengthy incubation (18 h). a certain quantity of polypeptide
F is formed in the reconstructed systea even without the addition of material from
the sucrose layer. This agrees with the already mentioned concept that the block
preventing synthesis of polypeptide P can be manifest not in complete stopping.
but only in a considerable delay in translation. It still remains unclear

whether this slow overcoming of the translation block is associated with residual
quantities of EF-X. probably present in the reconstructed system. or with the fact

that slow movement of the ribosomes in the corresponding region is also possible
with complete absence of EF-X.
An important question is whether EF-X corresponds to the known components of the
protein-synthesizing apparatus. The answer to this question requires further
studies. in particular. purification of EF-X. However. even now one can note that
EF—X is apparently not the RNA-bonding protein. since it is not adsorbed on the poly-
(V)-cellulose (fig 11'). In this respect. it is distinguished from the previously
described eukaryote factors of elongation (EF-l and EF-Z) and the majority of
factors of initiation of eukaryote translation [8.9].

[Text] The development of a chronic viral infection, according to one of the

theories. may be associated with integration of genomes of the virus and the

chronically infected cell [1]. Experiments on transfection of sensitive cells with
DNA preparations made of chronically infected cells in a number of cases confirm

the possibility of including the DNA—copy of the genome from an RNA-containing

infectious nononcogenic virus in the cellular genome [2). The presence of a limited
number of virus-specific sequences in nuclear DNA of chronically infected cells [3]

has been shown by the method of molecular hybridization.

In order to study precisely the integration variant of viral persistence develop-
ment. we used combined infection of cells with Russian tick-borne encephalitis virus
(TEV) and GVAO. In combined infection. it is hypothetically possible to conjugate
the processes of reproduction of the genomes from both viruses, and to incorporate
the TEV genome into the cellular DNA similarily to incorporation of the 0V60 genome
into the DNA of the transformed cells [5]. Direct detection of virus-specific
sequences in the cellular DNA is possible by the method especially designed to
establish localization of individual genes in the DNA fragments which develop under
the influence of different restrictases [h]. This method was successfully used to
study the nature of OVAO genome incorporation into the DNA of the transformed

cells [5].

Ll'lo cells were infected with TEV. strain "MW" which was isolated from chronically
infected cells grown for several years [ll]. The original TEV strain “Sof’in”
during infection of the cells jointly with OVAO did not induce the appearance
of transfixing activity of the DNA preparations made of infected cells. After

incubation of the culture cells with TEV, reinfection with OVAO was done. The
cells were then repassivated several times. DNA was isolated from the nuclei of

the infected cells by the method of phenol deproteinization with preliminary
treatment with pronase and subsequent treatment with RNA-ase [6]. The obtained
DNA preparations were used for transfection and for work with the restrictases.
In the experiments to transfect kidney cells of p19 embryos with SPEV, DNA pre-
parations were used for the infection (20-40 ug/lo5 cells). The control was DNA

preparations treated with DNA-ase and RNA—sac (50 ug/ml).

RNA of TEV was isolated from a purified virus by the standard method of phenol
deproteinization. The genome RNA of TEV is typical messenger RNA with molecular
weight on the order of 3.0 HD (60 S).

Restrictases were isolated by the method of Green [7] and Bickle [8]. DNA pre-
parations from infected. uninfected cells and thymus of a calf were exposed to
splitting by restrictases. DNA from uninfected cells L 2 0 and the DNA of calf
thymus were used as the control. The latter was selecfed as the control because
during synthesis of 32P-kDNA by TEV RNA. the seed crystal was thymus DNA that was
fragmented into short chains under the influence of DNA-ase I. The material was
further applied to lamellar gel of 12 agarose. Fragments of DNA of the l-phage
formed under the influence of restrictase were used during fractionating of the
material by electrophoresis as the markers to determine the dimensions of the DNA
fragments.

DNA fragments from the agarose gel were transferred to nitrocellulose filters by
the method of Southern [4]. After drying. the filters were incubated for 24 h

at 65°C in Denhardt's solution [9]. After addition of labelled preparations. kDNA
hybridization was done in the same solution at 65°C for 68 h.

The dried filters were exposed after hybridization and washed of the free labelled
material with RT-l films at room temperature for 3-12 days.

32P-kDNA was synthesized with the help of revertase using scattered or statistical
inoculation. short DNA fragments formed under the influence of DNA-ase I on DNA of
calf thymus. The reaction was done according to the method of Taylor [10] with
concentration of the seed crystal 0.25 us/ml.

After a preliminary series of experiments to select suitable restrictases, the
virus-specific sequences were detected in the DNA fragments of the cells infected
with TEV and OVAO. Figure 1 (see insert between pp 916-917) presents the results
of radio autographic finding of virus-specific sequences in the restriction frag-
ments of nuclear DNA. The following are clearly revealed: DNA fragment after
resctriction of Eco RI with molecular weight of 6.0 ND. DNA fragment after res-
triction ongl II with molecular weight of 11.0 HD. and DNA fragment after res-
triction of Pat I. In the case of DNA treated with Hind III. no obvious bands of
hybridized material were noted. The latter can be governed by the fact that small
DNA fragments developed. while the rate and level of hybridization were propor—
tiunal to the molecular weight of the interacting fragments. With equal experimen-
tal conditions. part of the DNA fragments with high molecular weight first becomes
a hybrid. 1n the control DNA of the LlZlO cells and the DNA of the calf thymus,

l
no hybridization band was observed.

The sizes of the restricticn fragments of DNA that hybridize with RDNA by TBV RNA.
according to the molecular weight of one chain coincide with the dimensions of the
genome RNA of TEV in the case of Eco R1. or exceed the dimensions of RNA in the
case of fragments which develop under the influence of Bgl II and Pat I restrictases
The latter can be governed by the presence in the fragments of DNA sequences that
adjoin the continuous sequence of the DNA-copy of the viral genome from two sides.
This may be entirely associated with the fact that under the influence of various
restrictases. one DNA fragment develops which bears the virus—specific sequences.

The findings first of all confirm the possibility of incorporating the DNA-copy

of the TEV genome as a single block. For more complete discussion of the results
it is expedient to present data on the transfixing activity of cellular DNA [ll],
reducing them to Table 1 which is convenient for examination. The data presented
in the table indicate the absence of infectious properties of the DNA from the
cells infected with TEV only. The infectious properties of cellular DNA appear
after combined infection with TEV and 0V40 (TCDso/ml-6.0). Infection of the cells
with TEV jointly with the virus of the Rous sarcoma (RSV) results in the emergence
of infectious properties of DNA (TCD 0[ml-3.5). The greatest infectiousness

is noted in DNA from cells jointly in ected with TEV + OVAD + RSV (TCD o[ml-6.25).
It is noted that DNA infectiousness is completely removed by the effecg of DNA-ase.
but not RNA-ase. Data on titration of full-value infectious virus T! which
develops after transfixing of sensitive cells with DNA preparations made of
chronically infected cells not only confirm the incorporation of the full DNA-
copy of the TEV genome into cellular DNA. but . mainly, indicate the complete
expression of the DNA-provirus.

The presence of onco-RNA-viruses in the TEV-infected cells plays a significant
role in the formation of the DNA copy of the TEV genome, the DNA from cells which
areJOintlyinfected with TEV and RSV during transfection induce the appearance of
an infection virus. The absence of infectiousness of the cellular DNA infected
only with TEV forces us to assume a stimulating effect of OVLO on the activity

of the onco-RNA-virus usually present in the cells. Stimulation of activity of
onco-RNA-viruses on the part of OVAD is quite probable. The 0V40 stimulates the
output of adenovirus with the combined infection of cells [12].and 0V60 in its
action in this respect is analogous to the effect of iododesoxyuridine [13]. In
terms of the studied Question on incorporation of the TEV genome, all that has been
listed in relation to OVéO is additionally strengthened by the known data on
stimulation of cellular DNA synthesis during infection with OVAO [lb].

Based on the available data. one can hypothesize a possible path for formation

of a DNA—copy of the genome of an RNA-containing nononcogenic virus and its
inrorporntion into chromosomal DNA of cells jointly infected with TEV and OVAO.

The initial stage. synthesis of the DNA-copy can be associated with manifestation

of the activity of onco-RNA-viruses usually present in the cells. Their inverse
transcriptase does not have specificity in relation to the matrix. The subsequent
stage, incorporation of the DNA-copy can be associated with the possible conjugation
of the processes of preproduction of the TEV genome and the processes of repro-
duction of viruses which reproduce in parallel and are capable of incorporation.

INTERFERONS IN MEDICAL THEORY AND PRACTICE

Moscow INTERFERONY V TEORII I PRAKTIKE HEDITSINY in Russian 1981
(signed to press 12 Mar 81) pp 2-6. 398-600

and Practice” by Valentin Dmitriyevich Solov‘yev and ragir Abdullayevich
Bektemirov. USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. Izdatel'stvo 'Heditsina'. 2021
copies. «00 pages]

[lext] Eleven years have elapsed since the publication of the first edition of
this book. During this interval of time a very great amount of data. both
experimental and clinical. has been amassed: these data dictated the need for the
present edition. The monograph has been almost completely rewritten. It gives a
description of viral interference. considering in detail interference not caused
by interferons.

The book examines the properties of interferon. the interferonogenic activity of
different families and groups of viruses and their sensitivity to interferons.
Considerable space is given to data on interferon production by leucocytes and
macrophages. as well as to methods of obtaining and purifying leucocyte.
lymphoblastoid and fibroblast interferon. The role of interferons in the
pathogenesis of viral infections and their significance as an index of reactivity
under normal conditions and in pathology are presented in detail. The book
correlates materials on experimental and clinical application of exogenic
interferon and stimulators of endogenic interferon of viral and nonviral nature.
Great attention is given to nonantigenic inducers of interferon. Data are
presented on the non-antiviral action of interferons and their inducers. including
the effect on antibody production and cellular immunity. A special chapter is
devoted to oncogenic viruses and interferon. In it the mechanisms of the
formation and action of interferons are described. In conclusion. an evaluation
is given of the theoretical significance of interferons and the prospects of their
use in practice.

The monograph is intended for virologists. innunologists. biologists and
physicians.

The book contains 33 tables and 37 figures; the bibliography. 585 titles.

I NT RODUCT ION

The first edition of our book. I'Interferon in Medical Theory and Practice" was
published in 1970. In that edition the existing studies in the literature were
correlated; the results of our own research were presented. and the outlook for
further research was given. The book received a high appraisal from readers and
was awarded the D. I. Ivanovskiy Prize. In 1973 the book was translated into
Czech and published in Prague by the Avicenum Publishing House. In the same year
a somewhat supplemented edition was translated into mglish and published by
Plenum Press in New York.

Since then many experimental findings and results of clinical observations have
been amassed. This fact accounts for the need for the present edition. Into it
went completely revised materials and the results of studies by Soviet and foreign
scientists up to 1980. He are unable to give a complete bibliography of studies
on interferons since it would exceed the scope of the present monograph.
Accordingly the bibliography gives only studies published since 1970.

The range of research has also expanded incomensurately with the past. Evidence
of the existence of several types of interferons and their action has been
obtained not only in viral infections but also in normal cells and cells
undergoing malignant changes. It has also been demonstrated that interferon
obtained from human blood leucocytes is capable of being highly concentrated and
purified of inactive proteins. Such a concentrated preparation. containing up to
1 million or more activity units per 1 ml of volume. may be. and is being.
employed in diverse pathological conditions. not solely those of viral etiology.

The newest trend is the use of interferons in clinical oncology. It is more
advisable to use concentrated preparations for therapeutic use in this pathology.

The difficulties associated with obtaining human donor blood. which serves as a
source for obtaining leucocyte interferon. necessitated a search for other
producers. Following up the species specificity of interferon. we unexpectedly
discovered that swine leucocytes are capable of producing interferon which acts on
human diploid cells in the same way as human interferon.

In the USA. England and other countries research is being conducted in the
direction of obtaining interferon-forming cells outside the organism. Here two
methods have been established: one consists of using cultured lymphcblastoid
cells; the other. of using diploid producer cells. Both these methods are also
being used in our country's laboratories. Up to now. however. they have been at
the stage of experimental study and have not entered medical practice.

Ten years ago we formulated the so-called interferon reaction of leucocytes. It
consists of the fact that the general ismunoreactivity of an organism can be
evaluated according to the activeness of interferon produci ion by lymphoid tissue.
After numerous tests we recomended this reaction for evaluiting the condition of
the reticuloendothelial system under normal conditions and in pathology.

Interferons are now viewed as an indispensible component of immunological
reactivity which to a significant extent ensures the stability of the organism's
internal environment. The significance of interferons as factors of antiviral
immunity is being increasingly evident. It is most likely that interferons are
the regulators of many immunity reactions. They are known to influence cell
division. the activity of normal killer cells. DNA synthesis in lymphocytes. the
delayed type of hypersensitivity reaction and transplantaton immunity.

Recent years have been marked by numerous studies in immunobiological and
cytogcnetic directions. which have revealed new facts characterizing the
mechanisms of the formation and action of interferons.

In conclusion. a word must be said about the stages of development of the study of
interferons. For many years the scientists of the USA and England did not
consider studies on exogenic interferon of current interest and sought substances
and means inducing the formation of endogenic interferon. working on different
synthetic preparations of the type of polynucleotides. But beginning in 1976.
foreign scientists' interest in exogenic interferon-i.e.. in the direction which
Soviet investigators had been developing since 196u-—sharply increased.

At the recent Fourth International Virology Congress the reports of foreign
scientists were devoted to presentation of experimental and clinical experiments
on successful use of exogenic interferon obtained from leucocytes of donor blood.

The monograph offered to the reader retains the previous title in only slightly
changed form. The title successfully reflects the contents. which have been
almost completely rewritten.

The authors sought not only to present the current data as accurately as possible
but also. principally to reflect the results of studies by Soviet scientists
engaged in the study of interferons. Realizing the complexity of the task in
hand, we will gratefully accept critical remarks and suggestions.

HOW WE SEE WHAT HE SEE

Moscow KAK HY VIDIH TO, CHTO VIDIM in Russian 1979 (signed to press 29 Mar 79)
pp 2-5, 207

(Annotation, foreword by Academician 0. G. Gazenko and table of contents from book
"How We See What We See", by Vyscheslav Yevgcn'yevich Demidov, "Science and
Progress" series, Izdatel'stvo "Znaniye", 100,000 copies, 208 pages]

[Text] The problem of perception of the outside world with the organ of sight is
one of the interesting natural scientific problems. We find the names of many out-
standing people of different times and nations among those who nade their contribu-
tion to it. At present, major scientific teams, armed with the most modern
investigative methods, are working on this problem. Among them is the Laboratory
of Physiology of Sight, Institute of Physiology imeni I. P. Pavlov, USSR Academy

of Sciences, in Koltushi near Leningrad, which used the principles of holography

to explain the "mechanism" of processing visual information of our brain. In
discussing the work at this laboratory, the author makes broad use of material
obtained by other Soviet and foreign researchers. This scientific and literary
book is intended for a broad circle of readers.

Foreword

The author of this book is not only a reporter, but an engineer. The book itself
is theresultof 5 years of fruitful collaboration with scientists from the Labora-
tory of Physiology of Sight, Institute of Physiology imeni I. P. Pavlov, USSR
Academy of Sciences. For these entire 5 years, the author attentively watched

the progress of its staff and constantly published articles about their work.

The problems discussed in this book are presented by V. Demidov on the basis of the
holographic hypothesis of brain function, which is being actively developed in recent
times by scientists of the entire world (in all fairness, let us mention that this
conception is not shared by all researchers). Among these studies, the work of
Soviet scientists occupies a prominent place, particularly those working at the
Institute of Physiology imeni I. P. Pavlov. And, since holography is the child

of engineers, it becomes understandable why one of them was able to make sense,
easily and without constraint, out of the sea of diverse information that appears
scattered outwardly but actually demonstrates a profound unity of material

essences of the world revealed to us, using a holographic compass.

The solitary approach the author used to the most varied problems brought him
deserved success. Demidov finds good explanations for "mysterious" phenomena

16

FOR OFFKJA1.USE‘0NLN
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

and advances plausible hypotheses by examining from the same positions the ques-
tion of identifying visual images and causes of the "whims” of fashion, perception
of color and structure of different systems of the optical tract, visual illusions
and formation of the internal model of the world. Such discoveries include, for
example, the hypothesis of reasons for changes in fashions, the explanation of

the "secret” of Penrose's triangle and "impossible pictures"; the author uses a
unique and curious approach to the problem of essence of abstractions and concept
of beauty. There is convincing disclosure of a seemingly paradoxical thesis that
visual illusions are a reflection of the automatic accuracy of function of the
visual system, a reflection of accuracy of the model of the world formed as a
result of man's prior experience.

The lucidity, understandability and, at the same time, scientific strictness of
presentation of material are definite qualities of the book that you have in your
hands. The bibliography used by the author is referable to the works of the
greatest scientists dealing with problems of vision, both Soviet and foreign.
Demidov knows many of his heroes personally; he has visited scientific laboratories,
witnessed experiments and, for this reason, he has conveyed the atmosphere of
scientific search in an entertaining and convincing manner.

A good, graphic language is used to present extremely complex problems of neurophysio-
logy and psychology, cybernetics and medicine; the author never falls into vulgari-
zation. He operates freely with the concepts of many sciences, cites good and

vivid examples, so that it will be unquestionably interesting to the reader to

follow the logic of development of the subject. The problem of holography is a
mathematical problem in many respects, and it is all the more pleasing that he
succeeded in explaining it without formulas, on a level that is quite understandable
to the broadest reader. It is very important that Demidov refers to the most recent
works, the results of which were literally just published, in 1977, and one feels

the pulse of modern times in the book, it is timely and fresh.

The history of learning about the mechanisms of function of the visual system is
the history of the struggle of science against idealism. The results of current
research confirm, again and again, the materialistic thesis that it is possible to
gain knowledge about nature in all of its manifestations, including such extremely
complex ones as sight and thinking. Science puts electrochemical processes in
neuronal networks of the brain, which are amazing in their refinement, in the place
of the "soul." Witheachyear, experimental techniques grow more and more sophisti-
cated, and we are delving deeper and deeper into the essence of things. Man is
learning more and more about himself and penetrates into mysteries that make

those of the oceans and space paler. At the same time, the language of science is
growing increasingly complex; science is breaking down into more and more narrow
disciplines, so that scientists working in one laboratory have difficulty in
discerning problems of their neighbors in the next laboratory. The volume of in-
formation is growing like a snowball, and for this reason the role of scientific
popularization, particularly when it generalizes the achievementsin related and
allied disciplines, is ever growing in our times. Not infrequently, a scientist
will glean some useful information from such works. Demidov's book is one of them-
a successful attempt at summarizing results obtained by specialists working in the
most varied areas of knowledge. He not only was able to summarize, but relate
these results to vital problems that are close to literally everyone, blending the
seriousness of the scientist's approach to the vitality of a writer's style.

[Text] There is discussion of methods of choice of experimental material in the
structure of an algebraic model and determination of the coefficients of the model
for describing various static functional modes of biological systems. The use of
functions and regression equations is demonstrated for synthesis of mathematical
models of biological systems.

Methods are described for primary processing of experimental data, for equalizing
statistical series, determining the reliability of differences, determination of
laws of distribution in correlation and spectral analysis of random biological
processes and use of Markovian random processes.

This book is a textbook for courses on "Biological Cybernetics," "Bionics,"

"Medical Cybernetics," "Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems" and “Biophysics"
for students at universities, medical and pedagogic institutes and institutes of
physical culture; it may be useful to scientists concerned with problems of mathe-
matical biology. Figures 76, tables 37, references 69.

Introduction [to Part I] '

Methods of modern algebra are used extensively in various branches of science-
mathematics, mechanics, physics, cybernetics and mathematical biology. They include
linear algebra, logical algebra, matrix albegra, set algebra and algorithm algebra.

In constructing biosystem theory and solving various problems, modern biology and
medicine make extensive use of methods of quantitative analysis of the link between

17

FOR OFFKJA1.USE(HNLY

output coordinates and input factors. Use is made of the conception of a link in the
form of tables and graphs, from which one turns to mathematical descriptions. The
simplest mathematical description of the link between output coordinates of biologi-
cal systems and input factors can be obtained by means of various algebraic functions.
In this case, the mathematical description is a functional model of the biosystem.

The diversity of interactions between biological systems and the environment makes it
necessary to use both elementary functions and superpositions thereof varying in
complexity in order to describe them. There is discussion here of algebra methods
that permit solving problems of synthesis of various functional models of biological
systems; however, listing all of the methods of functional relations and equations
used in modern mathematics is not an end in itself. Attention is devoted chiefly

to the methods and specific types of functions that have now become quite popular
in mathematical biology.

This book, which deals with applied algebra as a science but theory of biology,
is concerned with methods of searching for types of functions according to experi-

mental data, investigation of applicability of algebraic models to solving biological
and medical problems.

[Text] Methods are described of theory of differential equations, which permit
synthesis of mathematical models of the dynamics of biological systems. There is
discussion of linear equations with constant and variable coefficients, typical
nonlinear equations, first and second order partial [differential2] equations. Much
attention is given to proper investigation of equations for phase and structure
profiles. Methods are described for writing differential equations for biological
systems with gradual complication of physiological conditions, which permit

Introduction

In mathematical biology, wide use is made of methods of differential equation theory
for the synthesis of mathematical models of dynamic modes of biological systems.

Thus, to describe the function of biological systems, use is made of theory of
linear differential equations; first or second order differential equations are used
to describe the function of biological systems with reference to one parameter; sys-
tems of linear differential equations are used to synthesize mathematical models
describing the dynamics of many parameters; the entire spectrum of formal mathema-
tical methods for solving differential equations, including methods of computation
["computing mathematics"?], is used for concrete modeling.

It is known that the dynamic behavior of biological systems is quite complex and

so multifaceted that mathematical models based on linear differential equations can
only be considered modeling in the first approximation.

In this textbook, the biological examples are included virtually everywhere in the
descriptions of methods of writing and solving the appropriate differential equa-

tions; they are often an adequate description of the dynamics of variables and
conform with the objectives and tasks of modeling.

The distinction of the presentation also lies in the fact that the sections of
differential equation theory that are the easiest to comprehend and most used to
solve biological and medical problems are very concise. The more difficult sec-

tions dealing with nonlinear equations, equations with variable coefficients are
more comprehensive.

Unity of structure and function is inherent in the function of 'liological systems.
Whenever this must be reflected in mathematical models, it is often (and will be
more and more often in the future) necessary to use methods of describing the form
of different structures (organ, vessels) and distribute among structures the
variables (concentration, potential, pressure) that determine functional states.
For this reason, we devoted much attention to description of theory of partial
equations with the use of examples.

It is known that partial differential equations have found wide applications in
physics as an effective tool that permits describing different physical phenomena
which include, in particular, heat conduction diffusion, electric and magnetic
fields, propagation of diverse waves and quantum fields. The intensive development
of mathematical biology in the last decades has led to expansion of the area of
application of partial differential equations of the second order. We can arbi-
trarily single out two main directions. The first is related to development of
mathematical theory of biological phenomena, which are based on physical processes
(diffusion, head conduction, etc.), described by second order partial equations.
Use of partial second order equations to describe the propagation of pulse waves
in blood vessels, diffusion of oxygen and other substances in cells, in the micro-
circulatory system and other phenomena are illustrations of this direction.

The second direction of using second order partial equations is related to quantita-
tive description of biological processes which are in essence biological, even
though they present some analogy to certain physical processes. This direction can
be illustrated with examples of theory of inflammatory processes.

Discussion of biological applications of second order partial equations is
limited to a small section, which briefly describes the classification of second
order partial equations and the most frequently encountered boundary value problems.

The methods of solving partial equations are described in the sections dealing with
specific biological problems. Of course, the material presented in the foregoing
does not cover all of the branches of mathematical biology making use of second
order partial equations developed to date. The examples are given here in such

a manner as to illustrate as broadly as possible the different methods of solving
problems in the field of biology to which these problems refer.

In the presentation of specific sections, considerable attention is devoted to
biological validation of the mathematical system used.

[Text] This book analyzes the mechanism of action of agents that modify radiation
lesions on the molecular level. Much attention is devoted to molecular interactions
between radioprotective agents, radiosenaitizers and biologically important endo-
genous macromolecules. An original conception is developed of a complex biochemical
mechanism of action of agents that modify radiation lesions; special attention is
given to processes of temporary inhibition of replicative processes and stimulation
of DNA repair processes. Analysis is made of data on the significance of temporary
formation of mixed disulfide bonds between radioprotective agents--amino thiols-
and protein-enzymes having a sulfhydryl group. The existing hypotheses concerning
the mechanism of action of radioprotective agents are discussed critically. This
book is intended for radiobiologiats, biochemists, physicians, senior year students
at biological VUZ's and medical institutes. Tables 1, figures 14; references 570.

Foreword

The problem of change in radiosensitivity of the organism by means of various chemi-
cal compounds-—modifiers--is still one of the most pressing ones that are being
worked on intensively in modern radiobiology.

In the Soviet Union, much attention is given to development of this direction. The
first monograph analyzing the state of the question of chemical protection of or-
ganisms against ionizing radiation was published by Ye. F. Romantsev and A. V.
Savich in 1958. Since that time, many books have been published shedding light

on different aspects of modification of radiation damage by means of chemical
compounds (Yu. 3. Kudryashov, P. G. Zherebchenko, A. G. Sverdlov, N. N. Suvorov.

V. S. Shashkov, S. P. Yarmonenko, L. Kh. Eydus, A. S. Hozzhukhin, F. Yu. Rachinskiy
and others).

However, radiobiology is developing so rapidly, that there is an urgent need to
periodically report the achievements in this branch of natural science in the
form of summarizing works. This book describes the concept of complex biochemical
mechanism of radiation lesion modifiers, which is developed by the authors, and
analyzes the status of the problem as a whole.

It is of basic importance to comprehension of the triggering effects of radiation
to conduct studies of the molecular mechanisms of action of radiation modifiers.
At the same time, identification of the molecular mechanisms of the effects of
radiation on cells opens up the prospect of new approaches to the search for
effective radioprotective and radiosensitizing agents. For this reason, we
deemed it expedient to shed light on a number of basic sections of radiation bio-
chemistry, with emphasis on biochemical mechanisms of interphase death of irradi-
ated cells. Modifiers intervene actively in virtually all biochemical processes
that determine individual and species-specific radiosensitivity. For this reason,
analysis is made in relevant chapters of data on the effects of radioprotective
and radiosensitizing agents on DNA metabolism, RNA biosynthesis, processes of DNA
replication and repair, protein synthesis in animals and energetic processes in
the cell. It was judged necessary to discuss briefly the state of the question

of possible role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and prostaglandins in the
mechanism of radioprotective agents. Much attention is devoted to analysis of mole-
cular mechanisms of manifestation of activity of radiation damage modifiers,
questions of temporary inhibition of replicative processes and optimization of
conditions for DNA repair. At the end of the book, there is discussion of some
general patterns in the molecular mechanism of radiation damage modifiers, and a
scheme is offered for different stages of their biological activity.

It so happened, historically, that radioprotective agents were studied as compounds
intended to protect eukaryotes against absolute minimal lethal doses of ionizing
radiation ("hemopoietic form" of radiation sickness). At the same time. it is
already apparent that it is possible, in principle, to provide protection against
considerably larger doses of penetrating radiation. This increases interest in
the problem of modifying radiation effects with chemical compounds.

Modern molecular radiobiology and radiation biochemistry are developing quite
rapidly. For this reason, we are aware of the fact that, by the time this book
is published, new data will appear concerning the mechanism of radiation damage
modifiers.

The authors will be grateful to all readers for any critical comments they may have.

He will examine some psychophysiolngical characteristics of the operator which should
be considered in formulating the information similarity criteria. of these charac-
teristics, the most important are the transmission functions and transmission
information capacity on visual, acceleration and auditory channels.

The operator's transmission functions are determined by his psychophysiological
features and properties of the control loop in which the operator is working. If
the operator controls a stationary loop of control, for example. FV [flight vehicle],
then his transmission function in the perception of visual information and trans-
mission of signals to the control units will look like

the transmission function coefficients (1.19) are presented in table I.

It is apparent that for different frequencies of the perceived signal. the para-
meters of the transmission function adopt different values. This indicates the

The vestibular analyzer contains otoliths and semicircular canals.

The otolithic apparatus includes the utriculus and sacculus. The structure of these
organs is characterized by a fixed part. the macula. and movable parts. like

pendulums. the otoliths. Movement of the heavy otolith above the macula causes a
sensation of inclination or movement. It is believed that the utriculus reacts to
linear accelerations. while the sacculus perceives vibrations.

Linear accelerations generated by the gravity force or active forces are the
input quantity of the otolithic appparatus. In this case, the following con-
clusion is correct: the utriculus perceives forces of any direction (vector

quantities) and is stimulated by shearing forces in thc plane of the otolith. The
quantity of information obtained by men through the otoliths is determined by
their dynamic characteristics.

Studies have shown that a redamping pendulum which reacts to linear accelerations
of any direction is a mathematical model of the otoliths. The otoliths. like any
pendulum. do not distinguish accelerations of active forces and the gravity force.

Man can therefore correctly determine the position of the local vertical only with
0 fixed position or with rectilinear uniform movement.

The otolithic transmission function can be presented in the form

The amplitude-frequency and phase-frequency characteristics of the otolith are

pending on the frequency of the perceived acceleration: at low frequencies,

quency, and partially medium frequency accelerations play the main role in the
human spatial orientation. In addition, because of the property of the body's

adaptation to constant and low—frequency accelerations. information about these
accelerations is not used to determine the spatial position.

During the perception of angular velocities. the human operator also has threshold
values which. with a delay of 0.1 s are: 3.2 deals for heeling; 2.6 deg/s for
pitching. and 1.1 deals for yawing.

The vestibular system and vision are linked so that the image on the retina is
stabilized during rotation of the head. Discrepancy between movement of the eyes

and sensations of the vestibular system does not exceed 0.1 s. Negative illusions
develop with greater discrepancy.

The examined transmission functions are mathematical models of pilot activity in
the control loop of a FV or simulator. Acquisition of habits and the knowledge
necessary for correct functioning is attained in the training process, including
on the simulator. During training on the simulator, the pilot acquires knowledge
that increases as the training time increases. Experimental studies show [10] that
increase in knowledge during the training process occurs by the exponential law.

longer than the process of control. therefore the coefficient a in formula (1.19)

REDUCTION IN ADAPTATION TIME IN ERGATIC CONTROL SYSTEMS
Kiev AVTOHATIKA in Russian No 5. Sep-Oct 79 (manuscript received 19 Feb 79) pp 59-62

[Article by V. V. Pavlov and A. M. Heleshev, Institute of Cybernetics. UkSSR Aca-
demy of Sciences]

[Text] The PoﬂﬁibilitYof rapid compensation for the consequences of failures in
the control system plays an exceptionally important role in ergatic systems in
which the human operator performs so-called manual control of an object and the
control process takes a short time (less than 5 minutes). During failures. the
control object becomes somewhat different for the human operator. Time for "adap-
tation" to the "new object" is needed in order to maintain the previous control
quality. The adaptation time for the mentioned processes can comprise a signifi-
cant part of the time for the entire control process. Its reduction is therefore
an important task for ergstic control systems. One of the methods for reducing the
"adaptation" time ta is visual depiction of the main properties of the control
object (for example, tables of a ship's maneuver characteristics [3]. etc.). This
may be a graphic relationship, or any other picture illustrations which permit
unequivocal illustration of the necessary data. Images on cathode-ray tube screens
are the most valuable. They permit rapid illustration in a real time scale of

the characteristics depending on the technical condition of the control object and
the formed situation. For ergatic systems with manual control, it is convenient

to depict in axes associated with the control object the quantities of the control-
ling factor developed by the control units. depending on the deviation of the
control lever from the neutral position. He will call this graphic picture 06?,
"diagram of controlling factors."

In order to clarify what has been said, we will examine a simple ergatic system
of compensator tracking (fig l). The human operator sees in the visual indicator
errors ex. 2 which are proportional to the deviation of the center of mass of the
control object from the zero position in the OXOY coordinate system (fig 1. b. d).
By deviating the control lever in the necessary erection. the human operator
creates the controlling factor T which is proportional to deviating the control
lever from the neutral position Tx-cé. TY-cy (fig 1, c d). Thus. the human opera-
tor manually controls the object with the task of keeping. for example, the error
modulus c ,c less than the assigned value x (i.e.. tracking with the assigned
accuracy X).y It is easy to see that under the conditions stipulated above. the
orientation of the T vector of the controlling factor coincides with the orienta-

tion of the R vector of the control lever deviation, i.e.. B-o.

If we now fix the vector modulus R and change the angle of orientation o-0-360.
then the end of vector T outlines a curve in the plane of associated OXY coordi-
nates whose visual depiction we will call the diagram of controlling factors. The
DC? prov'des a graphic idea regarding the quantity of the controlling factor in
the direction of control lever deviation. In our case. DCF will have the appear-
ance of a circle with radius proportional to the deviation of the control lever
from the neutral position.

We now assume that a malfunction develops in the control system (fig 1). As a
result. the component Ty of the controlling factor is reduced by 1/3: Tx=c6. TVs
0.66 cy. In this case. the DCF will be considerably altered. i.e., the quantity

of the modulus of the controlling factor and the angle of orientation of vector T
will change. i.e., Bid. For this case. figure l.e presents the DC? where the

human operator is given a DCF. As we see, the knowledge of the DOE by the human
operator significantly reduces the adaptation time. The experiment was conducted
for an object of the second order without damping for the sinusoidal input signal.

He will examine a more complicated case. Assume that the control object has con-
trolling devices whose actions are equivalent to the action of the three controlling
units located at distance r from the center ofmass at angle [20' to each other
(fig 2.a). Assume that the components Tiy and T13 of the controlling factors of
each controlling unit are proportional to the y and 6 components of the vector of
deviation of the control lever. Then the orientation of vectors T coincides with
the orientation of vector R. i.e., 8 Id, correspondingly. the total vector of

the controlling factor T (applied in the center of mass) has an orientation which
coincides with the orientation of vector R of the control lever deviation. i.e.

8:0.

It is easy to note that under the conditions stipulated above. the control system
for the human operator will be two-channel. The control object is moved in the

OXOYO plane without changing its orientation. i.e.. o-const.

We assume that a failure has occurred. resulting in component T yI0. This results
in the appearance of an expanding moment which disrupts the origntation of the

control object (diconst). and naturally. the control system becomes three-channel.
i.e., now the human operator needs to compensate for the change in o and take

this into consideration in the control. Experiments show that the quality of
control in this case is drastically diminished. It is therefore expedient to ful-

fill (in relation to the control channels) the principle of "stationariness" [1].
Assume that the expanding moment has been compensated for. for example. by the
introduction of additional signals into the laws of controlling components T1”,
i.e.. T x-c6+ky (where the coefficient k is defined from the condition of compen-

sation for the moment). As a result. the control system with T yIO will again
remain two-channel. Analogously to the previous case (fig 1). only the modulus
of the general vector T ofthecontrolling factor will change for the human operator,

and the condition 8-0 will be disrupted.

The 00? obtained for this case (fig 2,b) is significantly altered. Thus. the axis
y'y' on which the displacement angle A-o-d equals zero is seemingly turned to angle
d. For comparison. on fig 1. e. these axes coincide with the direction of the
assoeiated axes. Experimental data for time of adaptation to the examined

failure show a significant advantage if the human operator knows the DCP. Figure
3.c presents values of mathematical expectations for the adaptation time in the
presence and absence (hatched part) of information regarding the 06?. Decrease in
Hlt [. as we see. is significant. It should he noted that for certain versions

of failtres in the system of figure 2. the quantity of Hlt ] when the human operator
knows the DCF was less than 501 of the Hlta] of "adaptation" time in the absence of
DCF.

Thus. as shown by the experimental data. even for the examined. fairly simple
control objects. visual presentation of the DC? in ergatic systems is very useful.
especially in control systems in which the controlling factor is formed by the
total action of many controlling units. In this case. if individual controlling
units fall. the human operator who makes a decision on object control is not always
able to mentally imagine how much the DC? was distorted as compared to the original.
In preparing a decision for maneuvering. etc.. it may happen that planned maneuver-
ing is only possible with a definite orientation of the object (DCF) to the

plane of maneuvering. Consequently. knowledge of the DC? makes it possible to do
this. As a result. the active role of the human operator in decision making is
increased. and the quality of control of the ergatic system as a whole rises.

SUMMARY

[Text] A survey is given of the current status of the problem of investigating
individual features of the voice and automatic speaker identification systems.

The book is intended for scientific workers and specialists working on equipment
for vocal communications and man-machine contact.

FOREWORD

The necessity of developing automatic systems for speaker identification by voice
is chiefly dictated by practice. Thus. for example. it is necessary to confirm
(verify) a particular individual at control and admission points in order to
ensure the admission of only a limited group of persons to the controls of special
purpose mechanisms or to different information systems. what is more. the problem
of automatic identification of the individual voice is of great significance in
solving a number of criminalistic problems and in military matters. particularly
in electronic reconnaissance. etc.

On the other hand. these questions are closely related to automatic identification
of the semantic content of speech and the necessity of developing improved systems
for machine recognition of verbal utterances (by eliminating individual variation
of the voice as an impeding component) or. on the other hand. by constructing
devices tuned to the individual voice of a speaker (for the purpose of abstracting
from individual coloring of the voice).

Despite the urgency of such tasks. it can he said that not all our specialists are
yet aware of the importance of research on the individual properties of the speech
signal. At the same time. great attention is being given to these questions
abroad (for example. in the USA and Japan). It is enough to indicate that at the
present time dozens of prominent foreign centers financed by military. Justice or
commerce departments are working on automatic speaker identification. At the

45 ’

present time many of these studies are already being widely discussed from the
perspective of their concrete practical application.

The undertaking of the present book is to familiarize the Soviet reader with this
problem and to facilitate more active and effective interest in it. The
publication of such a book is also Justified by the fact that there is still no
work in the specialized literature which correlates in accessible form all
questions associated with the solution of this problem. The author's monograph
"The Speech Signal and the Individual Voice'I (published by "Hetsniyereba'
Publishing House. Tbilisi in 1916) is devoted to the investigation of individual
properties of the human voice and deals with only those questions on the solution
of which he himself worked. It did not set the goal of presenting everything that
had been done in this field and reflected in the specialized Soviet and foreign
literature.

Meanwhile. the demand for information of this type unquestionably exists. It is
needed not only by specialists engaged in technical cybernetics but also hy a
wider scientific community which wishes to become more closely acquainted with the
literature on pattern recognition. especially auditory patterns which are closely
associated with the nature of human sensory perception.

He would like to believe that this book will to some extent be capable of filling
the existing gap in publications of this nature.

INTRODUCTION

In everyday life we constantly encounter the fact of recognition of peeple by
their voices alone. You ring the doorbell. Behind the door they ask, "who is
there?" You answer involuntarily. "It is I." not thinking that the pronoun "I"
does not contain information on concrete identity. You subconsciously present the
listeners with your voice as an object for identification.

Just as often people identify each other by voice alone when talking by telephone.
listening to the radio. etc. For the blind. the voice is the sole means of
speaker recognition.

It is interesting to note that even newborn children have the capacity to
recognize voices. principally their mothers'. as has become known from the
research of psychologists. This fact demonstrates that man is not born entirely
unprepared-he is equipped with the functional capacities necessary to meet his
vital requirements as early as this period of development.

what is the problem of building systems for automatic voice identification? The
solution of this problem necessarily presumes preliminary analysis and
establishment of parameters in accordance with which classification of individual
voices by machines must take place. The basic complication here consists of the
fact that the person speaking must be recognized: identification occurs as he
talks. But this means that one and the same source has several different
functions; one and the same elements characterize both the uniqueness of voices
and the transmission of semantic information. Thus, far from one factor
influences and is responsible for the different specific characteristics of a

66

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

speaker's voice. In beginning analysis of this complex. integral system. the
first thing that we can say apriori and indisputably by virtue of its obviousness.
is that the speaker's voice is governed by the anatomical properties of his
articulation apparatus.

The fact that. as a rule. we are capable of distinguishing a child's voice from an
adult's. a young person's from an old person's and a man's from a woman's is due
precisely to the anatomical and physiological features of the vocal tract. Each
defect in the corresponding organs is reflected and makes itself known in the
speaking voice (burrs. lisps. nasality. etc.).

But. as we have already said. reducing the individuality of the voice to merely
the physical (or biological) properties of this apparatus is. of course.
impossible. These properties are most important. however they do not alone
determine the character of a speaker's voice. The fact that not only biological.
but also social. patterns and social determination of any kind of human activity
are of significance here. is as important. Speech activity is the specific
capability of man which initiates social experience and. in so doing. the
insurmountable abyss between man and animal.

Individuality always forms under the conditions of a particular society. The
person's contact with the outer world. the development of different strategies in
the struggle for existence and the formation of his mental potentialities and his
individual consciousness are accomplished under these circumstances and through
them. It is precisely this circumstance that gives man absolute uniqueness.

An important condition for the feasibility of social experience is man's capacity
for language. Accordingly. the task of transmitting semantic information is the
main and most important function of speech. The acoustic aspect of speech is
adapted~to fulfilling precisely this function. For exactly this reason aural
language is people's primary means of communicating with each other. All other
types (written language. the language of deaf mutes. various codes. etc.) are
secondary in relationship to it. having developed on its basis.

What is more. together with semantic information. sound also carries information
about the speaker himself. his age. his sex. and also about his physical and
"inner." i.e.. mental. state.

Specifically. for example. the voice may convey specific emotions of the speaker.
his agitation. happiness. sadness. depression. fear. It may also convey his

attitude toward his interlocutor and toward the subject of the statement (for
example. an impression of horror or delight at a reported event or enthusiasm

for a solemn appeal). The sound of conversational speech may also contain
information about a person's more persistent mental properties. about certain
features of an individual's character. about his placid or nervous temperament.
It is on this fact that different physiognomonic and pathognomonic studies on

67

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

sound are based. The former attempt to establish the characteristics of an
individual's personality. and the latter-his current emotional state“).

In connection with this multifaceted information contained in uttered sound. the
fact that the vehicle of these functions and the source of such diverse
information are one and the same creates a particularly complex problem. At the
same time. the objective of building an automatic system for identifying given
auditory patterns requires segregation of data of one informational aspect from

those of other aspects such that the latter do not mask or drown out the needed
information.

what conclusion should be drawn from all the aforesaid? It would be most natural
to recognize that all characteristics of the vocal tract and all parameters of the
vocal signal without exception are subject to speaker differences. Hence. in
turn. the converse conclusion-namely. that it is scarcely possible to find speech
characteristics which participate exclusively in the formation of the phonetic
qualities of sound and are unrelated to the properties of the individual voice.
and vice versa. For example. while we assume that an individual can be identified
by such a criterion as vocal timbre. here it should be remembered that the timbre
of a sound. which constitutes the distribution of energy along a spectrum. is also
the basic criterion for distinguishing different sounds-phonemes. It is much the
same with other criteria. say. with the manner of pronunciation (accent.

dialectal pronunciation) or even with speech defects, for example stuttering or
burrs. But at the same time. it is obviously also necessary to take into
consideration the fact that the latter properties are manifested in a certain way
in a specific context. i.e.. with certain phonemes, syllables or words. Even such
pathological properties of phcnation as nasality or lisping cannot appear
constantly against the background of all sounds.

' Studies on physiognomonics are usually conducted along the lines of
psychological research. particularly characterological studies. For example.
Rudert (187) studied the conversational voice from the perspective of the
variation of tonal pitch and rhythm of the process. By rhythm was meant the
segmentation of speech by pauses between syllables. words and phrases and
accentuation of components. Consequently. he divided the test subjects into two
types: a "melodic class” and a “rhythmic class.‘ associating corresponding
character traits with these voice types. Among other things. he considered
sharply segmented and dynamically accented speech to be a "militaristic" type of
speech characterizing a more resolute set of personality.

Also well known are the studies of other authors who tried to determine. on one
hand. the acoustic properties of an individual's speech and. on the other. certain
features of his character. which were studied using various psychological methods.

It cannot be denied that sometimes we actually draw certain conclusions about a
speaker's character from his conversational voice. Elevating this to a universal
principle. however. and expecting that character may be determined on the basis of
vocal properties. does not seem to us to be valid or to inspire confidence in the
approach to facts from the perspective of scientific exactingness.

For this reason. most specialists in automatic voice identification naturally use

basically the same speech parameters and characteristics as those died by
specialists in speech diagnosis.

In this case. what. then. is the invariant in solving a given task? How does
auditory perception solve the problem of distinguishing information streams which
are so closely related and interwoven in the physical properties of the speech
signal? '

It seems to us that the answer must be sought in thorough investigation of the
nature of the speech signal as a product of the action of the complex.
multifunctional vocal mechanism. Specifically this should mean that in
constructing automatic speech recognition systems one must keep in mind that those
elements of speech being identified which differentiate meaning must always be
studied under conditions of. and taking into consideration. the functioning of
their specific. i.e.. individual source. and conversely. in constructing automatic
voice identification systems one should keep in mind that the individual voice
must be examined under conditions of real speech activity. always bearing some
semantic information and characterized by certain dynamics of word pronunciation.

But how should this system of relationships be isolated from the interlacing of
the different systems which participate in speech?

In order to solve this problem. let us try to describe how human hearing
distinguishes. for example. the sounds of a desired instrument or singer from the
most complex auditory signal. corresponding to the playing of an entire orchestras
And how does man identify a familiar voice or speech occurring through a
communications channel with components which have highly nonlinear and nonuniform
frequency characteristics and which thus significantly change the spectral picture
of the natural signal? Finally. how is the "cocktail party effect'-consisting of
the fact that it is possible to follow any one of transposed private conversations
in society. tuning out all the other conversations-achieved (200)?

Obviously. such selection and identification is accomplished through the inner
consistency of elements which help us follow one integral system against the
background of others. The pattern. in the form of a complete whole. is
distinguished from the remaining background as a structure subject to a specific
pattern (the law of figure and ground in psychology).

Automatic recognition systems should assume the task of achieving an effect
analogous to human perception in this respect. Analogy to the laws of constancy
of human perception may prove to be of use in accomplishing this task. Thus. for
example. in the visual modality human perception succeeds in seeing and
determining white as such only by taking the general lighting conditions into
consideration. Otherwise. in shadow or on an overcast day white should be
indistinguishable from dark gray for our vision with respect to its physical
characteristics. and with full midday lighting black should be perceived as being
close to gray. But our perception. as it were. unconsciously takes into

49

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR Ol-‘FICMI. I'SF. ONLY

consideration the general lighting conditions and whether the color is appropriate
to the given object and interprets the true color of the object accordingly.

Thus. color perception is the complex product of the dynamic correlation of a
whole variety of phenomena.

Matters are also analogous with perception of the size and form of an object.
Hiscalculation of distance may transform a fly or spider on a window pane into a
monster on a mountain. as described in Edgar Allen Poe's tale "The Sphinx.”
Hiscalculation of the visual angle in looking through a hole in a piece of paper
at plates placed on a table will create the impression that the plates are not
round but oval. However. we do not make such mistakes because subconsciously we
always take the environment into consideration. i.e.. we do not look through the
"narrow aperture" but take various additional factors into consideration.

It has not been ruled out that something similar also takes place in the auditory
modality. Let us take as an example perception of a loud voice carrying from a
distance. It will be very difficult to trace the discernibleness of loudness to
the intensity of the sounds made since a sound carrying may prove to be physically
less intensive than a normal sound made by someone standing close by. Recognition
of the quality of loudness of a carrying sound must occur only if the remoteness
of the sound source and other conditions of articulation are taken into account.

In all these cases. perception of a given pattern (color. size. form. loudness)
occurs only by allowance for different features which are interconnected in a
system of relationships and produced in the form of a single integral pattern and
its environment. In precisely the same way. the speech signal is a complex of
simultaneously occuring messages of different types: the regular. dynamic system
of the interrelations of these messages creates the phonetic quality. on one hand.
and the specific nature of the individual voice. on the other. Hence it may be
said that only thorough investigation of the speech signal is capable of more or
less satisfactorily bringing us closer both to the goal of recognizing an
individual voice and to recognition of speech in general.

A given property must be determined by taking into consideration. and contrasting
to it. other components blended with it and not by filtering the latters. In
other words. in perceiving a given pattern it is necessary to take the environment
into consideration. and not to view this pattern through a "narrow aperture."
ignoring what often is capable of shedding light on its nature. In other words.
an object cannot be extracted from its environment and examined without reference
to its surroundings.

Such an approach to solving problems of perception in general and to perception of
speech in particular brings into the foreground and emphasizes the importance of
such procedures as normalizing procedures.

It seems to us that failure to take such factors into consideration explains why
the relevant devices recognize orders in the pronunciation of only a limited group
of voices and with standard characteristics of the signal transmission channel.
This also explains the fact that it is much easier to identify speakers when
standard speech segments are pronounced and under standard conditions than with an
arbitrary text and under conditions of any communications channel. any physical or

mental condition of the speaker. etc. .

Under the conditions of natural speech perception the listener does not care what
the person being identified is saying at a given moment or what his emotional
state is. In order to identify someone speaking to us by telephone. it would
never occur to us to force him to say some standard sentence. whereas fulfillment

of this condition is almost inevitably required for successful verification by
automatic systems.

It is now difficult to give concrete prescriptions for realizing integrated
systems for recognition of auditory patterns based on the principle of thorough
consideration of the diverse information included in the speech signal. At the
same time. with a number of practical problems it is sometimes sufficient to build
devices which will identify or verify a limited group of speakers with
predetermined reliability. In such a case methods of analyzing speech signals

which reflect only some given aspect of the manifestation of individuality may be
used.

Generally speaking. at this stage complete implementation of a comprehensive
approach is an ideal rather than a real possibility. and its realization is a
matter for the future. However. the one thing certain is that even today it is
necessary to be guided by precisely such an approach and to introduce gradually
features of system-integrated solution of individual problems. Some questions of
building speech recogntion systems with preliminary adjustment to the hunan voice
are covered in chapter 5.5. These questions. however. are examined not with the
object of disclosing the complex nature of human perception. which was mentioned
above. but with the intention of finding practical methods of realizing systems
for recognition of semantic information which would somehow use and take into
consideration the speaker's vocal properties. As will be demonstrated (chap 5.5).
such methods are often particularly empirical.

Nonetheless. based on cannon sense. they provide a definite increase in the
reliability of the functioning of speech recognition systems compared to analogous
systems which do not first examine the vocal charactersitcs of a specific speaker.

To the abovesaid it should be added that it was basically practical interest that
stimulated the development of most of the systems for speaker recognition by voice
described in our book. It must be supposed that consideration and study of
potentialities and the difficulties they face will make it possible to evaluate
the current status of the problem of automatic speaker identification by voice in
the best way possible and thus to note the basic ways to solve it. This is
precisely the basic objective of this book.

[Annotation, introduction and table of contents from book "Specific Laws of
Biological Regulation" by Geliy Aleksandrovich Kalimov, Boris Alekseyevich Karpov
and Viktor Vasil'yevich Zelenkin, Izdatel'stvo ”Nauka", 2600 copies, 135 pages]

[Text] Conceptions of structural organization and mode of function of biological
systems of the lowest level, their specific and nonspecific parts, are formed on

the basis of modern theory of automatic regulation. A mathematical model was
constructed of the system of adopting exogenous rhythms, which offers a mathematical
interpretation of the genesis of "prediction" and pathological phenomena caused by
an increased share of anticipation in the function of a system. Illustrations 36,
references 99.

Introduction

The law of regulation is a strict concept of theory of automatic regulation. Law
of regulation refers to the mathematical function, according to which the error
signal, which is the input signal of an automatic regulator, is transformed into
a controlling action. The law of regulation is entirely determined by the struc-
ture and parameters of the regulator, regardless of the complexity of design of
the latter.

The concept of law of regulation is also applicable to biological regulatory systems.
As in the general case, in a biological object the law of regulation is determined
by the structure of the regulatory organ, and it is a synonym for a means of

stable control of the system's state.

Physiologists have long since studied the regulatory function of organs and systems,
and it is unquestionable that one can gain profound understanding of the content

of processes in regulatory systems only if these processes are considered from the
standpoint of automatic regulation theory.

Evolution of the concept of reflex arc into the concept of reflex circuit

stressed even more distinctly the significance of theory of systems with feedback
(another name for regulation theory) to plysiologists. And ever since it was
learned that sensoperceptive processes are also a function of systems with feed-
back (Sokolov, 1958; Pribrsm, 1975; Zabrodin, 1976), it became simply necessary to
apply automatic regulation theory to physiology and psychophysiology.

FOR‘OFFNJAI.USE(MNLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLV

The first stage of merging of physiology with regulation theory was quite encourag-
ing. Horeover, long before the "official" unification of different science into

a general science of control (cybernetics), many researchers raised basic ques-
tions of theory of biological regulation. The authors of many works (Claude
Bernard, 1858; Samoylov, 1930; Bernshteyn, 1934; Anokhin, 1935; Cannon, 1937;
Beritov, 1961; Sherrington, 1969) have advanced, overtly or implicitly, the idea

of negative feedback, whereas in theory of functional system of P. K. Anokhin, the
idea of closed control acquired its finished form.

0n the basis of these achievements, it became a real possibility to turn from

the statement of general similarity of structures of biological and technical
regulatory systems to strict mathematical description of the concrete laws of
biological regulation. Many interesting linear and nonlinear models of biological
regulatory elements, different systems of the body and even man as a whole--human
operator--were published (Grodinz, 1966; Braynes, Svechinskiy, 1968; Milsum, 1968;
Stark, 1968, and many others). However, expressly such a large number is indicative
of the lack of profound understanding at the present time of the actual structure
of the controlling element in a biological regulatory system. Now, as before,
researchers are often compelled to resort to the concept of "specificity" of biolo-
gical laws of regulation, which implies. in essence, that these laws cannot be
reduced to categories of precise sciences.

In the book offered to the reader's attention, an effort was made to overcome the
chronic difficulties of merging physiology with automatic regulation theory. This
problem is solved in two main directions.

The first direction is developed in the second, "General Properties of Biological
Regulatory Systems," in which analysis is made of the distinctions of structure,
Statics and dynamics of biological regulatory systems. There too, the most diffi-
cult problems are resolved with respect to conformity of the main elements of bio-
logical regulatory systems with the basic conceptions of automatic regulation theory.
Such "difficult" questions include, for example,thoseof the input and output

points in the system of regulation, the master [driving] element, closed and open
systems of regulation. Special attention is given to the problem of "anticipation"
[prediction], which is sometimes interpreted from the anthropocentristic point of
view and causes the greatest basic difficulties in mathematical modeling.

The second direction, construction of concrete dynamic models with rather general
pr0pcrties, is developed in the other two seetions of the book. The section,
"Structural Features of Lowesc Automatism," deals with algorithmic description of
the simplest and most widespread biological regulatory mechanism. A hypothesis
is expounded on the basis of comprehensive analysis of the properties of this
mechanism concerning the form of interaction between specific and nonspecific
regulatory systems of the organism.

In the section, "Following Rhythm in Biological Regulatory Systems," a model is
constructed of the regulatory system of rhythm following, which offers a mathematical
interpretation of the genesis of “anticipation" in biological objects. This model
combinesthe properties of already known models, constructed for cases of tracking
predictable and unpredictable signals. Analysis is made of pathological phenomena
related to increased share of anticipation in control.

This book is intended for physiologists and psychologists with adequate training

in the area of automatic regulation theory. The last two sections may be of inter-
est to neuropathologists and psychiatrists, as well as specialists in automatic
regulation theory.

There were some digressions from concise presentation, so that the sections were
constructed in such a manner that bypassing the reading of purely mathematical
material would still enable the reader to assimilate the main ideas without any
special mathematical education.

Chapters 1-4 and 9 were writtln by G. A. Kalimov, and Chpaters 5-7 by all of the

VISUAL SITUATION SIMULATORS IN AIRCRAFT TRAINERS

1978 (signed to press 4 Oct 78) pp 2-4, 163

[Annotation, foreword and table of contents from book "Simulators of Visual
Situation in Aircraft Simulators" by Valeriy Sergeyevich Babenko, Izdatel'stvo
"Mashinostroyeniye", 1330 copies, 143 pages, illustrated]

[Text] This book deals with the general principles of modeling the visual situa-
tion in aircraft trainers and simulators. Simulators of the visual situation based
on principles of physical and mathematical modeling are given theoretical validation.
The principles involved in construction, distinctive features and direction of
development of visual situation simulators are described. This book is intended

for engineers and scientists. It may also be useful to students of the relevant

specialties.

Foreword

In recent times, increasing use is being made of the modeling method to solve many
problems related to the design and operation of aircraft, training and screening
of flight personnel, research and optimization of the pilot-aircraft system, etc.,
and various models and complexes are being developed. Among them, there is a
group of simulating devices that plays an important role, by means of which the
main features and processes of flight and aircraft control are reproduced on

the ground (with some degree of accuracy). This group includes trainers and
simulators of aircraft.

Aircraft simulators, which are sometimes called modeling units [benches2], are
designed to study and optimize aircraft performance and operation of equipment
installed on them in the course of design and production; aircraft trainers are
used to develop skills in flying and working with the equipment of series-produced
aircraft. Use of aircraft simulators in designing aircraft and aircraft trainers
for pilot training permits the following:

1) Reduction of testing (training) time as a result of refining processes
referable to any phase of flight without performing the other phases; possi-
bility of stopping a flight at any time with return to the base state,
working independently of meteorological conditions, etc.

2) Increased effectiveness of studies (training) thanks to deeper refinement
of flight processes under difficult conditions with diverse malfunctions,

even emergencies [accidents]. as well as because of more complete and
objective recording and processing of flight results.

3) Increased economic effectiveness of design (training) due to lesser ex-
penditure of fuel, less wear and tear on equipment, less expenditure on
maintenance of equipmert, etc.

4) Reduced load on airports caused by test (training) flights, relieving
aircraft and pilots previously involved with such flights.

5) Increased safety of tests (training), less environmental pollution by
fuel exhaust. lower acoustic effects on objects and people in the airport

area, etc.

the use of aircraft simulators and trainers does not rule out the need for test
and training flights in aircraft; however, a significant part of flight practice
is already being transferred to simulator systems. In the future, in connection
with the development of new multipassenger and high-speed aircraft. as well as
flights under difficult weather conditions and refinement of simulator devices,
the role of aircraft simulators and trainers will grow even more.

Modern aircraft simulators and trainers consist of many subsystems: simulators
that imitate the operation of various devices aboard aircraft and influence on
the environment, equipment for interaction between the test pilot (instructor)
and simulator system and pilot, etc. One of the most important subsystems of
aircraft simulators (trainers) is the simulator of the visual situation (SVS),
which simulates the external visual picture of the space visible to the pilot
from an aircraft cabin during flight. Problems related to visual flying can be
solved by means of SVS in aircraft simulators and trainers.

lhis book deals with a wide range of questions related to theoretical validation
and technical execution of SVS for aircraft trainers (simulators). The first part
of the book (first and second chapters) deals with the general principles and
theory of simulating the visual situation. The second part (third-fifth chapters)
is concerned with the principles of construction and distinctions of optical-
mechanical, cinematographic and television SVS and SVS with electrical synthesis
of images based on substantially different engineering principles. It concen-
trates primarily on simulating the visual situation in a complex aircraft trainer
for pilots at the take-off and landing phases. In principle, in view of the

and purpose, initial, limiting and other conditions, the main conclusions can be
transferred to other instances of simulating the visual situation: in aircraft
simulators, other types of aircraft trainers, for other crew members, etc.

[Text] The book analyzes particularities of the formulation and develop-
ment of various dynamic deviations in psychopathic personalities:
psychopathic (charscterolcgical) reactions, compensations, and
deconpensations. Certain variants of abnormal personality develop-
ments are also examined -- paranoic and sychogenic (post-reactive),
and psychopathic (pathocharactemlogical . Questions relating to
the forensic-psychiatric evaluation of these deviations are also
addressed. The book is written for psychiatrists, pediatric
neumpathologists, lawyers, and specialists in allied disciplines.

Research relating to the historical development of the study of psycho-

pathy OLA. Chalisov, 1950; 0.V. Kerbikov, 1958: O.V. Kerbikov and L.L. Rokhlin,
1961: A.G. Galach'yan, 1965) has established that at the end of the previous
century (70's and 80's), when the very foundations were developed, psychopathy
was ascribed a static nature, and its genesis was viewed as lying outside any
causal relationship with the environment. Those conditions which today are
treated as psychopathies were described with various titles: "degenerating
characters" (Ph. Final, 1809), "moral insanity" (Prichard, 1835), and mm
the latter half or the XIX century, as "degenerative" and "constitutional“
psychopathies.

11: must be noted that the authors cited were then discussing the inconstancy of

various character anamolies and the possibilities of congenitally based onsets of
various illnesses. They were, however, far from the contemporary concept of psychopathy
dynamics, and those opinions which they advanced bore an episodic nature.

The term ”degeneration" owes its origin to Morel (1857), who, relying upon the law
of continuous transformation of the species, concluded that deviations from the
normal hman type might occur in specific families over a number of generations and
result in deterioration, or degeneration. Psychopathy was viewed as unchanging over
the course of the individual's lifespan. The theory of degeneration impeded the
study of the dynamics of psychopathy for a considerable period of time.

A body of psychiatrists began to view the study of inherited or hereditary pre-
disposition as a science, an "illuminating the world" science regarding the causes
of all psychic disorders. The study was supported and developed by Schule (1878),
Schnitzer (1921), Hinkowska (1923), Schneider (1923, 1958), R.Ya. Golant (1929),

et al. In Soviet psychiatry, these views at a particular point in time were shared
partially by V.P. Osipov (1931), [ML Amenitskiy (19311), 2.A. Solov'yeva (1935),

et a1.

Morel's concept was also embraced by LL. Koch (1890), who wrote in his initial works
that the chief factor in cases of psychopathic inferiority was an "inherited
degenerative condition," remaining constant over the entire lifetime. Emever,

in his later works, the author indicated that psychopathic conditions might not only
be of congenital origin, but acquired as well. The very concept of psychopathy found
in his work was extremely broad, and was associated with certain stages of mental
disorders, considering that only quantitative gradations existed between psychosis
and psychopathic inferiority.

The question of psychOpathy dynamics was not reflected in Kraepelin's (1913) work.
If in the study of nosological forms, Kraepelin differentiated the course of the
disorder, i.e., examined them in a dynamic context, then in the describing

of psychopathies, he departed from this principle. Psychopathic personalities,
according to Kraepelin, were individuals with congenital "psychic malformations"
which were considered constant throughout their entire lifetimes. The
classification of psychopathies advanced by Kraepelin was extranely complex and
unwieldly; it included with the clinical groupings such variants of psychopathic
personalities as "liars", "asocial", and "rogues". Such congenital and unvaryins
psychOpathic deviations were retained in the thinking of LA. Sikorskiy (1899),
Kraft-Ebing (1903), S.A. Sukhanov (1907, 1912), V.P. Serbskiy (1912), Bleuler
(19111), A.S. Griboyedov (19111), Jaspers (1923), Ewald (1923), Dupre (1925), H.P.
Kutanin (1926), Birnbaum (1926), Delmas (1932), and S.N. Davidenkov (19117).

K. Schneider (1923), particularly in his first works , ascribed great significance
to biological factors in the formulation of psychopathies. He considered that
they constituted the basis for congenital anomalies. In his last works, published
in 1958 and 1959, the author recognized to a certain degree the role of external
conditions, but in the concept of ”social conditions", he included different
content (infections, accidents-trauma, alcohol, living conditions), and did not

dwell upon social relationships in the broad sense of the word. In all of his
works devoted to psychopathy, Schneider treats psychOpaths as individuals who,
as a result of their pathological peculiarities suffer. themselves. or force those
around them to suffer.

The static nature of psychOpathy was emphasized to even a greater extent by the
adherents of the constitutional-biological school. One of its most fervent
proponents was Kretsciner (1920), who advanced the concept of the dependence of
characterological peculiarities upon the physical constitution. From the position
advanced by this theory, Kretschmer isolated two types of constitutions: the
cycloid and the schizoid, and attempted to allocate all pathologic temperaments
or natures to those categories. Psychopathies, in his opinion, were congenital
conditions, remaining constant, and totally independent of the effects of any
external factors. According to this theory, man is born with inherited tendencies
toward the future psychopathy, and the latter I'thunder out" at a particular point
in life. Despite the groundlessness of this concept, which reduced the entire
human typology to Just two variants, a considerable number of psychiatrists

(R. Birnbaum, 1915, 1933: K. Schnitzer, 1921, 1923; T.I. Yudin, 1928: 14.0. Gurevich
and M.Ya. Sereyskiy, 1928; ILI. Sklyar, 1931: and Hoffhmn, 1932) adhered to it for
many years.

In the opinion of the constitutional concept adherents, the dynamics of psychopathy
constituted only an exacerbation of the psychopathic personality traits, the origin
of psychOpathic reactions, aental disturbances as defined by the type of consti-
tution. The very indications of psychogenesis associated with a conflict situation,
and the development of pathological personality traits served than as justification
for the diagnosis of psychopathy. For example, no. Gurevich (1913. 1928) spoke

of the "invariability of the constitutional character structure", but the stability
of psychopathy and the absence of the ability to compensate he incorporated in

his definition of psychopathy.

Abroad, a number of authors considers that psychopathy can only be established

in those cases where characterological peculiarity traits are manifested in early
childhood and remain more or less unchanged thrOughout life (Gland, 1932-,
Henderson , 191:2; Gruhle, 1952; Petrilowitsch, 1960: Guze, Perley, 1963: et al.).

In the appreciation of a segment of foreign scientists, psychopathy remains constant
under all circumstances. Certain researchers negate psychopathy as a nosological
entity. Wirch (1955) considers that no specific premise is required for psycho-
pathic behavior, as that behavior is occasioned by a specific predisposition, and
not by external events, for even with favorable conditions present, a psychopath
will commit wrongful acts.

Karpman (19108, 191i9), replaces the term "psychopatmr" with “anethomthy”, asserting
that psychopaths despite all attempts to alter their nature, remain obtuse, ego-
1stic, indifferent, and generally, unchanged with all the efforts. As a preponent
of the "psycho-dynamic" school, Karpman employs the word "dynamics'. In his
opinion, the concept of the "psychopathic personality" should be rmved from

scientific nomenclature. Kaxpman's successors (Miller, 1951; H. McCord, J.
McCord, 1956: Donnelly, 196%: et a1.) establish various criteria to define

psychopathy, incorporating as their basis traits of asociability (absence of
conscience, guilt feelings, love, etc.).

were noted long ago. During the period in which psychopaths; was viewed as a
congenital and immutable condition, individual authors, both native as well as
foreign, expressed the idea of the necessity for studying psychopathy in a

psychiatrists, primarily by no. Kandinskiy (18b3, 1890), who incorporated precise
clinical content in this concept. In the article "A Case of Questionable Conditiox
Before A Jury", V.Kh. Kandinskiy provided a vivid description of conditions, which,
from our point of view, must be treated as reactions by a psychopathic personality
within its characterolog: cal peculiarities. He demonstrated that these transitory
morbid conditions of "total mental disorder" were possible because they were nothin

more than temporary exacerbations of cannon conditions, which must also be toned
psychopathic conditions.

Emphasizing the relative nature of the concept of "constancy" in psychopathies,
V.Kh. Kandinskiy pointed out that the psychopathic condition itself bears the
conditions for its own progressive intensification, the onset of which is often
associated With fortuitous conditions. These Opinions clearly contain the thread

S.S. Korsakov (1901) emphasized in his works that the equilibriu- of psychopathic
constitutions, (i.e., psychopaths), was extremely easy to disrupt under the effect
of relatively insignificant factors, and in this respect, a tendency was manifested

or another in psychopathic personalities. Of interest here are the opinions ex-
pressed by S.S. Korsaloov on the possibility of compensation of psychopathic
peculiarities under favorable environmental conditions. He indicated that if the
fate of psychopathic personalities was "favorably organized", they night than
conduct personal and public affairs.

The Belgian psychiatrist, Delnas (1932) describes in a number of patients the

manifestation of ”disequilibrium" under the influence of unfavorable environmental
factors, which, in his opinion, may contribute to a ﬁxture formulation of

mo “CPU!" 0 ' U 1"I.‘ 0‘" V

psychopathy. The study by Deimas was developed by the Swiss psychiatrist Tuner
(19%), who termed the condition preceding psychopathy as "pro-psychopathic". The
work of Deimas and Tramer demonstrated that one of the stages which psychopathy
undergoes in the formation period is that of the I'pre—psychopathic" stage.

E. Kahn (1933) also wrote of the dynamics of psychopathy. He considered that the
personality consists of three strata-~inclination, temperament, and character, and
indicated in this respect that psychopathies are quantitative deviations in one or
all of those strata. The life of the personality is an uninterrupted concatenation
of psychopathic manifestations, periodically expressed to a greater or lesser degree
in the form of "accentuations" of psychopathic symptoms. External circumstances

or conditions play only a developing role, determining only the degree of the mani-
festation of the "neurotic superstructure". Proceeding upon these proposals,

Kahn concluded that the course of the life of a psychopathic personality was "the
course of life generally", and differed free the latter only by 'accentuations".

It should be noted that according to Kahn, psychopathy is a condition which is in-

herited and the environment influences the formation of the personality only to the
extent that the personality's constitution is capable of perceiving it. Thus, Kahn
describes psychopathic personalities as isolated from real life and emphasizes the

hereditary dependence of the phenomenon.

A isries of authors attempted to approach the question of p-tychopathy amics in
or- way or another, but only through the works of P.B. Gannushkin (1933 did the
dynamic principle of studying psychopathy receive convincing clinical foundations.
P.B. Gannushkin not only provided a definition for the concept of ”psychopathic
dynamics", but established apprOpriate limits as well.

The views of P.B. Gannushkin regarding psychopathic dynanics were more fully re-
flected in his book “Clinical Aspects of Psychopathy, Statics, Dynamics, and
Systematics". In the foreword to the monograph, he defined the bases for his
approach to psychopathies. He indicated that the psychopathic personality must
be studied in all its associations with the environment, in all its encounters
with that environment, in all its reactions and psychic contradictions, but must
always be studied as an integrated, whole entity. In the statics of psychopathy,
P.B. Gannushkin saw the "actual content of a subject", and in the dynamics, he
saw "chiefly the types, laws, and fomulas for the development of psychopathy".

According to his viewpoint, statics were very conditional and amounted basically
to the preservation of a known element of personality, whose background developed
special dynamics: psychopaths very easily react pathologically to psychic trauma,
to extremely difficult living conditions, and we observe in than particularly
exquisite and vivid pathopsychological developments (paranoid, neurotic), etc.

P.B. Gamushkin considered that under different conditions, psychopathic peculiari-
tics might be first sharply manifested, then remain virtually stable, and that
psychopathy frequently "attains the level of clinical fact only in the presence of
sufficiently intense external factors". The role of the external factor in the

clinical aspects of psychopathy, according to P.B. Gannushkin, has particular
significance as a developing agent for that which under different oondtions would

have remained latent .

Primary dynamic points in the life of the personality (pathological), according to
P.B. Gannurhkin are in the phase of reaction and development. As "reaction" he
understooa the manifestation of psychopathic syndromes, and the sharpening of
psychopathic symptoms as a response to various psychic stimulants. This type of
dynamics is undoubtedly one of the most freqent encountered. "Development" in his
opinion, is constituted by a series of reactions, which under the effect of repeated
shock based upon the mechanism of securing conditional reflexes, have a tendency
toward fixation.

Emphasizing the conditionality and relativity for such a subelement of dynamic
deviations, he pointed out that there exists sharp delineation between phases and
reactions on the one hand, and between reactions and development, there is none.

P.B Gannushkin reganded dynamic shifts or deviations as psychogenic reactions
(shocks, delayed reaction conditions), which are not particularly specific to
psychopathies, but can occur with any personality.

The opinions advanced by P.B. Gannushkin regarding the dynamics of psychopathy were
developed further in the works of other Soviet psychiatrists: P.M. Zinov’yev (1927),
V.A. Vnukovo (193M), N.I. Ozeretskiy (193k, 1938), A.Ya. Levinson (193k), V.I.

Akkeman (1937), A-“- Khaletskiy (1938), Ye.K. Krasnushkin (19'40), ILE. 01'th
(19514), and others.

Ye.K. Krasnushkin (19M0) spoke more decisively about the dynamics of psychopathy,
proposing that through the effects of external factors upon the personality, psycho-
pathy itself or a type might result. The social fern of psychopathic manifestations,
in his opinion, was most lnconstant and mobile, "here situational factors are at
work: the same psychopath under certain conditions is a pathological Jealous person,
and under other condtions is transformed into aconscientiousindividual, and under
still other conditions, a neurotic.'I

"The expressability of psychopathic traits is dependent upon the situation", wrote
Ye.K. Krasnushkin. He considered that.depending upon the situation, "previously
uncharacteristic qualities. contrasting qualities, might erupt on the surface of
the psychopathic personality". Against a background of a given constancy of
psychOpathic fonms, maintained over the course the life of the psychopath (in the
form of a given type of psychopathy), under the influence of the environment,
disturbances could occur.

The study of psychopathic personalities in a dynamic context was further reflected
also in the works of Ya.P. Frumkin (19h0), who wrote that psychopathic personalities
are relatively constant. Throughout the course of their lives, pathological traits
or characteristics may change or level off, or may vary depending upon factors

of the living environment.

A new stage in the study of dynamics in psychopathy was the work of O.V. Kerbikov
(1952-1965). The author advanced the idea that psychopathies might be not only
congenital (nuclear), but also "fringe or borderline", formed as the result of
pathocharacterological development. 0.V. Kerbikov demonstrated that the recognition
of the possibility of fringe psychopathy made the question of psychopathy .ormation
a subject for research. Here he focused attention on the fact that psychopathy,
forming over the course of 11fet1me,doesnnt erupt in the finished stage, but

81

a
can (\I‘nﬂ D ' Her 0""! V

undergoes specific developmental stages, including the initial, the pre-psychopathic
stage, which is characterized by the manifestation of characterological peculiarities
under certain conditions. During this period, the symptom of totality is lacking and
the ability for correct behavior maintained.

Duration of the pre-psychopathic stage is variable, and depends upon the type of
psychopathy: it is shorter with excitable types of psychopathy and is more signifi-
cant in inhibited psychopathic personalities. Psychopathic manifestations in this
stage are indistinct and unstable, dependent upon the situation or somatic state of
the patient, and the syndromes of any psychopathy (excitable, inhibited, hysteroid,
others) may replace one another or capriciously combine. .
The peculiarities of the pre-psthological stage, writes 0.V. Kerbikov, as with the
stage itself, are characteristic of psychopathic development, movable through the
effects of unfavorable living conditions: family upbringing, intra-family environ-
ment, extended psychogeneses.

In nuclear psychopathy, in the opinion of 0.V. Kerbikov, it is more appropriate to
address not pre-psychopathic stages, but latent psychopathy, which may be either
manifested or unmanifested by environmental conditions. He emphasized that in latent
psychopathy, the role of external factors is different--that of "developing,
modeling".

The study of the life course of psychopathic personalities led 0.V. Kerbikov and
V.Ya. Gindikin (1960, 1962) to conclude that a specific correlation exists between
characteristics of the psychopathically deformed personality and conditions under
which this personality developed. Thus, there is a connection between conditions
of upbringing and the formation of various forms of psychopathy.

0.V. Kerbikov emphasized that dynamics with various forms of psychopathies differ.
Additionally, he indicated that one mechanism may be observed in all types of
psychopathic personalities. That is the so-called psychopathic cycle, wherein

the psychopathic personality creates a conflict situation. This is often facilitated
by the onset of dysphoria (characteristic of psychopaths--unmotivated mood disorders
or disruptions, marked by sadness, malice, alans). The patient himself responds

with a pathological reaction to the conflict situation which he has created: that
reaction may take the form of psychopathic or charactenological. At its conclusion,
the psychOpathic personality discovers a strengthening of pathological traits which
are characteristic.

The merit of 0.V. Kerbikov lies not only in the fact that he isolated or identified
the "fringe or border" form of psychopathy, but in that he demonstrated that in the
field of minor psychology, the delineations between individual clinical manifesta-
tions not so much as differentiate as they combine these forum. In addition, the
author points out that the entire field of minor psychology is characterized by
change, dynamics, and the presences of transitional and intermediate fonms.

with the establishment of the "fringe" form of psychopathy, it became ssible to
discuss the reversible dynamics of these conditions. I.L. Kulev (1963 conducted
catamnestic studies of individuals with childhood diagnoses of: "psychopathy',
"pathological development", "neurotic reactions withpsychopathization",and others.
His research primarily related to a group of disorders tenmed "organic" psychopathiea.
Catamnestic study of the dynamics of these conditions indicated that in a majority of

cases, with increased age, an amelioration and disappearance of psychopathic traits,
equalization or leveling of psychOpathic peculiarities is observed primarily after
the age of 16, which attests to the considerable role the period of puberty plays in

psychopathic dynamics.

The dynamic approach to the study of psychopathy promoted the researching of the
psychopathic personality over the course of the entire life. Thus, V.V. Kovalev

_ (1973), is conducting research on the dynamics of psychopathv and psychocharactero-
logical development in childhood. V.Ya. Semhe (1967) studied the dynamics of psycho-
pathy in later age. The author notes that at the age of reverse development, a
transformation from one form of psychopathy to another is frequently observed. At any
stage of psychopathic dynamics in later life, the primary role is that of an organic
process (vascular and senile), and a lessening, in some cases a total disappearance
of psychopathic traits is observed as the result of new pathological characteristics
being manifested. At times, psychopathic episodes have occurred during this stage.

Forensic psychiatrists have made a considerable contribution to the study of the
dynamics of psychopathy. Progressive representatives of forensic psychiatry during
the period when the biological concept still reigned spoke against the static con-
cept of psychopathies. Soviet forensic psychiatry very early on adopted the dynamic
view of psychopathies.

N.I. Felinskaya (1963, 1965, 1971) devotes considerable attention to the study of
psychOpathy dynamics. Her clinic undertook a nmber of projects devoted to this
complex problem. N.I. Pelinskaya differentiates in the dynamics of psychopathv
temporary variances (psychological phases, deocmpensations, and psychopathic
reactions) and the more clearly expressed dynamics (pathological and psychogenic
personality development). Temporary changes, in her opinion, although they influ-
ence subsequent development of the psychopathic personality, do not determine its
path entirely. In pathological and pathogenic development, the dynamics are more
expressed and occasioned by the effects of psychogenic factors. With pathologic
development, these factors influence the formulation of a psychotic syndrome, and
in psychogenic, these transferred reaction factors are the beginning of pathological
character formation.

The possibility of psychogenic development occurring after transferred reactive
psychoses was confirmed in the works of 11.11. Gur'yeva (1963, 1971), and ILL.
Immerman (1969).

0.Ye. freyerov (1971), established the conditions of compensation and decompensation,
psychotic reactions, acute psychOpathic conditions, psychotic episodes, and patho-
logical development as versions of psychopathic dynamics, and in so doing, emphasized
the conditional aspects of those versions which he defined.

The study of psychopathic dynamics in the forensic psychiatric aspect has been the
topic of works by VA. Gur'yeva (1959, 1971), EN. Shostakovich (1963, 1971),
G.D. Volkov (1968), GJ’. Kclotilin (1968), V.K. Ochnev (1969), LP. Vasil'yeva

(1971), NA. Oprya (1971), LN. Stepanova (1972), V.Ya. Gindikin (1973),
Revenko, 11.6. (1971), and others.

V.A. Gur'yeva, studying the dynamics of psychopathy in Juveniles and youth, iso-
lated three basic stages in their fermation. The first stage was characterized by
a small range of syndromes, their elementary nature, and non-differentiation. The
second Features a process of complication and differentiation of clinical symptoms.
Finally, during the third stage, psychopathic traits undergo reinforcement and a
specific psychopathic structure is formulated.

B.V. Shostakovich evaluates "profound psychopathies“ as a variant of psychopathic
dynamics, and emphasizes the frequency of biological and psychogenic effects during
such in childhood.

As can be seen from the literature data cited, there exists many controversial

ideas in the study of psychopathic dynamics. There is no totally mutual under-
standing among psychiatrists as to the problem of differentiating psychopathic
reactions and decompensations. Certain authors treat psychOpathic reactions as
purely psychogenic within the confines of psychopathy, and not as dynamic deviations
of them. There exists no specific criteria for the establishment of paranoid
reactions and paranoid development of the personality occuring within the phenomenon
of psychopathy.

To the present time, moot questions exist regarding the psychogenic and psycho-
pathic development of the personality. Not all authors recognize the possibility
of the fonnation of borderline—fringe psychopathies. Questions have not been
fully developed regarding the forensic-psychiatric evaluation of various dynamic
deviations in psychopathies. All this has motivated us to correlate our own data
and to express our View point regarding this controversial problem.

PROBLEMS OF GROUP UNITY

(Annotation, foreword and table of contents from book "Problems of Group Unity" by
Aleksandr Ivanovich Dontsov, Izdatel'stvo "OSRDVSROSO universiteta, 4910 copies,
128 pages]

[Text] This book explores the unity [solidarity] of small groups and collectives;
it analyzes Soviet research on this problem, discloses the content of socially
determined joint object-related activity as the basis of group integration; it
criticizes bourgeois sociopsychological conceptions of unity. It is intended for
scientists in the field of social psychology, instructors, graduate and under-
graduate students on humanities faculties.

Foreword

At the present stage of the building of communism, studies of sociopsychological
aspects of formation and function of work groups are acquiring much importance with
regard to implementing the most important sociopolitical objective of a Soviet
society, that of joining the achievements of the scientific and technological revolu-
tion with the advantages of‘socislism. It was stressed in the summary report of

the CC CPSU to the 25th Party Congress that "The party and government require
investigation of problems related primarily to comprehensive development of industry
and control of industry, of recommendations that would permit increasing its
effectiveness substantially."* One of the pressing needs of such problems is that of
uniting groups: by providing optimum conditions for joint work, unity emerges as

a substantial factor of group productivity.

In recent years, the question of unity has become more and more often the subject
of special investigation in Soviet social psychology. Performance of a broad
front of concrete investigations makes it imperative to work out unified theoreti-
cal base principles, development of a general conceptual scheme of sociopsycholo-
gical analysis of the very phenomenon of group unity. Herctofore, insufficient
attention had been devoted to this matter in the Soviet literature. There are
several reasons why special theoretical work must be done in this direction. The
main one is that solving the problem of unity is one of the basic elements in
constructing general group theory--the most fundamental task for all of Marxist

social psychology. At the same time, experience in studying solidarity, which has
been gained by Soviet social psychologists, is extremely diversified and, to some
extent, contradictory, so that there is a need to generalize and specify, to con-
sider it in the light of the general methodological positions of Soviet psychologi-
cal science as a whole.

Nor can we fail to take into consideration the fact that the traditional conceptions
of the nature, and this means of experimental methods as well, of studying group
unity were formed within the framework of the positivistically oriented American
social psychology, and they were largely predetermined by its inherent internal
limitations. Under such conditions, critical analysis of the conceptual schemes for
studying unity, which prevail in the Vest, is necessary, particularly in order to
solve the problem, which is particularly acute because of the shortage of experi-
mental methods, of validity of using concrete methods for measuring the level of
group unity.

This group of reasons was involved in the special attention that is given in this
book to analysis of theoretical aspects of group unity. On the basis of such
analysis, an effort was made to single out the chief methodological principles

of investigating group unity and outline a single theoretical scheme for investigat-
ing integrative processes in groups. Examination of these issues served as the
starting point to prepare a program for experimental investigation of solidarity

of work groups, which was conducted on the basis of material referable to pedagogic
groups in secondary schools.

This author expresses his appreciation to L. K. Balyasnaya, candidate of pedagogic
sciences, deputy RSFSR minister of education, Prof G. H. Andreyeva and A. V.
Petrovskiy, member [active] of the USSR Academy of Pedagogic Sciences, for their
great help in conducting this study and their comments during preparation of the
manuscript.
