[Text] In our previous works, we demonstrated the possibility of fragmenta-
tion of T6 phage DNA by Econ! endonucleases [l], and we also obtained
several X-T6 recombinants with early and late genes of T6 bacteriophage [2].
This study deals with the characteristics of reconbinants carrying a group
of early genes 66, 65, 66 and 62.

It is known that nuclease is the product of gene 66 and that it is essential
to genetic recombination [3]; the product of gene 65 is required for replica-
tion [6] and transcription [5]. and the complex of 66/62 proteins is needed
for replication of T6 phage [6]. The protein 66/62 complex has DNA-dependent
ATPase activity. while the product of gene 65 stimulates the latter [6].

The ease with which the cloned EcoRI fragment of T6 phage DNA is isolated.

la well as its fixed position in relation to the well-studied markers of l
bacteriophage, makes it possible to investigate the fine physical structure
of phage 16 genes with the use of restriction endonucleases. The use of
data on physical napping enables us to define the orientation of the inserted
DNA fragment, and it also makes it possible to isolate individual cistrons
free the cloned group of genes.

It has now been established that several proteins of E. coli, such as poly-
nucleotide ligase. DNA polymerase, may be obtained in quantities that

are greater by a factor of 102 than those obtained with the use of the
ordinary sources of isolation thereof [7, 8] by means of 1-5. coli recom-
binanta obtained in vitro.

Consequently, it was interesting to determine whether the proteins of 16
phage are synthesized in the foreign environment of A phage, and whether
they retain their functional activity. The obtained recombinants would be
of particular value if we were able to augment production of T6 phage pro-
teins as a result of transcription from effective promoters of A phage. and

first of all from the powerful left promoter P1. In this case, the A-Tb
recombinanto could be used to obtain biologically pure (as a result of
cloning a specific group of genes) products of T6 phage.

6) hydrolysis of A596-8 phage DNA by NindIII endonuclesse
5) combined hydrolysis of A596-8 phage DNA by EcoRI and NindIII endonucleases

The following were used as markers of molecular weights: A-F. EcoRI fragments
of Acl857 phage DNA [13] and a-g, NindIII fragments of Ac1857 phage DNA [14].
The molecular weightsof NindIII fragments h (1.0 negsdalton) and i (0.8 mega-
dnlton), and Eco RI—NindIII fragments 8 (1.4 uegadslton) nnd Y (0.6 mega-
dslton) of cloned fragment 0 of T4 phage DNA were determined from the
calibration curve.

Recombinants A596-7, AS96-8 and AS96-20 [2] were cultivated on E. coli C600
cells and purified in a CsCl density gradient [2]. DNA was isolated by the
phenol method [2]. The DNA of recombinant: was hydrolyzed with EcoRI,
NindIII, Smai, BaaHI endonucleases. In the case of hydrolysis with EcoRI
endcnuclease, the DNA of all phages presented a fragment of 3.7 megadalton
(“5600 nucleotide pairs). SmaI and BamHI did not yield splitting in the re-
gionof theTb phage DNA fragment, and for this reason could not be used to

determine the orientation of the fragment. In the case of hydrolysis

by HindIII endonucloase, three restriction points were demonstrated in the
DNA fragment of Ta phage, and the DNA of all three phages presented identical
hydrolysis; consequently. all three presented the same orientation of the
fragment. In order to localize the sites of HindIII restriction, we used

the DNA of AS96-8 phage. Figure 1 illustrates separation of DNA fragments
formed upon complete hydrolysis by BcoRI endonuclease (2), complete hydro-
lysis by ﬂindlII endonucleese (4) and Joint hydrolysis by BcoRI and BindIII
().

Electrophoresis in agarose gel was performed as previously described. As

a result of cleavage of the Book! fragment 6 by HindIII enzyme, there is
formation of NindIII fragments h and i (Figure l, 4). In the case of
treatment of AS96-8 phage DNA with both EcoRI and HindIII restrictases, in
addition to fragments h and i, fragments of combined hydrolysis B and Y are
demonstrable (Figure l, 5). These results, as well as the results of
incomplete hydrolysis by NindIII endonuclease and a mixture of BindIII and
EcoRI endonucleases, make it possible to unequivocally map the sites of
Hindlll in the cloned DNA fragment of T4 phage as illustrated in Figure 2.
In this figure, in addition to the diagram showing the location of restric-
tion sites on A596-8 phage DNA, are illustrated analogous data for DNA
of phages AcI857, 1630, A596 and A596-35 [2], which we used as a control.

It was of considerable interest to determine whether the genes of Th phage
are expressed in the genetic environment of X bacteriophage and, if so,
from which promoter, A or 14, they are transcribed. It is known that the
molecular weights of the products of genes #6, AS, 64 and 62 constituted
~70,000, 27,000, 35,000 and 17,000 dalton, respectively. Consequently,

a DNA fragment 4000 base pairs in length is sufficient for coding all these
proteins. Having a cloned fragment 5f00 base pairs in length, we could
have expected that both end genes (46 and 62), or at least one of them,

are present in the form of a complete copy.

Demonstration of protein products that did not differ in molecular weight
from the proteins coded by 14* phase could be evidence of the presence of

a complete terminal gene. The proteins synthesized by A-Tb recombinants,
1‘6", TbsmBlO (gene 65), Themzllloo (gene 62), TbanNGZ (gene 106) and ThamN96
(gene 66) phages were studied in cells of E. tall 159 gal, uvr, su', which
were cultivated on synthetic medium [9] containing 0.61 maltose and vitamin
B, in a concentration of l us/mi. The cells, in a concentration of 2-10.,
were cooled, precipitated by centrifugation and resuspended in a concentra-
tion of 1010’ cells/ml; 4 n1 suspension was placed in a Petri dish and
exposed to ultraviolet light for 10 min while stirring it continuously.
Infection was produced with a multiplicity of 10. After 3 min, we added to
each specimen 10 uCi ’5S-methionine, diluted it 5-fold in warm medium and
transferred it to the incubator at 37°C. Infection with A-Tb recombinants
was performed for 20 and 60 min, and with T4 phages for 12 min; the culture
was cooled, the cells precipitated by centrifugation, eluted once in a
tris-hCl buffer (50 a“), pa 7.8, and stored in a frozen state at -20‘C. The
infected cells were suspended in 100 pl buffer containing sodium

control phages. For the study of expression of T4 phage genes, A596 phage
would have been the ideal control; it contains no DNA fragment between
EcoRI~l and EcoRI-S sites (Figure 2); however, such phage cannot exist in
the form of infective particles, since there is not enough DNA, as a result
of deletion of ninRS, for normal stacking of phage. Phage X430 differs
from such an ideal phage in that there is no ninRS deletion. Figure 3, 8
and 7, shows that AS96-8 and A430 have a considerable number of hands in
common. Moreover, A630 synthesizes two proteins that are not synthesized
by either X596-8 or the other control phage AS96-35, which contains a

DNA fragment of TA phage (genes 42, 9, 10, ll, 12) between the EcoRI-l and
Scent-3 sites (Figure 3, 6 and 8) [2]. Phage X596-8 codes the synthesis

of 5 proteins with molecular weights of ~65,000, 39,000, 27,000, 13,000 and
10,000. while A596-35 phage codes synthesis of 6 (100,000, 28,000, 26,000 and
26,000) that are absent after infection with A630 phage. It was demonstrated
that proteins with molecular weights of 65,000 and 27,000 of h596-8 phage are
completely identical to the proteins synthesized after infecting E. coli
cells with T6+ phage (Figure 3, 10) and absent in genes 65 (Figure 3. 9) and
66 (Pigure 3. 11) after infection with amber mutants. Figure 3 also clearly
illustrates increased expression of genes 65 and 66 after infection with
A596-8 phage. as compared to infection with T6+ phage. Synthesis of these
proteins reaches a higher level by the 60th postinfection minute

(Figure 3, 3 and 3).

After infecting E. coli 159 cells (Xind') that had been exposed to ultraviolet
light with X596-8 phage. the level of synthesis of products of genes 65 and
66 is much lower (data are not submitted). This serves as evidence of the
fact that their synthesis is controlled or related to transcription from one
or more promoters of X phage, and it also indicates that the promoter (or
promoters) of T6 phage contained in recombinant 1596-8 is either not recog-
nised at all by E. coli RNA polymerase, or else is weaker than the promoters
of A phage [12].

Our study enabled us to derive the following conclusions: 1) The cloned

fragment of T6 phage contains three restriction sites for Hindlll endo-
nuclease. 2) Using cloning in HindIII A vectors, it is possible to isolate

the individual genes of the studied DNA fragment of T6 phage. 3) A596-8
codes synthesis of the product of.gene 66, which does not differ from the
analogous protein of T6+ phage. This means that the recombinant contains

a complete copy of gene 66. 6) A596-8 codes synthesis of the product of

gene 65, with a molecular weight of 27,000, that does not differ in molecular
weight from the corresponding protein synthesized by T6 phage. 5) Beth
proteins are synthesized by recombinant 1596-8 in quantities that are
appreciably greater than those obtained after infection with wild type

T6 phage.

KINEMATIC CHARACTERISTICS OF SWIMMING IN CERTAIN AQUATIC ANIMALS

[Article by V. P. Kayan. L. P. Kozlov and V. Ye. Pyatetskiy, Kiev]

[Text] Data on the speed and kinematics of swimming of various fish and
cotaccans are of substantial practical interest in connection with the

fishing industry and may also be used in establishing hydrodynamic theories
of swimming.

Presented below are experimental data on the kinematics and swimming speed
of several types of fish and cetaceans of the afalina [Tutsiops truncatus
Hontagu] type. Studies with aquatic animals were made at the Institute of
Hydromechanics of the UkSSR Academy of Sciences in units especially designed
and constructed for this purpose-biobydrodynamic tunnels [1, 2], a circular
biohydrodynamic unit and a coastal hydrodynamic canal [3].

Fish that use undulating movements of the body as the method of swimming are
divided into three groups [4]: with an eel-like method of movement (there
are locomotor oscillations approximately equal in amplitude along the entire
length of the body), with a scombroid method (the amplitude of the locomotor
oscillations increases from the nose to the tail according to a definite law)
and with the "trunkfish" method (only the rigid caudal fin carries the loco-
motor function and the torso is immobile). Examples of two of the methods
of motion were studied: eel-like-garfisb, and scomhroid--bluefish, mullet,
bonito and trout. A description of the method of performing the experiment
and the equipment used. making it possible to record the elements of the
kinematics of the fish being studied, is given in [5-7].

In the biohydrodynamic tunnels [1. 2], experiments were performed during the
countﬁr motion of the fish. using the optomotor reaction appearing in them
an a reflex. The essence of this reaction is that of involuntary tracking
of a moving reference point by the eye and the entire body of the fish.

In the case being discussed, the fish swam against the water current and, in
heading for a reference grid on the bottom of the working part of the tunnel,
remained seemingly "immobile" with respect to the tunnel itself and to the

observer. in the circular unit [3]. a white screen with dark Vertical

stripes moving in a circle from the outer side of the circular canal
served as the reference point.

when analyzing the material obtained for statistical processing. only the
behavior regimens were selected in which no movements of the fish along
the long axis of the working section were observed. In these cases the
speed of the fish was constant and equal to the rate of flow at the given
point of the cross section of the working part of the tunnel. Because of
the fact that the profile of the speeds in the working section changed
substantially near the walls (up to 10 percent). the behavior regimen when
the fish being studied was near the wall were rejected. Despite the fact
that the level of turbulence in the tunnel was quite substantial. the
results obtained coincide well with the data from work [8]. obtained for it
in a so-called "fish wheel." where the level of turbulence was negligible.
as well as with the results when the fish swam at low speeds in a circular
biohydrodynamic unit. where the water was not moving. Therefore, the level
of turbulence in the fluid obviously has little effect on the values of the
kinematic parameters of the movement of aquatic animals.

The coastal hydrodynt‘mic canal in which experimental studies were made with
cetarcans of the ai’alina type was 65 meters long and had a square cross
section of la square meters. In the middle part of the canal. in a section
ll meters long. one of the side walls was made of glass. In order to record
the position of the subject of the studies at various moments in its passage
through the "working" section. on the opposite wall of the canal. black
against a white background. a reference grid with the units measuring

0.5 X 0.5 meters was drawn.

The elements of the kinematics of the swimming of the aquatic animals being
studied were recorded by a movie camera. In this case two Konvaa-Avtomst
type cameras were used. The filming was done on black and white negative
film 35 are wide with the frame measuring 16 x 22 mm. Selected for subsequent
processing from the experimental material obtained on the cetaceans' winning
were those behavior regimens in which the afalina's center of gravity shifted
horizontally close to the long axis of the canal.

in order to increase the time-reading accuracy. in the subsequent interpret-
ing of the frames. in the process of filming. an electric second timer was
placed in front of the glass working part within the contact angle of the
movie camera's objective. The regimens selected were processed graphically
and statistically by means of a Mikrofot-5 PO-l interpreter. In it. the
picture from each frame was projected on a diffusing-reflecting screen
measuring 360 X 300 mm.

For each experimental animal. at each instant. the amplitude "0 of the
oscillations of the posterior edge of the caudal fin was determined. and
for each operation the relation 50(6) was constructed. The period 2" and
frequency f of the oscillations of the caudal fin of the fish were also
determined from these same graphs.

Figure l.

‘lhe average values for the regimen of the frequency f and the amplitude Ag
were determined by methods of mathematical statistics in tabular form in
accordance with the system of processing equal-point measurements [9].

For all the fish the average reot-mean-square deviation in determining the
amplitude of the oscillation of the caudal fin was 5-7 percent and of the
frequency-«é percent.

Since the forward movement of the afalina-type cetaceans is distinguished
by its nonstationary nature. the values of A0 and 2' for them were deter-
mined as the average oscillations of the caudal fin for the period. At
each instant their forward speed V. was determined. and a graph of its
changes in time V52) was plotted. The average speed of the afalina for
the given period of oscillations of the caudal fin. as well as the value
and sign of the changes in speed were determined according to this graph.
The average root-mean-aquare deviation of these values in all cases did

not exceed 6-5 percent.

The relation of the frequency of oscillations [of the caudal fin of all

the aquatic animals studied to the relative speed of their winning V/l.

l'i'extl According to established opinion. respiration in dolphins of various
species (Tursiops trmcstus. Phocoens phocoens [porpoise]. Legenorhynchus
obliquidens) is of a purely voluntary nature. and in medication sleep.
induced by even small doses of various types of anesthetics. respiration

is completely cut off [1-5]. Only Pentothal sodium [5) or halothana [2. 3,
6] are used to anesthetite dolphins. with compulsory use of artificial
pulmonary ventilation. The use of succinylcholine. tranquilizers. other.
morphine or nitrous oxide to i-obilize and anesthetize dolphins has: been
acknowledged to be inadequate [2. 3, 5. 7, a].

0n the shore of the Black Sea we conducted a series of tests on anesthetis-
ing clinically healthy dolphins. adapted to the conditions of being kept in
a pen (at least one month after capture).

Using Pentothel sodium (with intubation) and then an inhalation anesthetic-
pentrsne--showed that this type of anesthesia is also unsuitable for working
with dolphins. Only in one experiment out of five on Phocoena phocoena did
the enimal emerge from the anesthesia with recovery of respiration and
reflexes. Its behavior in the course of the following days did not differ
from normal. in another experiment the animal perished when barbiturates
were administered. in two experiments with dolphins. after cessation of

the anesthesia. a temporary restoration of the respiratory reflex was
observed (individual respiratory cycles. opening of the blow hole). Com-
plete normalization of the respiratory action did not occur. however. and
the animal died. in two other experiments the animals emerged from the
anesthesia and almost cmlete normalization of the respiratory action and
swi-ing reflexes occurred. No hours later in both these cases. however.
respiratory disorders occurred and the animals died.

‘nenc experiments. as well as the data free a series of experiments made
earlier (in general unsuccessful) on the dolphins Tursiopu truncatus and
Phocoana phoeoena. using ditiliuum. Pentathul sodium and a number of other
preparations for immobilization. permit the conclusion to be drawn that the
intubation procedure. cutting off natural respiration and transferring to
artificial respiration lead to serious disorders in the coordination of the
respiratory action in dolphins. which necessitates the development of
special techniques for postanesthctic resuscitation for these animals.

Hhen studying the effect on dolphins of various anesthetics. we selected an
anesthetization procedure that would induce a simulated "natural" sleep.
sufficiently deep. without cutting off the respiration and disturbing the
coordination of the respiratory action. Favorable results were obtained in
experiments on two dolphins. Tursiops truncatua. each of which was anes-
thetized twice. In one case surgery was performed during the anesthesia.

The following methodology was used: premeditation--atropine (1.0 mg per
50 kg. intravenously) and Seduxen (5.0 mg per 100 kg. intravenously);
anesthesia--sodiun oxybutyrate (1.0 g per 50 kg intravenously). Droperidol
(12.5 mg/lOO kg intravenously) and Phentanyl (0.5 mg/lOO kg intravenously).

Control over the depth of the anesthesia and the general condition of the
aninsl was implemented through an axe. eyelid reflex, corneal reflex.
Klyap-reflex (contraction of the throat muscles when a foreign body is
introduced into the throat). tongue reflex. swimming reflex (tail movement).
pectoral fin reflex (to scratching the neck). blow hole reflex and the pain
reflex (to pricking the tongue with a needle).

Some 20-30 minutes after administration of these preparations, complete
relaxation of the animals. loss of all reflexes and a sharp reduction in
pain sensitivity occurred. The respiratory rate was 2-3 cycles per minute.
and the rate of cardial contractiona--60-70 per minute. The eyes were
closed or half-closed. The depth and duration of the anesthesia was suf-
ficient to perform major operations.

The gradual restoration of the reflexes began 1 1/2 to 2 hours after
administration of the preparations. After 3 1/2 hours the animal was

placed in n small tank. and then after complete normalization of behavior
was let out into the large tank.

[Text] The clinical criteria for delimiting psychopathies from other ferns
of borderline states, including neuroses. were formulated by Gannushkin
(1). After the concept of acquired psychopathy (pathological developnent
of the personality) was introduced into psychiatry. it became even more
difficult to distinguish psychopathies frost neuroses (2). As an exasple.
the possibility for a transition frou a neurotic state to pathological
development of the personality that clinically resesbles psychopathy has
been shown (3). In the opinion of c. K. Ushakov there are no fundamental
clinical differences between neuroses and psychopathies: There are
two-way bridges between neurotic and psychopathic reactions and states,
and between the characteristics of their developnent (4). Korolev (5)
describes six signs of a transition to developing neurosis. Thus the
problem of deliniting neuroses fron psychopathies continues to plague us
today (6).

The goal of the present study was to analyze the possibilities for auto-
matically (with the help of a coeputer) classifying neurotic and
psychopathic states and analyzing the most significant anasnestic signs
and clinical symptoms that make these states different.

The research was conducted on 358 case histories of persons hospitalized
within a 10-year period at the Hoscow Psychiatric hospital ineni 2. P.
Solov'yev (in the periods free 1945 to 1950 and fro: 1956 to 1960
inclusively) for reason of neurotic (with the exception of obsessive
neurosis) and psychopathic states. The ages of the patients at the time
or their admission were from 16 to 40 years. The case histories of 204
persons for who. we managed to obtain detailed catannestic information
were subjected to final nathsoatical analysis. Catannestic surveys were

perforated in 1977: The outpatient charts of Moscow regional polyclinics
and psychoneurological diepenssries servicing the zones within which the
patients lived were studied. eighty-three or the patients could not be
located, 24 were dropped in view of the absence or complete data, 34 were
excluded due to change in the diagnosis to schizophrenia, 4 were dropped
due to change in the diagnosis to organic lesion of. the central nervous
system (one case of eligophrenia and three of specific etiology). l was
excluded due to diagnosis of obsessive neurosis, and 8 patients died in
the period or catamestic observation (including one death by suicide).

During the ties of catannestic observation the psychepethy diagnosis was
changed to a diagnosis or neurosis and vice versa in particular cases.

The observation was qualified as a “neurosis" when a psychopathic syndrome
failed to reveal itself throughout the entire time of catannestic
observation.

neuroses and psychopathies differed significantly in relation to a number
of characteristics. Just this simple analysis alone (one not accounting

for the mutual dependencies of the characteristics) is enough to permit
computer classification.

The classification program was written by one of the authors (I. A.
burlahov) for the Minsk-J: computer. The principa method is the Bayes
strategy (8). The appropriate parameters were computed in relation to
samples (case histories) corresponding to each class (neuroses and psycho-
pathiee). This stage was called "computer teaching" (9. 10). “Teaching"
was conducted in two stages-"rough" to exclude characteristics providing
little information, and final. The information content of the character-
istics was assessed by means of a test accounting for Kul'bak’s concept
of information (ll) and Shannon‘s information theory (12).

The compuution results are printed out by the computer in the form of
tables of weight coefficients of the signs and the error probabilities
(percent of observations wrongly classified by the computer). Figure l

is a graph of classification errors depending on the complexity of the
approximating (approaching the empirical data) mathematical model. In
this case the classification errors pertain to observations made in 1958-
1960 as a control. Tranquilisers were broadly employed in eanatorium
wards during this time. When the entire group of neurotic or psychopathic
patients is used as the control, the percent error decreases correspond-
ingly to 6-9. This attests to erasure of clinical differences in response
to tranquiliser therapy. In the case where the sum total of signs obtained
from case histories was interpreted as a homogeneous group, it was
described by the density function of one eluentary distribution. Such

a group of objects is called a taxon (ll). when density functions of a
large ember of elmaentary distributions are employed. the existence of

a correspondingly larger number of taxons (subgroups of discrete objects)
is seemed. As we can see from figure 1, enlargement of the nuber of
subgroups does not noticeably change the percent classification error.

Figure 2 is a graph of information distances (weight coefficients) of the
dominant signs depending on the number of subgroups in the taxone. The
higher the weight coefficient, the higher is the information content of
the sign. in all taxone the sign “excitable traits in childhood” remains
within the group of dominant signs, and beginning with the second taxon
it is dramatically delimited. This agrees with both the definition of
psychopathy and the data of Table 3. from which we can see that in the
presence of psychopathies this sign is encountered with significantly
greater frequency (the difference is highly significant).

The information significance of the sign "incomplete family" is of
interest. It persists in the group of the six dominant signs in the

first, second. fourth. and fifth taxons. At the same time (see Table 3)
the frequency with which this sign appears is almost identical in the
presence of neuroses and psychopathies. The sign's correlation with others

[Test] One of the most pressing probless of neurosis therapy is that
of studying the conditions promoting optima, effective psychotherapy,
a significant psychological characteristic of which is tho lutuel rela-
tionship between the physician and the patient.

Many authors have concluded psychotherapeutic contact to be an important
therapeutic factor that often predetermines the success of psychotherapy.
(l-3). Developnsnt of scientific ideas concerning the therapeutic sig-
nificance of mutual relationships between physician and patient has
proceeded in parallel with evolution of psychotherapy as a lethod of

a physician's nental influence upon the patient. Representatives of
different areas of domestic nedicine have always devoted serious attention
in their work Iainly to the deontological aspects of the physician's
behavior in therapy “-7).

The authors of cost foreign works on the physician-patient relationship
problem traditionally concentrate their attention mainly on the unique
personality features of the patient and his ‘reactions to the physician
(8-10). As Freud's hypothesis concerning a patient's “transfer” of his
Oedipus complex to the physician evolved. psychoanalysts cans to recognise
the social aspect of coununication between patient and physician. and

the traditional psychoanalytical premise of a physician's paesiveness
and nonparticipation was rejected. But the essence of the problem
continued to be viewed as before. Scales and questionnaires are set up
for experimental research on physician-patient relationships and the
obtained eaterial is interpreted in many foreign works on the basis of
psychoanalytical premises, and thus they reflect shortccnings inherent to
psychoanalysis (ll-l3).

in Soviet psychotherapy. contact between physician and patient is
interpreted as a unique fore of social coenunication based eainly on
relationships of trust (2-3). when an experieentai psychological approach
is taken to this problem this interpretation of psychotherapeutic contact
requires the use of the categories of social psychology. to include set.

standard. role behavior. and eepathic cesmnication within the diadio type
of comanication (MAS).

The goal of the present work was to subject, to clinical-psychological and
experimental-psychological analysis. the unique features behind foreation
of psychotherapeutic contact between physician and patient. and its
influence on the effectiveness of psychotherapy and its optimum in the
treatment of neuroses. a special experinental psychological technique
was developed for this research (l6) . Directed interview and a physician
selection technique based on photographs of persons of different sex and
age were enployed to study the initial sets of the patients in relation
to the physician and the forthcoeing treatment. The features of mutual
perception of the physician and patient were revealed by means of a
technique arbitrarily called the "scoring technique” (selection and rank-
ing. on the basis of significance, of lo traits free a set of 54 qualities
characterizing the personality). This technique can also be used to
obtain the characteristics of significant persons within the patient's
mediate surroundings (father, nether, friend. supervisor at work,
colleague. and so on) and of his standard ideas about these people. By
comparing these characteristics with the physician standard we can reveal
the genesis of the image of the "ideal" physician. cenparable variants
of questionnaires and interviews. different ones for the physician and
the patient. were used to reveal the patient's and physician's evaluations
of the peychotherepeutic process, the dynaaice of their relationships.

and their degree of satisfaction with the contact and with the results

of treatment.

The object of study consisted of loo patients, 80 with neuroses and 20
with psychopathies of the psychogenic decenpensation degree. There were
46 men and 54 worsen; 53 patients were 35 years old or less, and 47 were
over 35: 58 had a higher education, and 42 persons had a secondary educa-
tion. The subjects distributed themselves in the following way in
relation to the forms of their illness: Neurasthenia was diagnosed in
33 patients, hysteria was diagnosed in 37. neuroses involving obsessive
states were diagnosed in 10, and psychopathy was diagnosed in 20. The
principal clinical syndromes accompanying the neuroses were anxious-
phobic (d5 cases), which do-inated in the group of neurotics suffering
obsessive states and hysteria, and the esthenic syndrole (24), which was
observed most frequently allow neurasthenic and hypochondriacal patients
(11 patientsl

therapists froa the department of neuroses and psychotherapy of the

The attitudes of the patients to the physician and treatnent prior to
nesting the treating physician were studied in the fleet stage of the
research. Every patient has a certain image of the ”ideal” physician
that could satisfy his need for help and for conunication of a certain
nature. Descriptions of the photographs were quantified by the content
analysis sethod (l7) . All patients noted. in their images of the “ideal”
physician, first of all the personality properties which reflect a.
emotional relationship of the physician to the patient. The declination
of characteristics typical of an empathic relationship of the physician
to the patient permitted definition of the emotional type of physician
standard as ”empathic.” When the degree to which this characteristic is
expressed was moderate. the physician standard was arbitrarily designated
as ”amtionally neutral.“ Presence or absence of volitional qualities

in the physician and statements by patients concerning the leading role
of the physician in contact supplemented the description of the “ideal"
physician by two variants. arbitrarily eased "directive" and “nondirective.”

The "empathic" type of physician standard was chosen most frequently by
hysterical patients (81 percent). This choice may be associated with

the greater need hysterical patients haVe for understanding and recognition
from surrounding individuals. The ”empathic.“ "directive“ variant was
preferred by neurotic patients with obsessive states (70 percent). The
reason for this choice lay in the fact that the pttients needed guidance.
lt reﬂected the hope of surtnounting indecisiveness with the help of the
physician's benevolent and strong personality. The “emotionally neutral"
type of physician was selected more frequently by neurasthenic patients
(54: percent) owing to their greater need for acquiring the quality of
self-control.

The physician standards selected by the patients were ooepared with the
characteristics of other real persons with the goal of determining which
of the images of people coating in contact with the patient cones close

to the physician standard. It was established that for nest patients

this standard is comparable with descriptions of sense of those persons
who are most authoritative in relation to the patient (mother, teacher.
and so on). Analysis of the standards of persons coming closest to the
physician standard permitted examination of the role played by the ”ideal“
physician and distinguish two variants of his rolenthnt of a guide,
which was chosen by 63 percent of the patients, and that of a partner.

The image of the physician is associated to a certain degree with the
patient°s set for the forthcoming treatment. Patients expecting meticu-
iouo examination, a precise diagnostic conclusion. explanation, and
training in the ways to surnount the illness were predosinately oriented
toward the "emotionally neutral" physician. As was noted earlier. this
type of set occurred mostly among neurasthenic patients. Patients with
a set for syupathy, understanding, and support in resolving a pathogenic
situation preferred the "empathic" physician. This choice of contact

32

was usually encountered anong hysterical patients. Patients expecting

a ”magic cure” through hypnosis or new medicines needed a guide-physician.
This set reflected the patient's passive position and occurred most
frequently among patients with the hypochondriacal syndrone.

The next stage of analysis was to study the unique features of the way the
physician end patient perceiVe one another. and the influences perception
has on forsation‘of psychotherapeutic contact. The ”asctionally neutral”
variant doainated over ”empathic“ in the descriptions given by the patients
of the reel treating physicians. in contrast to the corresponding rela-
tionships seen in the standard ideas about the physician. The "directive“
variant of the physician description was indicated by the patients more
frequently than the ”nondirective“ variant. 0n the whole the patients
perceived the treating physician equally often in the role of a guide and
a partner. it should be noted that female patients described the treating
physician as “empathic" three tines more frequently then did men.
Neurasthenic patients celled their physician an "esotionally neutral, non-
directiva” partner lost frequently. hysterical patients evaluated the
treating physician as a ”directive“ guide more frequently (52 percent)
than did neurasthenic patients (30 percent). All neurotic patients
suffering obsessive states evaluated their treating physicians during
coeamnication with then as possessing certain volitional qualities.

The_dietribution of role evaluations (partner and guided) was relatively
uniform in the descriptions of the physician-patient relationships. with
guided patients dominating slightly. It should be noted that in nest
descriptions of such patients. the physicians noted traits of indecisiveness,
lack of confidence. and passiveness.

The obtained data on the specific ways physicians and patients perceive
one another and an analysis of the questionnaire and interview data made
it possible to reveal three dcuinant types of psychotherapeutic inter-
action between physician and patient in psychotherapy.

The first type of contact is psychotherapautic guidance (45 percent).

in which the physician occupied the doainant. active position and the
patient resained relatively inactive. Often endowing the physician with
“magic" qualities. the patients were especially susceptible to his
suggestive influences. It should be noted that this type of contact
reflects the traditional socionedical conception of roles in the physician-
patient died (a passive. helpless patient and a physician appearing as

a source of strength and help). Among the clinical groups, this type

of contact doainated for psychopathic patients (55 percent) as well as
neurotic patients exhibiting the asthonic syndrome (50 percent): it was
rarely encountered along neurotic patients with obsessive states (20
percent). In a number of cases. when the motivation for treatment was
weak. the set was passive, intelligenca was low. and the personality of
the patient was characterized by relative social maturity. the patient

33
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

needed guidance and auoritativu counsel, and this type of contact was
necessary and effective. Psychotherapeutic guidance coupled with an
enmthic approach permits these patients to assimilate the physician‘s
prenises better and thus develop adequate sets and forms of behavior.
Low psychotherapeutic activity or the patient. and frequently dependence
on the physician for completion of treatnent, was a shortcoming of this
type of contact.

The second type of interaction between physician and patient established
from analyzing the netsrial was psychotherapeutic partnership (38 percent),
which was typified by the physician‘s desire to develop the patient‘s
activity and his responsibility for the outcome of treat-ant tron the

very beginning. This type or contact dominated among neurotics with
obsessive states (60 percent). Its advantages lie in presence of suffi-
ciently deep contact between the physician and patient, and in the
psychotherapeutic activenese of the latter.

The third type of interaction between physician and patient is psycho-
therapeutic guidance-partnership (17 percent), in which the initial role
behavior of both individuals changed in the course of psychotherapy.

in this case the type of interaction between physician and patient usually
changed in the direction from guidance to partnership owing to the fact
that the patient became an active participant of the psychotherapeutic
process. .‘i'his type of contact was most widespread among neurasthenic
patients (24 percent). Its advantage lay in successive development of

the patient's psychotherapeutic activeness.

The therapeutic suitability of mutual relationships evolving between
physician and patient in the process of psychotherapy was evaluated with
the help or a rating scale of optimum contact developed specially on

the basis or an analysis of questionnaire and interview data.

The first characteristic of the degree to which contact was optimum was

the extent to which the patient ”accepted“ the emotional and role behavior
of the physician, with a consideration for the patient's standard of

the physician. It was established that the initial image of the “ideal“
physician often changed in response to contact with the treating physician,
both in the direction of closer agreement of the treating physician and

the image (22 percent) and in the direction of greater distance (ll percent) .
An analysis of the data demonstrated that when the physician is aware of
and accounts for the patient's physician standard, he can doubtlessly
establish closer contact. When the opposite is true, comunication does
not develop properly. Often the patient "accepted" the inconsistency
between the physician's role behavior and that expected or him, but he

was unable to ”accept“ the emotional discrepancies. A high degree of
”acceptance” of the physician's style of behavior by the patient was
observed more frequently in the presence of partnership involving ”empathic"
relationships (100 percent) than in the presence of guidance coupled with

34
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

“emotionally neutral” relationships (29 percent). a low degree of
“acceptance" was encountered more often among hysterical patients (24
percent) than among neurasthenic patients (12 percent). The reason for
this lies in the fact that most hysterical patients typically had a set
for the "empathic" type of communication, and as a rule the physician's

"emotionally neutral“ attitude elicited a negative reaction in these
patients.

The second characteristic of the degree to which contact is optimum is

the extent of the patient's ”acceptance" of the psychotherapeutic objec-
tives of the physician, which not infrequently failed to agree with the
patient's expectations from the treatment. The physician's ignorance

of certain stable therapeutic expectations of the patient or his failure
to account for them led to tension, to a struggle to confirm therapeutic
goals (as an example, one physician focused on analyzing the causes for
the inadequacy of the patient's set. and all the patient expected of the
physician was intervention into pathogenic family or production situations).
In a nutter of cases this tension is surmounted by partial acceptance,

in the initial phase of therapy by the physician. of some of the expec-
tations of the patient (for example his set for medicines, hypnosis, or
autogenio training). followed by reorientation of the patient in accordance
with the previously defined psychotherapeutic objectives. Strong expres-
sion of this characteristic was encountered most frequently with contact
of the guidance-partnership type (82 percent). Successive development

of the patient's activeness in the presence of this variant of contact
promoted successful development of compatability of the physician's
objectives and the patient's expectations. a high degree of 'acceptance"
of the physician's objectives was most pronounced among neurotics
suffering obsessive states (60 percent) and least of all among patients
with the hypochondriacal syndrome (9 percent). This can be explained by
the fact that neurotics suffering obsessive states sense the “strangeness"
of their disease especially acutely and eagerly accept the psychological
objectives of psychothera .

The third characteristic of the degree to which contact was optimum was
the extent of the patient's psychotherapeutic activeness during therapy;
his activeness varied between resistance to psychotherapy and active
cooperation. Resistance was usually manifested as the patient's displea-
sure with the physician, dissatisfaction with the therapy. negative
reactions to certain demands of the physician, and so on. An analysis of
interview data showed that the most frequent causes of this were “incom-
patability" of the patient's sets and the physician's psychotherapeutic
style of behavior, the physician's obvious disregard of the patient's
stable therapeutic expectations, premature explanation of the causes

of the neurosis, demands of frankness or activeness imposed upon the
patient too soon, the physician's latent negative emotional reaction to
the patient. and transfer of the patient to.another physician without
adequate preparation. The high and moderate degrees of patient activeness

35

FOli OPI’IOIM. USE ONLY

were found to occur wet frequently (loo percent) in the presence of
partnership and guidance-partnership containing “empathic“ relationships.
A high degree of this characteristic was more typical of neurasthenic
patients (22 percent) than hysterical patients (5 percent). anda low degree

of activeness was noted nout frequently among patients with the hypo-
chondriacal syndrome (73 percent).

When contact was evaluated by all three characteristics together. highly
optimum contact wan encountered most often in “empathic“ partnership
(86 percent) and guidance-partnership (82 percent), and much more rarely
in "emotionally neutral” guidance (7 percent); rather high and moderate
degrees of optimum were usually encountered among neurasthenic patients
and neurotics suffering obsessiVe states, while the lowest degree was
observed among hysterical patients. The nest effective types of contact
in the presence of neurasthenia were partnership and guidance-partnership.
partnership and guidance were equally effective in the presence of
hysteria. partnership was most effectiVe in the presence of neurosis

coupled with obsessive states. and guidance was the most effective in
rolat ion to psychopathies.

Data on the effectiVeness of psychotherapy reflected the physician's and
patient'u evaluation of the work done and of the results of their cooper-
ation. A specially deVuloped scale was used in the analysis of the data.
One of the principal characteristics of the effectiVeness of psychotherapy
was the score giVen to the direct results of treatment (improvement in
symptoms). a high scoreusignificant improvement (recovery)--was found to
appear most frequently with "espathic‘ partnership (57 percent), and the
lowest score-~insignificant improvement (no chdn90)--dcconpanied “emo-
tionally neutral" partnership (61 percent). The best therapeutic impact
was enjoyed by neurasthenic patients, while that of hysterical patients
and neurotics with obsessive states was relatively worse.

A number of additional criteria of the effectiveness of psychotherapy
were studied with the goal of reflecting some aspects of the psychotherapy.
These included. first, the degree to which the patient recognizes the
psychological mechanisms of his illness (a high degree of awareness was
found to be the most widespread with "empathic" partnership and, in
relation to clinical groups. asIong neurotics with obsessive states) a low
degree of awareness correlated with "emotionally neutral" guidance and
psychopathic“) second. the degree to which adequacy in relation to the
disease, to the patient's personality. and to surrounding individuals was
increased. Dominance of a high degree of expressiveness of this index

in the case of the “esapat‘nic' guidance type of contact can be explained
by the fact that it was in this form of contact that acceptance of the
physician's premises by the patient was observed most frequently. A large
increase in adequacy was usually noted among neurotic patients with
obsessive states. notional reactions of the patient (confidence.
unstable confidence, anxiety) to release from the clinic were also studied.

A sense or confidence was usually obserVed in relation to "empathic“
partnership (4: percent). while a sense of anxiety was noted usually with
“emotionally neutral" partnership (5? percent). Anxiety was noted least

The owerall evaluation of the effectiveness or psychotherapy reflected

the productivity of contact between physician and patient. "methie"
partnership (4: percent) and “empathic” guidance (41 percent) were lost

other forms or contact, in the presence of "empathic" guidance-partnership
a low degree of psychotherepeutic effectiveness was not noted in any of
the observations. This provides the grounds (or suggesting that in

Thus the treating physician's awareness and consideration of what the

of the society's lireuin production and sanagelaent, in education and
public health. in ideology and propaganda. and in science and art.

This is why the role or tho hush (actor in all or the spheres enuserated

In developed socialist society the role of these factors grows measurably
in coaparison with their role in preceding socioeconomic rotations.

The range or problems pertaining to the husan factor is estrousely broad.

Some of then are purely psychological while others require the cospetency

of social, natural. and technical sciences contiguous with psychology. But
in both cases solution of these problems would be impossible without reliance
upon the data or psychological science.

where it diecerns its most noble goal. The USSR Constitution declares:

the prerequisite of unrestrained development of all.‘ the state takes as its
goal expansion of the real possibilities citirens have for utilising their

creative strengths. capabilities. and endowments, for conprehansivs develop-
ment of the personality)".

What are the principal directions in research on the hmn factor. and which

directions define the functions of psychological science in developed
socialist society?

It was emphasised at the 25th cpsu Congress that if the economic and social
tasks facing the country are to be conplated successfully. we can follow
no path other than rapid growth of labor productivity and of the effective-
ness of all social production.

of course. before we can reveal the reserves for growth in labor productivity
we would hose to initiate research in many areas of the social, natural.

and technical sciences. Achievements in the area of production economic
planning and control systems and the progress enjoyed in development of
engineering and technology are uncovering huge reserves for increasing labor
productivity and the effectiveness of production. But these reserves

could be utilized fully only on tho condition that the individual‘s cre-
ativity is allowed to develop. 'i‘here is no need to prom: that man is the
main productive force of society. And this means that the sciences

have the most important place in revealing the reserves for growth in
labor productivity.

Research on these capabilities (in the broad sense of the word) and on the
laws and conditions of their development and implementation in labor could
hardly be possible without the active participation of psychological science.
Psychology faces a broad range of problems in this regard--from psycho-
physiological to psychosocial problems. Sensible-«hat is. scientifically
groundednorganisation of labor requires research on the way the individual's
cepabilities, needs. and the motives of his behavior develop. the way work-
ing knowledge and skills. the ability to plan one's work. proficiency. and
labor excellence are molded. on the dynamics of efficiency. on the way in-
dividual psychological features of the individual affect his labor. the way
the labor collective forms and develops. the way the psychological climate
takes shape in the shop. section. and enterprise. and much else.

We must focus special attention on coordinating technology and production
processes with hman characteristics. inasmuch as the effectiveness and

dependability with which equipment is operated depends on this to a signif-
icant extent.

it should be emphasised that at the present stage of production development.
the nature of social labor is changing fundamentally. the principal changes
are occurring in the ratio between physical and mental labor. Pull mechani-
zation and automation of production processes and the use of computers to
control them have become typical phenomena of modern production. Under
these conditions the complexity of human activity is increasing: The sig-
nificance of actions associated with the use and processing of information
and decision making is increasing: the simplest forms of operations are de-
creasing in number and undergoing modification, and physical loads are de-
creasing. Muirsmsnto on men's 'intellectual sphere," on his volitional
and emotional qualities are growing. The responsibilities of specialists
controlling automated systems are rising significantly: their errors can
on occasion lead to disaster. as should add to this that the swift growth
of the educational, cultural, and political competency of Soviet people
coupled with the standard of living they have achieved has heightened the
significance of social and psychosocial factors in their productive activities.

All of these trends have had the result that psychological factors have be-
come the most important reserve for growth in labor productivity. and that
scientific research on these factors has become a task of great state
importance.

Utilization of the reconendations offered by psychological science concern-

ing production organization can and does in fact provide a significant
technical-economic impact. He can cite many concrete examples in this

marks. x" and Engel‘s. 7., “Soch.” (works), Vol 23. p 178

regard. but of course the technical-economic impact enjoyed from intro-
ducing the reccsmendetions of psychology into production is not all that

is inportsnt. What is even more important is that psychologically grounded
improvmnt of work processes is promoting development of man's capabilities
and maintenance of his efficiency. Such improvement is also an isportant

prerequisite for transforming labor into the primal vital need of the
individual.

of course psychological research on human labor is also being conducted in
capitalist countries with the goal increasing labor productivity (in this
case the research is often nore effective than in our country in relation
to some production operations). In the end. however. the results of this
research are utilised in behalf of capital. In the Heat. psychology is
often the means for exploiting laborers even more. .
in our country. where exploitation of one can by another has been abolished.
psychology serves the interests of the people of labor. The results of

applying its reconendations to production benefit all society and every
Soviet citiren.

Psychological research has no less significance to the matter of isproving
national economic control systems. after all. control mans. first of all.
management of people. if it is to be organised on a scientific basis. we
must gain an understanding of the laws governing human behavior and devel-
opment of the personality‘s psychological makeup, of the individual psycho-
logical differences between people. of the processes of cc-unication be-
tween them. of foraation of interpersonal relationships typical of socialism.
and so on. Understatemsnt of the psychological aspects of particular con-
trol problass can lead (and does in fact lead) to the arisal of various
“psychological barriers.“ On the other hand wherever these aspects are
considered. they become a powerful factor. promoting an increase in the
effectiveness of control.

The range of psychological problems associated with the task of improving
the national economic control system is also extremely broad. Solution of
these problems is requiring the united effort of psychologists special-
ising in different areas. It would be important to eaphasise that in
developed socialist society. the broadest masses of laborers are encouraged
to participate in oanagesent. This means that the role of psychological
problems associated with mist indoctrination of Soviet people is
growing.

The 25th CPSU Congress has defined the task of molding the new can as one

of the most important in the present stage of conunist construction. Its
completion requires initiation of research in a nuber of sciences. Psy-
chology. which must reveal the mechanisms behind the way the socialist
social relationships are reflected in concrete people and behind the way the
traits of their personalities are molded. has a major role among than. after
all, it would be incorrect to believe that new social relationships would,

so to speak. autonatically produce a new can. This is a complex process.

and our ability to control it will depend on what we learn about the laws
governing development of the personality. social relationships are not
something existing outside of concrete individuals. Every person is in-
cluded within these relationships. directly by his activity and through
his cosmunication with other people. He is both the subject and carrier
of these relationships.

As he develops in society, the individual assimilates the evolved system of
norms. principles. and rules of behavior. Most important in this regard
are the psychological mechanisms behind the social regulation of behavior.

The issue of the new (more accurately, ”modernized') man. who is contrasted
with the ”traditional" man in terms of his psychological characteristics.

is being raised inbourgeois psychology. Painting the portrait of “modernized“
man. researchers point to unification of psychological makeup, to standardi-
ration as one of the principal characteristics. it is asserted that the
relationships "modernized" man has with other people are structured in
accordance with the principle behind man-machine relationships. In this

case attempts are being made to deduce this portrait directly from the
specific features of the scientific-technical revolution examined without
regard to the social system in which they exist.

In its research on molding of the new man, Soviet psychology bases itself
on an analysis of social relationships. They (and not development of pro-
duction and equipment itself) are precisely what predetermine the properties
of the new man. In opposition to the conception of the ”modernized' man:
Soviet psychology is working on the theory of comprehensive development of
the entire personality of the individual in socialist society. Organic
unification of the achievements of the scientific-technical revolution with
the advantages of socialism isnot-‘leading to unification and standardization
of people: on the contrary it is creating the possibilities for all-out
development of every individual, of the individuality of every person.

it would be important to note that the ideological function of psychology

is growing today. The question as to what man is, what the 'mainsprings"
of his behavior are. is not of purely academic interest alone. The problem
of man is now becoming the field of the most acute ideological struggle.

It is well known that the ruling circles of the western countries are trying
to capitalize upon some psychological conceptions to prove the stability of
the capitalist structure (supposedly its stability goes hand in hand with
the very nature of man), for the purposes of racial discrimination (as if
nature itself has differentiated the races into superior and inferior) , to
fight the movement of national liberation (by their psychological makeup
some nations are capable of self-government while others are not) , and so on.

Take as an example conceptions asserting presence of genetic limitations

upon the mental development of certain categories of people--classes,
nationalities, and races. The practice of socialist and columnist construction
in countries of the world socialist system has demonstrated in fact that

43
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

the real limitations are created by class and other barriers, and not
by human genetics. The socialist system has broken these barriers down,
opening a broad highway for development of every individual.

Inplenentation of the principles of social equality and internationalisn
has demonstrated the groundlessness of conceptions asserting that talent

is the property of the elite, which is supposedly placed above the masses
by nature itself.

The practice of revolutionary transformation has also refuted the Freudian
thesis of prineval antagonism between the personality and the society, as
well as the assertion made by sons psychologists that egoisn is a natural

property of man, the product of the biological principle of the struggle
for existence.

The experience of building a new society in our country and in other
socialist countries has confirmed Marx' premise that only within the col-
lective can the individual acquire the resources affording him the possibil-
ity for comprehensive development of his inherited capabilities and,
consequently, that it is only within the collective that personal freedom
is possible. Development of the instinct of collectivisn in the mutual
relationships of people has dsaonstrated that egoisn is a social and not

a biological phenoesnon.

The results of psychological research are being used by capitalist ideolo-
gists to develop the I'technology" of influencing the consciousness, the
"technique of imprinting the brain“ with ideas favoring the capitalist way
of life as supposedly being the human ideal--that is, psychology is being

used as a means of ideological brainwashing of people in the interests of
capitalism.

Under these conditions further work on psychological theory based on the
Marxist-Deninist doctrine of man is acquiring extremely great significance
in the struggle for the ideals of socialism. Only a consistently scientific
theory revealing the essence of ran as representing the entire systen of
social relationships can oppose the pressure of Freudian and nee-Freudian,
behavioristic and neobehavioristic, biologizational, positivistic, and other
conceptions widely encountered in the West.

The achievements of Soviet psychology can and must be utilized in the
interests of asserting the socialist way of life, in the interests of
socialism's ideology.

'rhus psychology is directly involved in the problems of couunist construc-
tion. Utilization of its achievements in social practice is becoming the

most important prerequisite for growth in labor productivity and quality,
greater effectiveness of production and control, development of modern
technology and production processes, improvement of socialist social relation-
ships, and the molding of the new man. here lie the basic functions of

psychological science in deVeloped socialist society. Performing these
functions. psychology is consistently following the principles of true
humanitarianism and social optimism.

In connection with constantly increasing differentiation (there are several
dozen independent areas and directions in modern psycholOgy). the philo-
sophical, methodological. and general theoretical problems of psychology
are acquiring exceptionally great significance in the present stage of our
scionce's deVelopment. Only intense work on the general theory of psy-
chology will insure careful selection and systematisetion of scientific
data. ideas. approaches. methods. and conceptions being accumulated in
every specialized area and. consequently. development of psychological
knowledge as a whole. Fundamental research is precisely what is defining
the prospects for the development of our science. At the same time develop-
ment of the general theory of psychology is a prerequisite for effective
utilization of its achievements in social practice.

Developing on the basis of Marxism-uninism. Soviet psychology has always
devoted and continues to devote a good deal of attention to general theo-
retical problems. Its methodological praises. which were defined about
half a century ago. are enjoying constant development. improvement. and
enrichment.

work on the principles of determinism, development. reflection. the unity
of activity and consciousness. and the personality approach in application
to the entire complex of psychological problems has produced the main
achievements of Soviet psychology.

In addition to general psychology. fundamental research in its special
areas has great significance to the development of psychological science--
social. medical. child and pedagogical. engineering psychology. labor
psychology. neuropsychology. general and differential psychophysiology.
psycholinguistics. sports psychology. management psychology. and other
areas. It should be noted in this regard that some of the directions of
psychology (engineering. organisational, space psychology. and so on) have
been brought into being by the scientific-technical revolution.

Each of the enumerated areas of psychology deals with certain facets of
mental phenomena. provides knowledge about their associations and relation-
ships. and helps us to penetrate more deeply into their nature. At the
same time development of the special areas of psychological science is
creating a broad foundation for development of its fundamental problems and
its general theory. While a quarter of a century ago general psychology
was “nourished" by concrete data accumlated mainly in child and pedagogical
psychology. today the range of these data is expanding significantly and
growing richer. This. by the way, is very important to theoretical general-
izations. and to their control and correction.

Theoretical generalizations in psychology now require increasingly deeper
analysis and comparison of data accumulated in different areas. But these

45
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

data are often found to be contradictory. and they often fail to fit into
the ‘procrustean bed“ of the general scheses and conceptions to which we
haVe bucone accustomed. Unfortunately we clearly devote insufficient
attention to systematizing data being acoumlated in different areas of
psychological science.

Development of a general theory of psychology which would be structured
on the basis of the achievements of the entire system of psychological
sciences is urgently requiring work on concrete scientific principles and
methods of systems analysis, which rests upon the presises of dialectic
materialism end which is continued by the entire course of the developaent
of modern science.

The idea of the systems approach is now attracting more and lore attention
from psychologists. There have already been some achievements in this
area. work on a systems theory of psychology is the main theoretical task
of the newly created USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of Psychology.

The "theoretical edifice” is itself a complex structure. It would be in-
correct to interpret the entire problen as if general theory is a set of
general ideas and principles located in a single plane. In Iodern psychol-
09!. theory falls into different levels. Some of thee pertain to the nest
general laws and properties of psychology. others are related to special
areas of human activity. a third group deal with particular problus, and

so on. we can obviously consider nacro-, new. and nicrolevele of

analysis of aenral phenomena and. correspondingly, different levels of
theoretical generalizations. The relationship between different levels

is rarely obvious. Sonatina in psychological research we encounter
attempts at excessive expansion or. on the other hand.unjustified con-
striction (this occurs such more rarely) of the spheres of application of
particular generalizations. conceptions. and hypotheses, and we occasionally
come across inaccurate eveluations of the level of description. of 'neterial-
nation" of psychological knowledge. This creates theoretical confusion.
and practical utilizaiton of the results of such a theory can lead to
serious errors.

The present stage of development of psychology urgently denands analysis of
the 'architectonics” of its theoretical edifice, revelation of these “blocks“
and "stories'' which have already been created, of those which are presently
only on the drawing boards, and of those which must still be planned and
created.

he i noted earlier, within the systsn of modern scientific knowledge psy-
chology is beginning to play an increasingly more noticeable role. The
specific place of psychology within the system of science--it is the do.-
inant science in research on mam-opens up broad perspectives for its
development. Comrade L. l. Brezhnev said: mthe new possibilities for fruit-
ful research of both general theoretical. fundamental. and applied

nature are being opened up at the juncture of different sciences. particularly

(06

the MN!“ and social sciences. These possibilities nust be utilised to
the fullest extent.“ This pertains to psychology perhaps sore than to
any other science. We can be sure that utilisation of the possibilities

being opened up by the specific place of psychology will insure its inten-
eive developsent.

Modern psychology is a highly differentiated systee of scientific disciplines
and directions. Sons of then (for example child and pedagogical psychology)
already have long-established traditions: their object and problems have
been clearly defined. and the research methods have been worked out. Others
are in a developmental stage (social psychology for example). A third group
are just beginning their develop-est (for example forensic, organisational.
and space psychology). A fourth group are enjoying ainost no development
at all (for example the frontiers of psychology and genetics. psychology
and biocheoistry. and psychology and economics). Once our country had con-
ducted a great deal or research in soopaychology and coeparatiVe psychology.
Unfortunately this research has been scrapped.

Thus there are obvious disproportions in the development of different areas
of psychological science. in the next few years we will have to begin work
on those areas of psychology which are still in an embryonic state. inas-
much as these areas are for the most part on the frontiers of other sciences.
their developoent will require the closest possible cooperation with contig-
uous sciences.

Certain disproportions can also exist in the analysis of the probless of
general psychology. while in regard to probleu pertaining to so-called
cognitive processes we are working on a broad front and many valuable achieVe-
nents have been attained. research on the processes of lental regulation

of behavior and activity is still clearly insufficient. Very little re-
search is being doneon attention. auction. will, and character. Not enough
emphasis is being placed on ideas and imagination. And yet within the over-
all systee of psychological knowledge these problem have extremely great
significance. We must apparently redistribute our efforts; He met plan
our work in such a way as to insure snore or less her-onious develop-ent of
the entire systen of the basic problem of general psychology.

Jointly with the 088R Madcay of sciences institute of Psychdogy. the USSR
Acedeay of Pedagogical Sciences. and the country‘s leading universities the
USSR Society of Psychologists has undertaken an effort to write a plan for
develops-ant of psychology in our country. This work sust be continued. we
must costs up with a long-range plan which would insure a rise in the effect-
iveness and quality of psychological research.

The tine has cone to seriously analyze the trends in developsent of the
problem thuaelves with which psychology is concerned. to reveal the

logical relationships among these problems, to determine those areas of

problems which require concentrated effort, and to organise work on them
appropriately.

Purther work on the conceptual machinery of psychological theory, especially
on those categories reflecting the most general and significant properties
of phenomena being studied by psychology. has the most important significance
to development of psychological theory.

The activity category is enjoying the most intense research in our country.

Application of the Marxist teaching on human activity has played and con-
tinues to play an important role in development of both general psychology
and its specialized areas. But we should note that the concept itself of
"activity” is now being used so broadly that its meaning is becoming fuzzy,
and its power of explanation is waning correspondingly. Frequently one
meaning of this concept is substituted by another, creating confusion.
within the system of Marxist-uninist theory, activity is interpreted as

a sociohistoric category , and as such it is the object of a number of
sciencesuphilosophy and sociology, economics and law, and history and
pedagogics. We should note that psychological research on activity has
stimulated research on it in other sciences to some extent. But the
aspect of activity which can be studied by no science other than psychology
is not always clearly defined by psychology itself.

In concrete psychological investigations, activity has been traditionally
studied and is studied today as the activity of an individual, as individual
activity. And yet in real life the activity of the individual is associated
one way or another with the activity of other people. Thus arises the

task of conducting psychological research on different forms of joint
activity. Work in this direction is already beginning in social psychology,
but other areas of psychological science are no less interested in this area.
Apparently joint activity of people must be studied by integrated effort.

often when we deal with categories such as consciousness, cognition, person-
ality, conunication, social relationships, and so on, the psychological
aspects of the research are often substituted by philosophical, sociological,
pedagogical, and ethical aspects, and vice verse. The need has arisen for
examining these categories as a system and for clearly determining those
aspects which must be studied by psych0109y, and by psychology alone. Under-
standably, this would require joint creative work on the part of representa-
tives of other sciences, chiefly philosophers.

we also need further deep theoretical research on the principles of psychol-
ogy. The fundamental principles of Soviet psychology are well known, and
there is no need to repeat them here. at the moment it would be important
to note that the relationships between these principles are not sufficiently
clear as yet. Some principles are extraaely general, pertaining essentially
to all sciences (for example the principle of determinism), while others

embrace several associated sciences, and still others are specific to
psychology. To put it more briefly, the principles are not of equal ranks.
We have yet to reveal their associations and relationships and formulate the
system of principles precisely as a system.

One of the most important prerequisites for development of psychological
theory is active participation in social practice. In psychological society
we can still encounter the absurd and harmful opinion that practical work

is menial, that practical work is for those who lack the talent for

greater things. It would be pertinent to recall the words of B. H. Teplov,

a psychologist and an active member of the RSPSR Academy of Pedagogical
Sciences, who wrote the following in his brilliant article "The Mind of A
Troop Contender": “here we to establish degrees of difficulty and of the
complexity of the reguirasents these difficulties impose on the mind, we
would have to recognise that from the point of view of diversity and. some-
times, the internal contradiction of intellectual tasks as well as the
rigidity of the conditions within which mental work must proceed, the highest
forms of practical activity would have to be placed at the top of our scale."

He must mold a correct attitude (especially among the young) toward the
relationship between theory and practice in the development of science.
Only an organic unification of theory, experimentation, and practice can
insure a rise in the effectiveness and quality of psychological research.

Discussing introduction of the achievements of psychology into practice.

it would be important to note that the ways these achievements are intro-
duced can be different. In some cases introduction can be direct, while

in others achievements can be introduced through pedagogics, medicine,
engineering developments, and so on. Their introduction demands integrated
research relying upon systems theory.

It is becoming vitally necessary to train specialists capable of working

on practical scientific tasks--pedagogical psychologists, medical psycholo-
gists, and engineering psychologists. In the next few years we must
develop programs for training such specialists and clearly determine their
functions, the range of their tasks, and the principles and methods of their
completion. of course this would require serious improvement of the

entire system of psychologist training. Persons who receive a psychological
education must not only know a great deal, but they must also know how to
do a great deal. They must have a facility with modern theory and methods
of scientific research and practical scientific work-methods which they
could utilize not only in scientific research institutions but also in
production, in the design office, in the clinic, in the school, and so on.
