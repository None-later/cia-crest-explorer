Chemicals used to protect plants from pests. diseases and weeds and chemicals used

to protect animals from ectoparaaites have acquired very great significance in agri-
culture and associated areas. The scale of their production and application is con-
stantly growing, and the volume of scientific research being carried out in this area.
so important t': the national eoonony. is increasing. Suffice it to say that more
than 10,000 scientific communications and patents associated with pesticide research
_are published each year. This is fully understandable. since the various chemicals
used in agriculture are capable of preserving at least a third of the total yield,
and of reducing the labor of caring for the crops.

Pesticides are being studied by scientists with the most diverse specialties, to
include chemists (synthetic chemists, process engineers. analytical chemists. physical
chenists). biochenists, entomologists, plant and animal physiologists, phytopatho-
logists. veterinarians, toxicologists, agronomists, physicians, agricultural machinery
specialists and many others. Despite the fact that the requirements on modern

preparations are continually growing, new pesticides are appearing each year. 'meir
nunher has already exceeded 1,000. and the nuber of forms of their use in different

countries now totals more than l00,000. In this connection generalization of the
accumlated material is highly significant to persons of the most diverse specialties.
Systematic presentation of this is especially isportant to students and graduate
students specializing in biologically active coupounds, as well as to specialists
entering research in this area for the first time.

The author has attempted to generalize and describe. in the shortest possible way,

the principal classes of cospounds and particular substances used and studied as
pesticides. In contrast to other handbooks on this problem, the contents of the

book are arrangeant in relation to applications but in relation to different classes
of chemical compounds, which can produce a fuller impression of the pesticidal activity
of particular classes of compounds.- This approach received a favorable evaluation
from the scientific public as is evident from translation and publication of the
author's book ”Rhiniya pestitsidov" [Pesticide atomistryl in English.

'-‘o prepare this book, the author made use of the vast monographic and patent
.lterature. The book includes sons information on production processes associated
with pesticides and intermediate products used in their production, this material

coming mainly ﬁrm patent and periodical literature. The author believes that
production flowcharts presented here would satisfy the qualified engineer: if
necessary, information of greater detail may be found in the cited original works.

This was all the more desirable because detailed description of certain processes
would have unjustifiably increased the book's volume or made it necessary to abbre-
viate other sections.

Being a researcher more interested in sore problems and less in others, the author
was unable to avoid certian nonuniformities in presentation or the material, something
that was inevitable in most cases. he author attenpted to describe the most im-
portant preparations to the fullest extent possible, but. because of the book's
limited volume the properties of many drugs are sumarized in tables, without a
complete description. '

The author hopes that the book will help readers acquaint themselves with the latest
advances in pesticides, and that it will promote their more correct use in agricul-
ture and other areas.

Because certain mistakes may have been made in this book, all notices of omissions
and errors will be received wj th deep gratefulness.

I wish to express my sincere gratefulness to Candidate or chemical Sciences
I. L. Vladimirova tor her great help in drawing up the manuscript. I also wish to
express sincere gratefulness to Dr Henry Martin for providing some of the materials.

Mon than 500 different species of animals were known in ancient Greece, about 2,000
years ago. May the umber of known species of animals and microorganisms exceeds

2 million. The Soviet entomologist N. N. Bogdanov-Kot'kov estimates that there are
more than 68,000 different insects that can do harm to man, domesticated animals,

plants and various materials. {he number of various harmful microorganisms and plants
is no.1ess. It has been established with some precision that pests and diseases rob
agriculture of not less-than a third of its yield, and significantly more when they

are not subjected to systematic control. 'l‘hus for example in the absence of systematic
control of the diseases and pests of agricultural crops, in the best case we would be
able to harvest not more than 37 percent of the normal yield of potatoes, not more

than 22 percent of the yield of cabbage, 10 percent of the apple yield, 9 percent of
the peach yield and so on.

here are many examples in world practice of massive annihilation of various crops
by plant diseases and pests. Owing to massive infection of potatoes by phytophthora
in Ireland in 1845-1851, a large part of the yield perished. resulting in'the starva-
tion and death of about a million persons. In 1930 up to 30 percent of the (SA's
wheat harvest perished due to stem rust. and in 1954 about 3 million tons of wheat

in western Canada were killed by stem rust (l). - '

Plant pests and pathogens have representatives among various living organisms, to
include insects, ticks, mollusks. nematodes (round worms), fungi, bacteria, viruses.
parasitic plants and so on. A large humor of phytopathogenic microorganisms and
insects infect potatoes, corn, grains, legumes, fruits. vegetables. cotton and flax.
Monte are responsible for enormous losses in agriculture. One gray rat and its
progeny can destroy foodstuffs worth a total of not less than 400 rubles in the course
of 1 year. '

Data on worldwide losses of various agricultural crops to posts, plant diseases and
weeds are shown below (2,3):'

Insect pests and microorganisms do significant harm, destroying wood, paper, articles
made from cotton, wool and silk, natural and synthetic rubber, plastic, leather, and
so on. Nonutallic materials undergo especially rapid destruction in a moist, warm
climate. Thus in the tropics cotton and wool textiles and wood break down in l or 2
months. Even optical glass can undergo spoilage in the tropics (4).

Harmful insects: pests and other parasites are also a great danger to animal husbandry,
since many of them are not only infectious disease vectors, but they also damage the
animal's hide and serve as an irritant to the animal, reducing the milk yield and

weight gain. Losses caused by just a single parasite in the USSR, the cattle fly.
are estimated at 500 million rubles per year.

It would be difficult to overstate the harm done to human health by various insect
pests and ticks, which carry infectious diseases, especially if we recall that not so
long ago more. than 100 million persons on the globe were infected by malaria, and in
some regions of our planet this disease is still taking millions of lives each year.
Encephalitis, typhus, recurrent fever, sleeping sickness, elephantiasis and many other
diseases carried-by various insects and arachnids offer a serious hazard to man (5).
This hazard is aggravated by the swiftness with which insects reproduce. thus a
housefly, which can undergo seven generations in a season, may produce a progeny of
3.5101 individuals, while the apple aphid, with a reproductive capacity of 20 genero
ations per season. can produce 3520 individuals. It is only the high mortality of
these insects that keeps them from accumlating in nature to their maximum potential

(6).

Losses suffered by agriculture due to weeds are no less great. They remove moisture
and nutrients from soil and crops, they shade crops and hinder their normal growth,
they contaminate harvested grain with seeds poisonous to man and animals and so on.
In some cases a harvest may be lost entirely. In the course of a single season,

a kilogram of weeds (corrected for dry matter) consume from 250 to 1,000 liters of

water. Withdrawal of nutrients from soil is shown in Table 1, given average infesta-
tion of crops by weeds (130-150 plants per square meter) (7,8).

Given a worldwide yield totaling about $140 billion per year, losses due to pests,
diseases and weeds are estimated at $75 billion per year (2).

the chemical method is one of the most convenient for controlling harmful organisms.
Chemicals used to annihilate certain species of harmful organisms are called pesti-

. cides.

Pesticides are divided into the following basic groups depending on the targets of
their application.

Acaricides—to control ticks.

algicidesnto kill algae and other aquatic vegetation.

Antisepticento protect nonmetallic materials from destruction by nitroorganisns.
ArboricidoSnto kill undesirable woody plants and shrubs.

Bactericides--to control bacteria and bacterial diseases of plants.
Herbicidesuto control weeds.

Zoocides--to control rodents. This group is often referred to as rodenticides in
the foreign literature.

Insecticides--to control. insect pests. Certain groups of insecticides have been
given more specific names; for exanple aphicides are preparations used to control
aphids.

Limacides or nolluscosidesnto control various mollusks, including gastropods.
Nematocidese-to control round worm (nematodes).

Pungicidesnto control plant diseases and various fungi.

Also categorised as pesticides are chemical plant growth stinulators and inhibitors,
leaf removing preparations (defoliants) and plant drying preparations (dessicants)
used to permit mechanization of the laborious operations of harvesting cotton, soy,

potatoes and many other crops, and preparations that repel (repellents) . attract
(attractants) and sterilize insects (sexual sterilizers).

Herbicides, insecticides and fungicides have found the widest use in agriculture and
other sectors.

Insecticides are divided into the following basic subgroups depending on the way they
penetrate into the organism: contact insecticides, which kill insects on contacting
any part of the body; intestinal insecticides which penetrate into the insect body
through feeding organs and which kill it as a result of entry of poison into the
intestine: systemic insecticides, which are capable of moving through the plant vascu-
lar system and poisoning insects using such plants as food; fmigants, which penetrate
into the insect body through respiratory organs. It should be noted that most of

the drugs used today may penetrate into the insect body by different pathways. In
this connection certain drugs are placed in particular subgroups on the basis of the
principal pathway of their penetration into the insect body. Thus for example,
lindane has contact, intestinal and fumigant action, but it is usually classified

as a contact drug.

Some insecticides block up the insect's respiratory tract, causing the insect to die
by asphyxiation. Such preparations include mineral oils, silica gels (in finely dis-
persed state) and some others.

Fungicides are usually divided into two basic subgroups: Fungicides used to control
diseases of vegetating plants, and seed disinfectants, which are used on seeds prior
to planting to protect sprouts from various diseases. In turn, fungicides used on

green plants are divided into drugs having preventive action, used to protect plants
from various infections, and preparations having exterminant (therapeutic) action,

used to treat plants. As with the insecticides,- the fungicides include drugs having
contact and systemic action, though the latter group of substances is extremely small

in number. Antiseptics used on mnmetallic materials and bactericides are often
classified as fungicides. In many cases the same substances used for plant protection

are also used as antiseptics and bactericides. It should be noted that many fungicides
have weak bactericidal activity (9-12).

Herbicides are divided into two basic subgroups depending on the nature of their action
upon the plant: general, acting upon all species of plants, and selective, dangerous
only to certain plant species and safe in relation to other plants. This division is
arbitrary because depending on the concentrations used and the consumption rate per

unit of treated area, the same substances may act as both general and selective
herbicides (13).

All herbicides are divided into three subgroups depending on the outward signs of their
action upon plants and the application methods: contact herbicides, systemic herbi-
cides and herbicides acting upon the root system of plants or germinating seeds.

Contact herbicides include substances which injure plant leaves and stems when the
latter come in direct contact with the drug. This disturbs the plant's normal vital
activities, and it dies. It should be considered, however, that such herbicides
affect only those portions of the plant upon which the preparation settles; moreover
in some cases we observe growth of new shoots and further development of an injured

plant. The reason for this is that substances within this group are incapable of
moving through the plant's vascular system.

Systenic herbicides include substances capable of moving through the vascular system
of plants. Such herbicides, on casing in contact with plant leaves and roots, spread
quickly throughout the entire plant, causing it to die. Systemic preparations are

especially valuable in the control of weeds with large root system and perennial
needs.

The third subgroup consists of herbicides introduced into soil to destroy the seeds,
germinating seeds and roots of weeds.

Defoliants and dessicants are close in the nature of their action to contact herbi-

cides; in many cases contact herbicides are used as defoliants and dessicants, if
they are safe to the seeds of the crop being processed.

In most cases arboricides and algicides are classified as herbicides as well.

Plant growth regulators also enjoy some use both to stimulate the growth and raise
the yield of various crops and to inhibit sprouting of various roots and tubers stored

for a long period of time.

Economic Effectiveness of Pesticide Use

As was noted earlier, the losses suffered by the national ecmony due to various

pests are very high, and pesticide use can sharply reduce the harm done. Outlays- in
agriculture on pesticides within a single season (including outlays on their applica-
tion) are compensated several times over. The effectiveness of pesticides in'relation
to different crops is especially evident from a cosparison of the data shown in Table 2.

The effectiveness with which pesticides are used for public health needs can be
judged from this example (14): Before modern insecticides came into use in Ceylon,
more than 2 million cases of malaria were recorded each year; by 1964, owing to
systematic use of DDT to control malaria mosquitoes, the number of illnesses de-

creased to 13, while after the use of DDT was halted in 1968, more than 1 million
persons fell ill.

The high economic effectiveness of pesticides in agriculture and other sectors is
promoting rapid development of this sector of chemical industry, in which case we
observe not only growth in production of certain forms of pesticides but also con-
stant change and improvement of their assortment. Table 3 shows the figures for

production and sales of new organic pesticides in the USA from 1947 to 1969.

It is suggested (16,17) that further growth of pesticide production in the USA will
have the following proportions:

In 1969 the cost of.pesticides was 34 percent of the cost of fertilizers in the FPS,
and it was about 40 percent in Japan.
World pesticide production was estimated in 1972 at 11 billion West German marks

(18,19). It is believed that by 1975 it will reach 16 billion West German marks,
and 24 billion marks by 1980 (18).

In the USSR, pesticide production totaled 103,200 tons in 1965, 163,800 tons in 1970

and 173,000 tons in 1972. It is to be raised in 1975 to 256,600 tons (corrected for
the active ingredient) (20).

The world assortment of pesticides now mmbers lore than 100,000 names made from
more than 900 chemicals belonging to the most diverse classes of organic and inorganic

In the last 5 years production of chemical plant protection and weed control re-
sources in the Soviet Union grew by more than three times, and it will be raised to
455,000 tone per year by the end of the current five-year plan in compliance with a
decision of the July 1970 Plenun of the CPSU Central Cosmittee (20); The assortmmt
of drugs will increase significantly as well.

General ksquiresunts on Pesticides

A large number of different chemical coupounds exhibiting high physiological activity
in relation to many harmful organisms are known. If pesticides are to be used
successfully in agriculture, industry and public health, in additiontto high biocidal

action against various pests, the preparations must be reasonably safe to man, domes-
ticated animals and useful plants, insects and microorganisms. -

The quantities of pesticide residues on plants must not present a hazard to animals
and man. This is so ilportant that many of the world's countries have set norms for
the concentration of pesticides in various foodstuffs used by man and domesticated
animals. Special laboratories have been created in the Soviet mien to monitor the
quality of agricultural products and their pesticide concentrations, as well as possi-
ble accunilation of pesticides in the environment (in soil, water and so on). In sass
countries the quantities of pesticide residues in foodstuffs are not regulated, but
legislation establishes the minimum time prior to harvesting that plants can be treated
with pesticides, and the expenditure norms for preparations used to treat plants.

The plant treatment schedule is established in such a way that by harvest time, any
preparations used would be ooapletely or almost completely broken down (21,22). Dis-
cussing the dangers of pesticides to man and animals, we should also note, as a manda-
tory condition, absence of blastomogenic action (23,24).

There are different methods for estimating the toxicity of chemicals to manuals. In

the can and PRO, for example, all drugs that are acutely toxic to animals are divided
into three groups (where the L050. refers not to the active ingredient but to the
finished preparation) (25):

l. Preparations with an L050 up to loo mg/kg.
2. Preparations with an.l.Dso of 100-300 mg/kg.
3. Preparations with an 1.050 above 300 mg/kg.

me first group of pesticides includes strong-acting substances released to users
by special permission; the second group contains substances of average toxicity:

Wthird group are mildly toxic.
'LDsouaverage dose of a preparation, mg per kg live weight, causing 50 percent

mortality of experimental animals.

. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

In the USSR, strongly acting preparations are those with an L050 up to 50 mg/kg; highly
toxic substances have an L050 of 50-200 mg/kg, substances with moderate toxicity have
an L050 of ZOO-1,000 mg/kg, and mildly toxic preparations have an'LDso above 1,000 mg/kg.

It should be noted, however, that this division is to a certain extent arbitrary,
since the toxicity of pesticides to man and animals depends not only on the absolute
value of the preparation's lethal doses but also on a number of other conditions.
When determining the toxicity of a preparation, we must keep in mind its chronic
toxicity, the possibility of its accumulation in the hman and animal body, the re-
versibility and irreversibility of toxic effects, the pathways by which it enters

the organism and a number of other factors. We should also consider the toxicity of
compounds produced when a preparation is metabolized" in plant and animals cells.

The last property is important also because the metabolic products of some pesticides
are more toxic than the initial compounds. In this connection to correctly determine
the possible danger of a pesticide, we would need to not only determine- its L050 but
also study its metabolism.

Before determining what sensible use of a pesticide would be, it would be very im-
portant for us to first evaluate the possible pathways by which it can penetrate into
the human body. Substances in the first group, which have the capacity to penetrate
through human skin (resorption) and through the respiratory tract, are especially
hazardous. In this connection when we study the toxicity of preparations on experi-
mental animals, we determine the L050 not only when the preparation is introduced by
way of the mouth but also when it is applied to the skin, when its vapors are inhaled,
and when it enters the body by other means.

be correctly determine the danger of a certain preparation to hunan health, we must
study the mechanism of its action and establish the basic ways in which the prepara-
tion interacts with the most imrtant enzymatic systems of man and animals. Such
data also have great significance to creating preparations with selective toxicity--
that is, ones that are toxic to some species of organisms and safe to others.

One of the mst-isportant problems associated with pesticide use in agriculture is
that of possible remote consequences resulting from systematic intake with food by
man and animals in residual quantities (26-29). In this connection the quantities
of pesticide residues in foodstuffs of plant and animal origin are subjected to
standardization (28,29). Most countries have set extremely low norms for pesticide

concentration--close to zero (within the sensitivity limits of modern analytical
methods)~-for many products which enjoy the greatest demand and which appear in
man's daily ration (flour, meat, milk, butter and so on) (30), while for seasonally
consumed products (fruits, vegetables. berries and so on) the norms are slightly
higher.

The norms for the quantities of pesticide residues adopted by the USSR, USA and no
for the second group of products named above are presented below:

For this reason production of persistent drugs has recently been declining while
production of drugs with low persistence, ones which decompose oospletely within
the course of a single season and which do not remain in the yield, is rising.

Pesticides used to protect plants from pests must be completely safe to plants, while

preparations used against animal parasites must be safe to animals. Moreover pesti-
cides must not worsen the yield quality.

The time a given preparation remains within the environment is usually called its
persistence. The persistence of a preparation depends both on the physical and

on the chemical properties of substances (volatility, resistance to hydrolysis, re-
sistance to the action of soil microorganism, to oxidation by atmospheric oxygen
and to the action of sunlight, and so on).

Among the physical properties of pesticides, volatility is the most significant:

The lower the volatility, the longer a pesticide may persist in the environment.

he a certain approximation, volatility characterises the evaporativity of a substance
at a given temperature. which may be calculated by the formula:

v- as”.

where V--vclatility (evaporativity) of the substance at a given temerature, gin/n3;

Mumolecular weight: pan-pressure of saturated steam at this temperature, nu Kg;
Ely-volume of a gram-molecule at the same temperature, liters.

The size of V characterizes the volatility of the substance in a motionless atmos--
phere. It is rather difficult to calculate volatility in dynamic conditions. since
not only the temperature and rate of movement of air but also the heat capacity of
the substance and of all materials coming in contact with it, the surface form of the
preparation and so on must be taken into account. Por practical purposes most prepar-
ations are sprayed as solutions, emulsions or suspensions. Preparations are used not

in their pure form but in a complex mixture, and therefore there are certain diffi-
culties in calculating the evaporativity of their droplets.

Evaporation of the droplets of a pure substance in a motionless atmosphere has been
studied relatively well, and it may be calculated by unwuir's formula:

Using this equation we can derive a formula by which to calculate the time of cm-
plete evaporation of a droplet of the substance, k (sec):

k = __DRT
2431p,"

 

,1

where d--the substance's density, gm/cm3.

It should be noted that the rate of evaporation of droplets in moving air is con-
siderably greater.

D'Ltrerent persistence requirements are inposed on a preparation depending on its
purpose. However, in all cases decomposition of the preparation on plants by harvest
time is mandatory. The persistence of preparations introduced into soil must be the
highest possible, but it should not exceed one season for herbicides and two seasons
for drugs used to control pests inhabiting the soil. In this case the preparation
must not be absorbed by plants and accumulated in fruits or other plant parts used ,
by man or domesticated animals as food. If plants are treated not long be£ore harvest
time, such preparations must be distinguished by low persistence, and they must
decompose completely prior to harvest time.

Pesticides are usually divided into the following six groups depending on the rate
of their decomposition in soil (31):

1. Pesticides with a decomposition period longer than 18 months (organochloride
insecticides, compounds containing arsenic and selenium).

2. Pesticides with a decomposition period of about 18 montns (some triazine
herbicides, piloram, some arylurea derivatives).

3.. Pesticideswith a decomposition period or about 12 months (benzoic acid
halidederivatives. and some acid amides).

4. Pesticideswith a decomposition period of up to 6 months (acid nitriles,

some aryloxyalkane carboxylic acid derivatives, treflan and its analogues,

etc.).

5. Pesticides with a decomposition period up to 3 months (arvlcarbamic acid
derivatives).

6. Pesticides with a decomposition period less than 3 months (organophosphorus
pesticides).

The rates of decomposition of some organophosphorus insecticides in sell are shown in
Table 4 (15).

He can see from these data that even a persistent organophosphorus insecticide such
as dursban undergoes 82 percent decomposition in soil within a month, owing to which
its accumulation in sizeable quantities is practically impossible.

pesticides can accmlate in fish fat in rather sizeable quantities, and they can
enter the bodies of man and wild animals and birds through the digestive tract. In

some cases organochloride insecticides are used to kill trash fish in various water

basins. However, subsequent decontamination of such water basins proceeds rather
slowly.

Pesticides must be explosion-proof, noncombustible (they Inst have a high ignition
point), they must be easy to handle, and they should not attack ordinary metallic
and nonmetallic materials used in packaging and apparatus.

In addition to the requirements listed above, those associated with economics have
great significance as well: for example, presence of the raw material base, avail-
ability and cheapness of raw materials and production methods, low preparation con-
sumption norms per unit of treated surface, low cost and so on.

Besides general requirements, there are also particular ones imposed on individual
groups of preparations, for example fumigants, household preparations for parasite
control, herbicides, seed disinfectants and fungicides. 'lhese requirements will be
examined below.

Most Important Methods of Pesticide Application

Depending on the form of the preparation, different methods are used to process
plants. animals and materials.

Dusting, spraying and introducing preparations into soil in granulated form have the
broadest acceptance in agriculture. Treatment by liquid preparations is displacing
dusting more and more.

with ordinary spraying of plants, liquid consumption is from 200 to 2,000 liters per
hectare, it is from 5 to 50 liters for low volume spraying, and 1-10 liters per hec-
tare for ultralow volume spraying. new volume spraying means a dramatic rise in labor
productivity, owing to which a tendency for making broader use of this method can be
observed.

Ultralow volume spraying usually requires substances with extremely low volatility,
which makes it possible to control droplet size and obtain good results at minimum

preparation consmtion (32,33).

The optimum diameter of droplets to be sprayed from an airplane may be calculated
by the following formula, the results of which are highly probable:

where h-oheight of droplet fall, meters: v-wind velocity, m/sec, vcurate of droplet
fall due to gravity, m/sec. .'

The probability” that droplets of the substance would settle on the surface being pro-
cessed may be determined by the formula:

Anima1 parasites are controlled by pressurized spraying, by bathing, and more rarely
by dusting with solid preparations. Systemic preparations are added to teed.

When pesticides are used as antiseptics on non-stallic materials, the latter are

saturated with solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the pesticides, or pesticides
nixed with paint are applied to them.

Poison bait consisting of pesticide and food are broadly eaployed in rodent control.
he bait method is also used to control some insect pests, but due to its laboriousness,

it is being supplanted more and sore by inproved methods. the bait method using
attractants is moo-mended as a means for forecasting develop-ant of certain species

of insect pests and maintaining a record of their distribution. Attractants may
possibly be used in the future tor local destruction of pests.

POMS OP PESTICIDE USE

The success of using pesticides to control harmful insects, ticks, microorganisms .
and weeds depends to a great extent on the form of the preparation and on the condi-
tions under which the chemical compound comes in contact with plant pests, plant
pathogens, pests that attack stored foodstuffsmd destroy nonmetallic materials,

and undesirable plants. Because chemical compounds and the objects to which they

are applied are so diverse, a large number of forms of preparations must be created.
Depending on the physioochemical properties of the preparation's active ingredient,
its purpose and the means of its use, we select that form of its application which is
most effective and economical in the given concrete canditions.

The form of application we select goes a long way to define the process by which the
preparation is made.

In the world today, there are more than 100,000 different forms of application of
pesticides made from 950 different chemical cospounds. m ISA uses more than 2,500
preparations based just on organochloride insecticides alone (1,2).

The most important forms of preparations are as follows.

1. Powders (dusts)-for dusting and powdering.

2. Granulated (grainy) preparationsufor plant processing and introduction
into soil.

3. Microcapsulated preparations-~50: introduction into soil and plant processing.

4. Solutions in water and in organic solvents (including for ultralW V010” Plent-
spraying).

5. Hettable powders used in the form of water suspensions for spraying.

6. Emulsion concentrates that form sprayable emulsions when diluted with water.

7. Aerosols and fumigants.

8. Other forms of use--antiseptic and insecticidal soaps, paints, varnishes,
ointments, pastes, waxes, insecticide crayons, insecticidal and bactericidal
paper, various baits and so on. However, these forms of preparations enjoy
mre-limited'use, and they are produced in relatively small amounts. The only
exception is poison baits, which are the principal form of preparations used
in rodent control.

Powders (Dusts)

Insecticidal, fungicidal and herbicidal dusts and combined powders are mechanical
mixtures of a pesticide and an inert filler ground to a particle size of 3-30 u.

As the mixture is ground up. the pesticide particles are spread among the filler
particles, which they coat. In this connection grinding the pesticide together with
the filler produces a more effective preparation than separate grinding and subsequent
mixing of the ingredients. The more finely the active ingredient of a sprayed powdered
preparation is ground, the more effective is the preparation. This is explained by
the fact that preparations that are more finely ground cling to plants and insects
better, and they cover them more uniformly. (The usual dosage of dusts is 10 to 40 kg

per hectare. A rather fine grind would be required for uniform distribution of a
preparation over such a surface area.)

Pesticides can be turned into powdered state more or less easily depending on their
properties. Substances with a well formed crystal structure that is sufficiently
brittle and not very elastic are ground down the most easily. As an example pure

DDT with a melting point not less than 106°C grinds down easily. But technical-grade
our containing oily impurities is harder to grind; as it is ground, it cakes, forming
large claps that stick to the walls of the mill. Solid organic pesticides are usually
ground in the presence of an inert filler. The filler prevents caking of the prepara-
tion during both grinding and storage. The quantity of filler depends on its sorption
capacity. Thus for example when technical-grade DDT is ground in the presence of
silica gel (with a bulk density of 0.14 gm/cm3 ), S-lO percent filler would be enough,
while when ordinary kaolin is used, not less than 25 percent would be required. Caking
usually occurs when a preparation is ground in a ball mill. This apparently is
connected with the increase in temperature inside the mill resulting from collisions
of the balls, which causes partial melting of the substance being ground. In this
connection adding a larger quantity of filler and performing the process at the lowest
possible temperature would be desirable when grinding pesticides with a low melting

point .

Vost organic preparations to be made into dusts are usually ground in ball mills
equipped for air-jet separation. Sometimes grinding is performed in two stages:

First concentrated powder is prepared (in crusher-roll mills, in a ball mill or in
another type of machine). Then the necessary quantity of filler is added, and the
mixture is ground further in a ball mill. The best dusts are obtained with air-jet
mills, but this significantly increases the cost of the product owing to high consuma-
tion of electric power.

It has now been demonstrated that grinding a low melting point organic pesticide
together with amineral filler in a ball mill produces dust differing little from a

preparation obtained by saturating filler with pesticide dissolved in a volatile
organic solvent, followed by distillation of the solvent, since during the grinding
process the filler is coated by a thin layer of pesticide.

Interest has been shown in obtaining dust by mixing melted pesticide with ground

filler. Several modifications are known of this method of obtaining, in dust form,
low melting point pesticide having high plasticity. As an exanple dusts are easily
obtained in this way from a melted mixture of DDT and technical-grade y-hexachloro-
cyclohexane, from a solution of our in mineral oil and so on. In some cases adding

25

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

melted preparation to filler heated to 30—40°C is reconnended as a way to delay
crystallization of the pesticide (3-7). There are also other methods of making dusts
from melted pesticide. For example, melted pesticide can be sprayed in a chamber
similar to the sort used for spray drying. Filler is introduced into such a chamber

in suspended state. Pesticide droplets stick to the tiller particles and settle to
the floor of the chamber. Il‘he process may be adjusted in such a way that a completely

uniform dust is obtained. Dusts can also be obtained by precipitating pesticide vapor
on filler; however, this method could hardly be thought of as economically advantageous.

mats are made from liquid organic substances by mixing tiller with the pesticide.
When the pesticide concentration in the dust is very low, mixing is performed in
several stages (usually in two).

Figure 1 shows the general flow of dust production.

It the pesticide is a liquid, it is sprayed into the mixing unit through special
nozzles. In this case it is better to use pulverized tiller, which would exclude
the grinding stage and restrict the mixing process to just two stages.

'me concentrationtof active ingredient in dust depends on the effectiveness of the

pesticide. DD'rdusts usually contain 5-10 percent technical-grade preparation, thiophos
contains 1 percent and growth regulators contain 0.05-0.l percent.

Hydrophobic minerals such as talcum and pyrophyllite are usually used as fillers in
production of pesticide dusts; chalk, gypsum kaolin, diatomaceousearth,tripolite and
silica gel are used more rarely. The choice of filler must account not only for its
physical but also its chemical properties, since some fillers may catalyze decomposi-
tion of pesticides or have an effect on their photochemical stability. Thus for
example, alkaline fillers are not recomnded for making dusts out of esters, hydro-
carbon halide derivatives and so on. Esters may also be hydrolyzed in the presence
of acid substances. Introduction of special additives blocking the harmful effects
of the filler is recomsnded when ising such fillers. In some cases it would be
suitable to use mixtures of several fillers. Use of hydrophilic minerals such as
kaolin, clay and bentonite in the presence of high moisture is not recomended, since
dusts made with such fillers start caking readily after even slight wetting._

'iVo make dusts cling better to plants, hydrophobic substances may be added to them--
calcium stearate, mineral oils and so on. The stickiness of powdered preparations
and their ability to cling to plants determines the preparation's time of action in
many cases. 'mese characteristics depend not only on the shape of the dust particles
(this has great significance, of course) but also on the chemical composition of the
active ingredient and the special additives in the dust. The choice 0‘ 206i?” for

a given preparation must account for not only the method of its application but also
the crops for which it is intended.

wettable Powders

Wettable powders is a name usually given to powdered preparations which form rather
stable suspensions when diluted with water. In most cases more interest is shown in

pesticide suspensions than in dusts. Spraying plants and other surfaces with various
preparations is almost always more effective then dusting (given equal pesticide
consumption). Dusting is totally inappropriate in buildings to control mosquitoes,
flies and gnats, and for disinfection.

Suspensions are especially convenient when dusts cling poorly to the surface being
worked, fruits for exanple, and when emulsions are readily absorbed, owing to which
significant quantities of toxic residues remain on the fruit. Suspended particles
cling well to surfaces, and they & not penetrate, which means that they could be

washed off easily when necessary.
The following requirements are imposed on wettable powdered pesticides.
l. msistance to aging and absence of caking.
2. Quick formation of a suspension and slow settling of solid particles.
3. Good wettability of sprayed objects and easy spreading over their surface.
4. aetention on surfaces for a more or less long period of time.

One of the main conditiOns ensuring effectiveness of suspensions used to control
plant pests and diseases and weeds is small particle size of the preparation's

27

active ingredient. Good wettable powders usually contain not less than 80 percent
particles up to 3 u in size.

Hettable powders can be divided into three groups: preparations with a high active
ingredient concentration (from 60 to 90 percent), with a moderate concentration
(from 30 to 60 percent) and with a low concentration (up to 30 percent). The last
are usually made from liquid or waxy substances, because the preparation readily
cakes when the concentration of such substances in wettable powder is high.

Usually the composition of wettable powder includes, in addition to the active

ingredient, a tiller and a dispersant. Special stickers are also sometimes added

to preparations in order to raise their adherence to plants or other surfaces (5-8,
24).

Hettable powders usually have the following couposition (percent):

Pesticide . . . 10-90
Dispersan: . . . 2-10
Filler. . UptolOO

When preparations are made with a high active ingredient concentration, in almost
all cases the substances used are sufficiently pure, they contain no oily impurities,
and the tiller's bulk density is low and its sorption capacity is relatively high.

In particular, special grades of silica gel with a bulk density not greater than
0.15 gm/cm3 are reconnended. Some other hydrophilic fillers can also be used:
Aluminum hydroxide, synthetic calcium silicate and so on. Wettable powders can also
be made without a filler, it the preparation's active ingredient has a sufficiently
high melting point and if it grinds easily.

Various detergents are used to make wettable powders, including alkali metal sultonates
(sodium oxydibutyldiyhenyi sulfonate, sodium alkybenzene sulfonate, particularly
sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, sodium alkanesulfonate and so on) , alkylaryl esters
of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol (substances such as 0P-7 and OP-lO)

and so on. 'lhese substances are used to obtain wettable powders and pastes both

independently and in combination with other products, for example with sulfite-liquor
waste.

Sodium salts of aromatic sultonic acids and ligninosultonic acids are used as
auxiliary substances. Compounds usually used as film forming agents include carboxy-
methyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, unsaturated alcohol polymers, gelatin, animal
glues, caseinates, resinates and so on.

Highly concentrated wettable powders are obtained by grinding a mixture of pesticide,
filler and other ingredients in a colloid mill. Grinding in air-jet mills of various
designs produces good results. Grinding in ball mills produces coarser powders;

in this case grinding the pesticide together with the filler in the presence of

water produces satisfactory results. Next the paste is dried and ground a second time.

The process for obtaining wettable powders from crystalline pesticide is diagranmed
in l’igure 2.

Pesticides obtained by precipitation out of aqueous solutions may be used to sake
wettable powders without grinding. In this case all or the substances used to make
the wettable powder are added to precipitated and washed pesticides, and then dried
in a spray dryer. his method can be used to make vettable powders out of pesticides
such as copper oxychloride, zirae, curpous oxide and so on (25). Bowever. additional
grinding is sometime required. In addition to technical-grade pesticides the in-
gredients of such wettable powders usually include 2-3 percent 0P-7 auxiliary sub-
stance, 2-3 percent sultite-liquor waste and up to 5 percent carboxynethyl
cellulose. Rettable powders with an active ingredient concentration of 70-80 percent
have enjoyed the broadest use.

Pastas, which contain a small quantity of organic solvent and water in addition to
auxiliary substances, have properties close to those of wettable powders. However,

it is less convenient to use pastes because their composition may change during
storage owing to evaporation of some of the water or organic solvent. Stablepastes
are obtained by adding high molecular weight, water-soluble protective colloids having
a viscosity not less than 10 mPa-sec (10 centipoise) in a lo percent solution at 25°C.
Hethyl- and carboxymethyl cellulose are the most easily available substances with this
viscosity. Polyethylene glycol alkylarylates with a molecular weight of 400-600 are
used as surfactants. Pastes may be obtained by emulsifying the ingredients in a
liquid colloid mill at high temperature.

Hettable powders have been proposed having complex action, containing several

pesticides of different purposes. Use of such preparations in agriculture saves a
certain amount of labor in plant processing.

Emulsion Concentrates

One of the convenient forms of use of different pesticides is emulsion concentrates
which, when diluted with water, form stable emulsions. In some cases this form of
pesticide preparations has advantages over suspensions, since many liquid pesticides
can be used to prepare such concentrates without the need for solvents and fillers.
Given equal concentrations of the active ingredient, emulsions are more effective

as a rule than suspensions. In this respect they are similar to pesticide solutions
in organic solvents, but solvent consumption is many times lower.

Two types of pesticide emulsion concentrates are known.

, l. Emulsion concentrates obtained by dispersing, in water using a colloid mill,
pesticide dissolved in solvent immiscible with water. These concentrates would better
be called concentrated emulsions. Highly dispersed concentrated emulsions that are
stable when stored can be obtained by mechanical dispersion. Emulsions of this type
are used in agriculture, but they can only be made from pesticides resistant to water.
This method is used to obtain oil emulsions of DDT, hexachlorocyclohexane, anthracene
oil and some other preparations. concentrated emulsions are stabilized by the addi-
tion of sulfite-liquor waste.

Concentrated pesticide emulsions are obtained by mixing an aqueous solution of sulfite-
liquor waste with pesticide dissolved in oil or another organic solvent (the density

of the pesticide in the organic solvent must be close to unity in order to obtain
sufficiently stable concentrated emulsions). The resulting coarse dispersion is

fed into a mechanical homogenizer.

Homogenized concentrated emulsions can withstand low temperatures and prolonged
storage without significant changes. Sometimes they thicken when stored, but mixing
returns than to their normal state.

2. Pesticide emulsion concentrates (so-called miscible oils) usually contain a
sizeable quantity of pesticide. Mixing them with water produces stable emulsions.
Concentrates of this type consist of pesticide, organic solvent and emulsifier.

Use of solvent with liquid pesticides is not mandatory, though organic solvents often
make it possible to reduce the concentration of emulsifiers in the concentrate.

30

FOR!0FNKJAI.USE:ONLY
Solvents may include hydrocarbons and their halide derivatives, esters, various
petroleum products, Creolin. coal oils and many other compounds. Bstulsifiers include
calcim sulfonates, polyethylene and polypropylene glycol esters, higher fatty acid
semesters of sorbitol and nannitol, various soaps, naphthenic acid salts and so on.
Especially good results are obtained with mixtures of two or more emulsifiers. one

of which is a polyethylene glycol ester and the other is calcium alkylaryl sulfonate
or ameniun or alkylsulfate obtained free higher alcohols.

mulsion concentrate is obtained by dissolving the pesticide in the selected solvent
and then mixing it with the emulsifier while heating to «to-80°C. after it is cooled
the concentrate must be a honogenous mass without a precipitate. The concentrate is
filtered to remove mechanical impurities. A general diagram of the process by which
pesticide emulsion concentrates are acquired is shown in Figure 3.

Concentrates with not very high a viscosity may be conveniently used in agriculture,

but viscous concentrates would be safer in the case of highly toxic organophosphorus

compounds, since they are absorbed slowly if they settle on the skin, and they may be
easily washed off with water.

Disinfectants and insect externinating preparations are used in the form of emulsion
concentrates. Disinfectant soaps containing antiseptics and insecticides are emulsion

concentrates, as are various antiseptic pastes used to protect wood and other non-
metallic materials.

So-called "reversible emulsions" obtained by diluting appropriate concentrates with
water are broadly esployed. Enough water is added to obtain a product with a con-
sistency of a water-oil emulsion. These concentrates are used in low volume spraying,
since presence of an oil file rrevents droplet evaporation.

Special additives, for example butylamine stearate ("lovo" preparation) are intro-
duced to reduce evaporation of droplets sprayed from an aircraft or by other means.

Aerosols

One of the new forms of pesticide use in public health and agriculture is aerosols.

Much attention is being devoted to developing this application method.

Three basic ways of obtaining insecticidal and fungicidal aerosols are knovm.

l. The burning of various compounds containing insecticides, fungicides or bacteri-
cides that are volatilized to form smoke or mist toxic to.insects, fungi and bacteria.

Pesticides may also be vaporized by special heating instruments, electric lamps for

example .

2. The sprayingofpesticides dissolved in volatile solvents which, when they evaporate

in air, leave the pesticide in the form of a fine dispersion.

3. Ilechanical atomization of pesticide solutions with special spraying units. Some-

times this method is combined with the second. Heated solutions of pesticides in
organic solvents, mainly petroleum products, are sprayed. When the compound is

sprayed, some of the solvent evaporates, which reduces droplet size to that close to

aerosols. This method is known as low-volume finely dispersed spraying.

The simplest method of obtaining pesticide aerosols is to burn special mnoke boats,
paper and other flammable porous materials saturated with insecticides, fungicides

and bactericides. The ingredients of combustible smoking compounds include, in addi-
tion the pesticide, a combustible substance, filler and oxidizer. Nitrates, nitrites,

chlorates, chroutes, bichromates, persulfates and their mixtures are used as oxi-

dizers. Fillers promoting controlled burning include kaolin, diatomaceous earth

and so on. The necessary temperature is maintained by adding wood chips, wood pulp

production wastes, coal, bitumen and various tars.

when such compounds are burned, more than 80 percent of the insecticide is volatilized
without decosposition, and only 10-17 percent transforms into products that are non-

toxic to insects.

insecticidal paper which forms smoke toxic to insects when burnedis obtained by
saturating unsized paper with insecticide solution. The paper is first saturated
with an aqueous solution of sodium or potassium nitrite and dried.

32
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
Insecticidal smoke boats are effective against blood-sucking dipterans and pests
found in storage facilities. mey are also used in hothouses. Special tetraethyl
dithiopyrophosphate cartridges are reco-ended in the last case. It should be noted,

however, that because these coepounds are highly toxic to man, their use as mists
say be a serious hazard.

Use of smokes and mists obtained by burning smoke bombs does not produce a very good
protective effect against plant pests in the field.

Aerosols obtained by dispersing insecticide solutions in volatile solvents areusually
recs-mended 'or control of flies and other flying insects in enclosed spaces. Such
solutions are placed in metallic aerosol tanks supplied with a spraying device.
Pressure is created in the tank with carbon dioxide or a low boiling point solvent
(Freon, methylchloride and so on). This pressure promotes good atomization o! the

preparation. After the solution is sprayed in air and the_ solvent evaporates, the
pesticide remains in the atmosphere in finely dispersed state. Pesticide particle

size is related to the size of solution droplets, and it may vary within broad limits
depending on tank pressure and the design or the spraying device.

Berosols obtained by these methods are usually used to control insects or micro-
organisms that are very sensitive to insecticides; they are not used against plant

pests .

Aerosols made by mechanically dispersing pesticide solutions in organic solvents
are used in agriculture. new volume spraying of finely dispersed aerosols is

effective both in greenhouses and in large forests and fields; preparation consump-
tion is low with such spraying. Good results are achieved when granaries are
treated by this method (26).

Petroleun products with a relatively high boiling point serve as the solvents in
low volume finely dispersed spraying. Pesticide solubility is increased by adding
intermediate solvents (xylol, polymethyl naphthalene and so on). Many sprayer units
are designed to use exhausts from internal combustion engines to mechanically dis-
perse pesticide solutions. It should be kept in mind that some pesticide could be
lost with this dispersal method owing to its partial thermal breakdown. when this
method is used to obtain aerosols, the temperature requirements must be cosplied
with strictly in order to avoid the pesticide‘s breakdown.

Other Scrms of Pesticide Use

The brief description of the most important forms of pesticide use presented here

does not exhaust all of the avenues of euploying and making different forms of prepara-
tions. Thus for example, packaging is treated with insecticides (lindane, pyrethrins,
etc.) to control storage facility pests. Grain in such packaging suffers practically
no damage from storehouse pests.

The most toxic systemic insecticides are introduced into soil in gelatin capsules,
which precludes contact of workers with the toxic preparation. In the soil, the
gelatin gradually breaks down, and the insecticide is released into soil water and
absorbed by plant roots.

The poison bait method is extensively employed to control rodents, and fumigants are
often euployed to destroy pests attacking stored sfoodstuffs.

CHAPTER 2
HYDWCARBONS

To date, many hydrocarbons have been studied for their pesticide activity. however,
only a few of then are used to control harmful organism. ‘

Research has been conducted on the insecticidal properties of aliphatic hydrocarbons
from methane to hexacosane, including isomeric hydrocarbons, olefins' and acetylenes.
It has been established that the insecticidal and acaricidal activity of hydrocarbons
grows as their molecular weight increases, and that it achieves a maximum with para-
fins and isoparaffins witha molecular weight of 320-350, after which it remains
constant for the compounds studied thus far. A similar dependence is also observed
with unsaturated and alicyclic conpounds, with alicyclic hydrocarbons exhibiting
weaker insecticide properties than unsaturated hydrocarbons. The insecticidal
activity of unsaturated hydrocarbons grows as we proceed from olefins to acetylene:

and dienes. Branched-chain paraffins are more active than similar hydrocarbons with
normal structure (1.2). -

The fungicidal and herbicidal activity of paraffin hydrocarbons is insignificant.
Activity rises somewhat as we progress to unsaturated compounds. Ethylene has strong
defoliant action, and it hastens ripening of tomatoes and some other crops. Plants
placed in a charter containing traces of ethylene (up to 1 percent) quickly lose their
leaves. The defoliant action of ethylene and acetylene homologues is significantly
weaker.

The pesticidal properties of aromatic hydrocarbons have been studied in somewhat
.greater detail. Some of them are used in agriculture and industry, for example
benzene, toluol, xylols, ethylbensene, trimethylbensene, isopropylbensene, isopropyl-
toluene. sec- and_tert‘-butylbanzene, pentamethyl- and .hexanethylbenzene, dihydro-
naphthalene, tetralene, naphthalene, methyl- and polymethylnaphthalenes, diphenyl,
diphenylmethane', toluylene, fluorene, acenaphthalene, anthracene, dihydroanthracene,
phenathrene. chrysene, retene, terphenyl and some other polycyclic hydrocarbons. The
biocidal activity' of aromatic hydrocarbons is higher than compounds in the aliphatic
and alicyclic series, but in comparison with pesticides used today, their physiologi-
cal activity is low. Xylols. naphthalene homoloques, tstralene and other liquid -
aromatic hydrocarbons are used as solvents for chlorene- and phosphorus-containing
insecticides and some herbicides. Among individual hydrocarbons, only naphthalene
and diphenyl enjoy limited applications. Naphthalene is used in small quantities
both to control moths and as a grain fumigant, but it is being supplanted more and
more by other more effective preparations.

Diphenyl. which has a melting point of 70.5'c and density dis 1.156, is practically

insoluble in water and readily soluble in most organic solvents. The vapor pressure
of diphenyl varies with taperature as follows:

Pressure, mag . . . . . . 1 lo 100 400 760

The 1.050 of diphenyl in relation to rats is 3,280 lag/kg. Prolonged inhalation of
vapor containing 0.005 mg diphenyl per liter of air is hazardous to man.

One of the most important methods of obtaining diphenyl is pyrolysis of benzene. It
is isolated as a byproduct of various processes.

Diphenyl can inhibit fungal growth, which is why paper in which citrus fruits are
wrapped is saturated with it. It is reconnended that paper be treated with a melted
mixture of diphenyl and paraffin (111) at a rate of 30 gm diphenyl per 1 kg paper.
and 100 gm diphenyl per 1 kg cardboard (3).

The concentration of diphenyl in fruits has been standardized in a number of countries:
it must not exceed 100 lag/kg.

Petroleum Oils

Petroleum oils are the longest-known pesticides. They have been used against plant

pests and weeds many decades. According to available intonation crude oil was first
used to control plant pests in 1778, and kerosene has been used to control orange

scale insects since 1865. Despite such a long history of use of petroleum hydro-
carbons in agriculture. research is still continuing in this area.

Petroleum products are used as pesticides in agriculture in the following basic
directions:

1. For sumr spraying of fruit trees (sumuer oils).
2. To control wintering pests of fruit trees and ornamental plants (winter oils).

3. As solvents for various insecticidal, fungicidal and herbicidal emulsion concen-
trates and solutions intended for low volume fine spraying.

4. As solvents for insecticides and antiseptic: to control insect pests in the
home and to protect nonmetallic materials.

5. To control weeds occurring with umbeliferous and some other agricultural plants.

The principal requirements iuposed on oils used to control plant pests are as follows:
high toxicity to plant pests, harmless to processed plants, low toxicity to man and
animals, availability and cheapness.

37

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

Petroleum products used to make pesticidal preparations employed in greenhouses and
especially in animal buildings must not have an unpleasant odor, and they must not
contain substances toxic to man and animals. Preparations used in residential
buildings are usually made from the kerosene fractions of petroleum from which

sulfur compounds and aromatic and unsaturated hydrocarbons have been removed. In some

cases pesticide preparations are made from purified low boiling point petroleum frac-
tions and turpentine.

As was indicated above, one of the important conditions imposed on petroleum products
used to control plant pests or weeds is selectivity and harmlessness to useful plants.
It has been established that in relation to most plant species, the phytocidai
activity of mineral oils depends both on the physical properties of the oil and on
its composition and the structure of the hydrocarbons it contains. Aromatic and un-
saturated hydrocarbons which form acids that are highly toxic to plants when oxidized
by atmospheric oxygen make up the most phytocidal fraction of mineral oils. Paraffins
and naphthenes are oxidized slowly by atmospheric oxygen, and therefore their phyto-.
cidal activity is low (4).

Petroleum products can display their herbicidal action only when they contain a

high concentration of aromatic compounds. In this case substances toxic to plants
are produced as a result of conjugate oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons and compounds
of other classes. It has been demonstrated that the rate of oxidation of different
aromatic compounds by atmospheric oxygen is directly correlated with the light absorp-
tion spectrums of these compounds. These substances which have their absorption
maximum within the visible or near-ultraviolet portions of the spectrum undergo
oxidation the fastest. Phytocidal products are also obtained when hydrocarbons
interact with ozone, which is always present in the atmosphere in small quantities.

Petroleum products containing more than 10 percent aromatic and unsaturated hydro-
carbons can be used as herbicides, and oils from which aromatic and unsaturated com-

pounds have been removed can be used to control plant pests.

Petroleum products with a high concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons can be used
successfully as general herbicides.

In this case the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons with a boiling point of
lSO-300°C must be not less than 70 percent. Petroleum products containing about

20 percent aromatic hydrocarbons are used to control weeds occurring with umbeliferous
plants at consumption norms from 325 to 890 liters/ha.

Oils used in summer spraying of green plants must not contain significant quantities
of aromatic hydrocarbons (the unsulfurizing residue in sunmnr oils must be not less
than 95 percent). Engler viscosity should be within l.5-l.8°. oil having greater
viscosity is dangerous to plants because it can cause burns. When even relatively
safe oils settle on plant leaves, they are quickly absorbed, and if their viscosity
is high they may clog vessels, impairing the plant's vital activities.

Because acids also have phytocidal action, the acidity of answer oil must be not

more than 0.1 mg KOH per 100 gm oil. The emulsifier employed and various additives
have an effect on the phytocidal properties of oils (2,4-8).

looser requirements are imposed on the phytocidal action of oils sprayed on defoliated
plants and in early spring. There is information, however, that systematic spraying
of fruit trees with various oils reduces their frost resistance, especially if the

plants are processed in late fall.

Plants can be sprayed before budding by very phytotoxic oils. such as green oil,
which is aresidue of petroleum cracking. It contains a significant quantity of
unsaturated and aromatic compounds. This oil is toxic to most plant pests and store-
house pests. Fruit and ornamental trees and shrubs are sprayed with green oil emul-
sion to control scale insects, armored scale, psylla. aphids, ticks, and some other
pests.

The way in which oils act upon plant pests and their eggs is not entirely clear at
the moment; however, it is hypothesized that gas exchange is disturbed (access to
oxygen is hindered). the water balance of the insect and its eggs is disturbed,
outer coverings are disturbed (to include shells, which is especially inportant

to eggs» oils penetrate into the insect body or the egg and impair enzymatic pro-
cesses, protoplasm undergoes coagulation, and tissue structure is disturbed.

Disturbance of gas exchange is apparently the most important factor. This is con-
firmed by the high activity of oils having a large concentration of paraffins and
isoparaffins, which are resistant to oxidation and which consequently form a per-
sistent coat that prevents metabolism within the egg or in the insect body.

The requirements imposed on petroleum products used as pesticide solvents are the
same as those on oils used on their own. but in this case phytocidal activity has
somewhat different significance, since oils used jointly with insecticides and
fungicides are consumed in significantly smaller concentrations. In this connec-
tion even some aromatic compounds can be used as pesticide solvents.

It would be interesting to note that when unsaturated compounds are present in oils,
the activity of halide insecticides and some organic fungicides decreases. This is
connected with partial destruction of fungicides when they undergo conjugate oxi-
dation by atmospheric oxygen. Halide insecticides enter into a telomerization
reaction with unsaturated compounds as well as-with hydrocarbons contained in tur-

pentine.
Some petroleum products possess noticeable fungicidal action. This has been noted

particularly for petrolatum, which has been proposed for lumber protection and as
an ingredient of fungicidal pastes.

mm DERIVATIVES OF ALICYCLIC 820mm

General Description of Pesticide Properties

A large mnber o: halide derivatives of alicyclic hydrocarbons have been found to
have practical significance as pesticides. Some of them are now. produced on a large

industrial scale. In terms of. the amwnt produced, certain representatives or this
series have conceded only to our.

The dependence of insecticidal and fungicidal activity on composition and structure
observed for mono- and dihalide derivatives of alicyclic hydrocarbons is the same as
for aliphatic hydrocarbon derivatives. As a rule bromide derivatives are more active
than the corresponding chloride derivatives. Growth in the number of halogen atoms
per molecule somewhat increases the compound's activity, but only to a certain limit.

Systematic study or the insecticidal properties of large nunbers or ditterent halide
derivatives of alicyclic hydrocarbons showed that compounds with a molecular weight

below 480 and a melting point below zoo'c have insecticidal properties (1). compounds
with higher molecular weight and lower solubility in lipoids are practically inactive
as contact insecticides. which is apparently connected with their low permeability
through outer coverings and negligible rate of dittusion and movement through insect
tissues. '

A large number of valuable insectofungicidss have been discovered among halide
derivatives of alicyclic hydrocarbons with molecular weight below 480.

ﬂexachlorocyclohexane is a monocyclic derivative that has enjoyed broad use. aalide
derivatives of polycyclic hydrocarbons are represented by chlorindanol, heptachlor,
aldrin, isodrin, dihydroheptachlor, and dieldrin and endrin. ~

in insecticidal activity. It would be interesting to note that the mixture or

of toluol also exhibits high insecticidal properties in relation to a mother of
'insects. _

Hexachlorocyclohexane isomers diner in their solubility in organic solvents. They
dissolve rather poorly in paraftins and cycloalkanes, better in unsaturated hydro-
carbons, and even better in aromatic hydrocarbons. Their solubility in chloride
derivatives of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons is higher than in hydrocarbons.

lsomers are separated and pure v-nexachlorocyclohexane is isolated by capitalizing
on the different solubilities of these isomers in organic solvents. Methanol or

acetone '..'~ usually used for this purpose. these chemicals are capable of extracting
the yum-her from the reagent mixture.

The y-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane is volatile (vapor pressure at 20°C is
9.4'10‘° mm Hg); polychlorodiphenyls, polychloronaphthalenes and some other sub.
stances are often added to it to prolong its active life.

'lhe maximum permissible concentration of 3hexachlorocyclohexanes in air is 0.1 tug/m3,
while that of pure y-isomer is 0.05 rug/m3.

Hexachlorocyclohexane differs relatively little in chemical properties from other
halide derivatives of hydrocarbons in which halogen atoms are attached to neighboring
carbon atoms.

Sexachlorocyclohexane reacts slowly with water at room temperature; a noticeable
quantity of hydrogen chloride is liberated only when it is heated to lOO'C. Thus
when hexachlorocyclohexane is exposed to steam for 1 hour at about 102°C. about 0.13
percent of hydrogen chloride contained in the e-isomer is liberated. Heating of
c-hexachlorocyclohexane in the presence of water at 200°C in sealed tubes produces

l,2,¢~trichlorcbenzene and its hydrolysis products. The reaction is accelerated by
light and in the presence of alkali:

C.H.Cl. m CJ‘hcth" C.H.Cl. We? CJhCl.

Pentachlorocycloherane and tatrachlorocyclohexadiene impurities impart a typical
unpleasant odor to hexachlorocyclohexane. Very pure hexachlorocyclohexane has no
odor, and it is only when it is stored in the presence of light and moisture or
alkali that it acquires an unpleasant odor.

When hexachlorocyclohexane interacts with caustic alkali in alcohol solution and
when heated in aqueous solutions, it transforms into trichlorobenzene:

Cl

2 é} 612+ ii

The principal reaction product is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (a 75-95 percent yield).
Other products are 1,2,3-trichlorcbenzene (3-20 percent) and 1.1,5—-trichlorobenzene
(0-17.6 percent). The kinetic method of quantitative determination of the y-isomer
in a mixture is based on the differences in the reaction rates between caustic

alkali and the isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane.

Hcl is also split of: when this compound interacts with line, amenium and organic
anines. Decospoeition of hexachlorocyclohexane to torn trichlorobenzene and hydro-
gen chloride proceeds at higher tespersture (250-350°C) in the presence of substances
capable of initiating such decomposition (chlorine, iron, aluninm, their salts, etc.)
when chlorine is used as the initiator, part of the trichlorobenzene is chlorinated,
and in addition to trichlorobenzene, we get its chlorination products. In the
presence of excess chlorine. good yields of hexachlordbenzene may be obtained.

This reaction is used on an industrial scale to obtain tri-, tetra- and hexachloro-
benzene from nontoxic hexachlorocyclohexane isomers.

Hexachlorocyclohexanes undergo isomerization when heated to 170°C. In the presence
of iron chloride the reaction proceeds to not more than 50 percent completion; the
relative quantity of y-isoner formed did not exceed 4.4 percent in any of the experi-
ments run. when exposed to zinc dust in an acid medium, hexachlorocyclohexane trans-
form into benzene: this reaction is used for its quantitative determination. Hexa-
chlorocyclohexane reacts slowly with chlorine; its chlorination to undecachlorocyclo-

hexane has been reported. It also reacts with sulfides and thiocyanates or alkali
metals and some other substances.

Metabolism of y-hexachlorocyclohexane in the bodies of honeothernic animals, insects
and plants, and in soil has been studied (3-5). The first metabolite of hexachloro-
cyclohexane is always pentachlorocyclohexane. The next stage of metabolism proceeds
differently in the bodies or homothernic animals and insects.

'lhe optimum conditions for obtaining hexaohlorocyclohexane having the largest possible
concentration arm-isomer are as follows:

1. low chlorination teuperature (tron -20 to -30‘C). Conducting the process in
organic solvents is recommended because benzene crystallizes below +6°c. When
chlorination is performed'in excess benzene, keeping the telperature below are is
recomended. Chlorination at a lower temperature would significantly reduce the
reaction rate and consequently decrease the productivity of the apparatus. The de-
pendence of the yield of Y'imr on chlorination teuperature (6) is shown in Figure 5.

Following chlorination, the reaction product may be isolated from the reaction solu-
tion by many methods: by distillation of the solvent (or excess benzene) with live
steam in a vacuum at atmospheric pressure, by partial distillation of the solvent
(or excess benzene) or by separation of part of the product by filtration, followed
by subsequent distillation of the remaining solvent which live steam. For practical
purposes in the last case only a- ands-isomers are separated in the first filtra-
tion step, and the technical-grade product obtained following distillation of the

remaining solvent contains 30-40 percent y-iscmer. After drying, this product may
be used to produce lindane (see below).

Technical-grade hexachlorocyclohexane is also obtained on an industrial scale by
chlorination of benzene in the presence of aqueous solutions of caustic alkalis or
line at about O'C. The ingredients usually added to the apparatus include benzene,
ice and alkali solution. to which liquid chlorine is fed. During the reaction the
temperature increases somewhat. sometimes reaching 30°C. This process is more
difficult to regulate than the one described above. me technical-grade product
obtained by this method contains up to 18 percent y-hexachlorocyclohexane (2).

y-Hexachlorocyclohexane can be obtained from technical-grade product by extraction
with the appropriate solvent. The crude product is treated with a calculated quantity
of methanol (or another suitable solvent), undissolved u- and 5-isomers are filtered
out, and the filtrate is allowed to 0001. This produces technical-grade y-isomer
which, following separation from the mother liquor and drying, contains more than

90 percent target substance. 'lb obtain lindane, the preparation is recrystallized.
or u-isomer is separated from it by extraction. Thus the yield of lindane may be

more than 80 percent (12,18).

Not only the tewerature and the ratio of ingredients but also the crystal size of
the technical-grade product and many other factors have an influence on extraction.
y-Hexachlorocyclohexane is extracted best of all by multiple use of mother liquor
obtained following isolation of y-isomer (12).

Hexachlorocyclohexane is used to control various harmful insects--plant pests and
animal parasites. However, its use in animal husbandry is being reduced owing to

the possibility of its accumulation in animal tissues and its entry into milk and
meat.

Hexachlorocyclohexane is used in various forms: dusts, wettable powders. emulsion
concentrates, smoke bombs and so on.

Sexachlorocyclohexane is used to control plant pests mainly in the form of 99.5-100
percent y-isomer (lindane) . A preparation containing not less than '90 percent
rheuchlorocyclohexane is often used as an additive to seed treaters. Technical-
grade product containing 10-14 percent ,Y-isomer is rarely used today.

Also of practical interest are other isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane, so-called non-

toxic isomers which may be used to produce valuable preparations for agriculture and
industry. Some of these products are shown in Table ll.

Acquisition of. these substances from hexachlorocyclohexane isomers is shown in the
diagram on p 51 (19-22).

technical-grade hexachlorocyclohexane and lindane are ingredients of complex-action
seed treaters. Seed treaters are known to be combined with y-hexachlorocyclohexane
and ethylmercuric chloride (mercursn) , hexachlorobenzene (hexagamma), and copper
tetramethylthiuram disulf-ide and trichlorophenylate (fentiuram) and many other fungi-
cides. Usually such seed treaters contain, in addition to fungicide and filler, from

10 to 50 percent y-hexachlorocyclohexane.

5 -Hexachlorocyclohexane has also been suggested as an ingredient of seed treaters,
since it improves the fungicidal properties of some preparations. which makes it
possible to reduce the concentration of the active ingredients of the principal
fungicide, and of y-isomer.

Lindane is used together with our against the Colorado beetle and other pests. Such
a combined preparation has doubtless advantages, for example in the control of

synanthropic insects. In the latter case methoxychlor is also added to the mixture.

Polychloroterpenes

Polychloroterpenes were first used in the Soviet Union to control some animal para-
sites. A preparation made from the chlorination products or the pinene fraction 0!
gelipot turpentine with a bound chlorine concentration of up to 55 percent has been
used as an insecticide. However, this preparation cannot be used to control plant
pests due to its high phytocidal action, which is apparently associated with libera-
tion of hydrogen chloride in response to the action of light and water. A somewhat
less phytocidal product of pinene chlorination containing up to 66-68 percent chlorine

goes under the names of strobane and chloropinane, but this preparation's insecticidal
action is inferior to that of other known chlorinated ter'penes.

Research has been conducted on the chlorination products of many terpenes, .to include

pinene, casphene, dipentene, tenchene. phellandrene, carene, thujone and others,
but only a few of them are of practical interest. 2,6, 7-1'richlorocamphane has notice-
able insecticidal action. but it is also phytocidal.

1bxaphene (polychlorocamphene, khlorten): or terpene chlorination products, poly-

chlorocanphene (CloaloCle) , obtained by chlorination of camphene to a chlorine concen-
tration of 67-69 percent, is the best known.

'l‘oxaphene is a conplex mixture of polychlorocamphenes and polychlorocanphanes of
various structure; certain quantities of. chlorination products of tricyclene and re-
lated compounds may be present as well:

'l‘oxaphene is a white waxy substance with a melting point of 65-90'C and density
dis 1.6. It is practically insoluble in water, but it is readily soluble in many
organic solvents. Its 1.050 in rats is 60 mg/kg.

In the presence of toxic alkali: part of the chlorine splits of: easily in the form

of hydrogen chloride. When a hexane solution of toxaphene is heated in the presence
of pyridine and ma in methanol. it is turned. sClmiiother chlorinated terpenes produce

a similar reaction.

‘Do obtain toxaphene and its analogues by camphene chlorination, the reaction mixture
is usually illuninatedby various light sources. mlorination may be performed in
the presence of free radical initiators, for example azo-bis-isobutyronitrile (23).

Cmphene chlorination proceeds very swiftly at first, with large amounts of heat
liberated, but then the rate of chlorination decreases sharply, and the reaction

must be continued at higher temperature. However. considering the relatively low
thermal stability of the chlorination product. the reaction temperature must not be
too high. 'no reduce the viscosity of the reaction medium, chlorination is very often
performed in carbon tetrachloride, which is distilled away following chlorination

(24-26) . Figure 7 shows a flowchart for photochemical production of polychloro.

2. Chlorine

It should be noted that toxaphene slowly liberates hydrogen chloride during storage.

A small quantity of glycerin epichlorohydrin is added to stabilize it and to bind
hydrogen chloride.

Camphene would best be chlorinated in glass apparatus, since metallic apparatus
is easily corroded. Fbreover the metal salts that are formed (especially of iron)

catalyze toxaphene's breakdown. When glass chlorinators are used, the light source
may be located outside the apparatus. Daylight lamps are used most often as the
light source, though mercury lamps may also be used.

'noxaphene is used in the form of dust and suspensions, or in the form of emulsions
and solutions for low volume spraying and ultralow volume spraying.

One of the positive properties of toxaphene is its low toxicity to bees. The maximum
quantities of toxaphene allowed on fruits to be used as food are 7 mg/kg in the USA
and 0.4 lug/kg in the PEG.

“noxaphene produces satisfactory results in rodent control. For this purpose it may be
used in the form of dietary bait and as an oil mixture. In the latter case the pre-
paration is applied to burrow entrances.

Polychloropinene (khlorten): Polychloropinene is obtained by photochemical or ini-
tiated chlorination o! bornyl chloride to 64-67 percent chlorine. The pinene frac-
tion of galipot turpentine is usually used for production purposes: turpentine is
hydrochlorinated by the action of hydrogen chloride, and the resulting bornyl chloride

is chlorinated by chlorine (23,26-28). Bornyl chloride is chlorinated in all the same
conditions as camphene chlorination:

Polychloropinene is a viscous colorless oil having a consistency reminiscent of honey;
d§8 1.5-1.6. It is practically insoluble in water.and.it is freely soluble in organic
solvents. It is similar in chemical properties to toxaphene. The L050 is 350-525
m9/kg. The maximum permissible concentration in air is 0.2 mg/m3.

Polychloropinene's phytocidal action is superior to that of toxaphene. In contrast

to toxaphene. it is toxic to bees. Polychloropinene is used in the USSR for beet

pest control in the form of emulsions or oil solutions intended for low volume spraying.
The consumption norm is 1-2 kg/ha.

Polychloropinene is close to strobane in toxicity to fish. The nose to blue carp is
15 parts per billion with an exposure time or 24 hours (29).

Strobane (chloropinane): Strobane is obtained by chlorination of pinene to not less
than 66 percent chlorine. It is a dense viscous mass with dis 1.6 and n50 1.5790,
and its vapor pressure at 20°C is 3-10‘7 mm Hg. It is practically insoluble in
water, and it is freely soluble in organic solvents, for example in ethanol (12-14
percent). Its LDso in albino rats is 250 mg/kg.

Its insecticidal activity is about 1.5 times weaker than toxaphene.

Strobane is obtained similarly as polychloropinene. by chlorination of turpentine in
the presence of light (30) or in the presence of catalysts--Pcls for example (31).
According to patent data (30) the tirst step in obtaining strobane involves hydro-
chlorination of pinene with the purpose of transforming it into bornyl chloride. To
remove hydrogen chloride, the chlorination product is washed with diluted soda solu-
tion and water. chlorination is performed at SO-lso‘c (30).

Because strobane may liberate hydrogen chloride during lengthy storage. it is stabil-
ized by the addition of pinene (up to 2 percent). which binds hydrogen chloride,
transforming into bornyl chloride.

Practically all or the polychloroterpenes described above have a certain amount or
acaricidal action and exhibit extremely low activity as fungicide: and bactericides.

Owing to high toxicity to fish, polychloropinene and its analogues have enjoyed some
use in the destruction of trash fish in small water basins, but because of their

long active life and relatively slow breakdown, they should be used in this way with
caution. ' -

The preparation polidoﬂen (32), which contains DDT (20 percent), polychlorocamphene
(00 percent), the nonphytocidal fraction of diesel fuel tron petroleum from the
Archedinsk deposit, petroleuu solvent and OP-‘I emulsifier, has been suggested as an
insecticide to control cotton pests. '

Because of low cost and ease at production, polychloroterpenes have enjoyed rather
widespread use in agriculture, but owing to the couch shortcomings typical of all

stable organic compounds of chlorine, the use or these preparations is tending to
decline. But the scale of their use is still rather great. '

ALIPHATIC CAEOXYLIC mus AND THEIR WRIVATIVBS

Saturated aliphatic nonobasic and dibasic carboxylic acids have relatively low pesti-
cidal activity, and they have not enjoyed practical application.

The insecticidal activity of acids and their salts in relation to the leguninous
aphis increases as molecular weight increases, and it achieves its maxi-us with
lauric acid, after which it decreases.

Calciun propionate (013012000) lea, used in baking and cheese-making industry to im-
prove the storage qualities of baked goods and cheese, possesses fungistatic and
bacteriostatic properties. Propionic acid has enjoyed some use as a preservative.
Dithiodiundecanic acid has been proposed as a herbicide (6).

Unsaturated aliphatic acids possess significantly greater biological activity. They
have been found to have the properties 0! attractants, tungicides, herbicides and

plant growth regulators (1—5). Sorbic (tm,tm-hexadien-2,4-oic) acid has en-
joyed broad use as a feed preservative in aninal husbandry, and as a preservative in
cosmetics and various other products-

SOrbic acid is a white crystalline substance with a melting point of 134.5°c and a

boiling point of 228‘c at 760 m 39 (partial decosposition occurs). Its solubility

The pesticidal activity of acids grows dramatically when hydrogen atoms in the
alkyl radical are substituted by halogens. ‘i‘hus compounds as simple as acetic

monohalide possess significant pesticidal activity, and some of than are used in
agriculture and public health.

The pesticide activity of carboxylate! it higher as rule than the activity of free
acids and their salts. Amides or various aliphatic acids and their halide deriva-
tives are the nest active. Asides exhibit moderate insecticidal and acaricidal
activity, but they are rather strong fungicides and herbicides. More than 20 ali-
phatic acid amide‘s have achieved practical use in the control of plant weeds and
for other purposes. Acid nitriles and thio derivatives as well as derivatives of
dibasic aliphatic ’acids also possess pesticidai properties.

no toxicity of fluoroalkylcarboxylic acids to homeothermic animals depends on the
mate: of ca; groups separating fluorine from the carbon atoe of the carboxyl group.

Compounds with an odd mmber of ca; groups are more toxic. his is explained by
the fact that compounds with an even number or CH; groups are oxidized to form

The toxicity of. fluoroacetic acid is associated with a number of metabolic processes,
the most important one of which is formation of fluorocitric acid (21).

Fiuoroacetic acid amides may be used as systemic insecticides to control sucking
plant pests (22-32) and as herbicides (33).

used as aqueous solutions or, in dietary bait. Their now is 0.22-4 lag/kg. Due to
the very high toxicity of these preparations, only specially trained people are
allowed to work with then.

The amide and anilide of fluoroacetic acid (melting points 108°C and 75-76°c
respectively) have also been proposed as zoocides. They are less toxic to verte-

brates and safer to use. The toxicity of fluoroaoetamide to homeothermic aninals
(1.050) is 4-5 tag/kg. wnile the toxicity of fluoroacetanilide is 10-12 mg/kg.

N-Methyl-N-‘(naphthyl-l)-fluoroacetamide(MA) , obtained by any of the methods de-
scribed above (32), has enjoyed some use as a systemic insecticide. It is a white
crystalline substance with a melting point of 87-88'C. It is poorly soluble in
water and freely soluble in organic solvents. It may be used to control plant
pests as a wettable powder or an emulsion concentrate. Its nose is 25 lug/kg in rats

ties are possessed by mono- di- and trichloroacetic acids, di-, tri-, tetra- and
tetrachloropropionic acids, mono-, di- and trichlorobutyric and isobutyric acids

and many others. The biological activity of halogenated acids is significantly
influenced by the position of the halogen in relation to the carbonyl group.
a-Balogenated acids possess the greatest activity. Bronc- and iodo- acids have been
studied less, but active fungicides and herbicides have been found among them (47,48).

Acetic acid is chlorinated at high temperature in the presence of catalysts. Recently
sulfur or phosphorus has been used most often as the catalyst, in an amount equivalent
to 3 percent of the mass of acetic acid to be chlorinated (49). Chlorination of
acetic acid produces a small quantity of dichloro- and trichloroacetic acids as by-
products. By chlorination in harsher conditions this mixture is transformed into
trichloroacetic acid and is then used to produce herbicidal preparations (SO). Acetic
acid may be chlorinated in the presence of acetic anhydride (0.07 percent or the

Pure monochloroacetic acid is usually isolated by crystallization from the reaction

monochloroacetic acid contained in this mixture precipitates out, and the mixture
or high-chlorine products and unreacted acetic acid remains in liquid form, and
is separated by centrifugation.

Monochloroacetic acid is used in agriculture in the form of its soditn salt, obtained
by the acid's neutralization by soda or by sodium hydroxide at low temperature, since

at high temperature sodiun monochloroacetate transforms readily into glycolic acid.

Alkali metal trichloroacetates are used mainly to control monocotyledonous weeds
in sugar beets, alfalfa. sugar cane and other crops, in which case the consuption
norms of the preparation are relatively high (12-60 kg/ha). The preparations are
applied prior to sprouting or prior to planting, since crops can be injured when

and dried, and the mother liquor is used as a solvent to obtain new portions of salt.
A sufficiently pure salt is obtained in this way with minimm losses. When the pre-

paration is neutralized in diluted solutions followed by evaporative concentration,
a significant proportion of the preparation decomposes, and a highly contaminated
product results.

Dalapon is capable of moving through the plant vascular system, owing to which it
is highly active against many mnocotyledonous plants in relation to which other
herbicides exhibit low activity. The consumption norm is 12-40 kg/ha.

Alkali metal dichloropropionates react with water to form herbicidally inactive

pyruvic acid; therefore storage of their aqueous solutions for a long period of
time is not recomended.

Because the simplest halogenated alkane carboxylic acids are used extensively in
agriculture, the metabolism of chloroacetic acids and of dichloropropionic acid

in soil, plants, animals and microorganisms has been studied in rather great detail
(61). Decomposition of these compounds in soil may be represented by the following

Oxalic acid formed upon hydrolysis and oxidation of haloacetic acids transforms,
upon further oxidation, into carbonic acid, while pyruvic acid obtained from
dalapon may be included in Krebs' cycle to form amino acids and proteins.

ties are possessed by 2,3,5,S,S-pentachloro-Hetopenten—2-oic acid, which is a

Depending on the conditions of the process, the yield of mucochloric acid is 50-90

medium, great difficulties are encountered in selecting the chlorination equipment
and in waste treatment.

Mucochloric acid is rather highly poisonous, and when it settles on exposed skin

it causes severe irritation. Blisters recalling those produced by thermal burns

General Description of Pesticide Properties

The aryloxyalkane carboxylic acids and their derivatives that have been studied

possess weak insecticidal properties, but many compounds of this group are herbi-
cides, fungicides and plant growth regulators. nryloxyalkane carboxylic acids have

greatest significance as herbicides and plant growth regulators. In terms of the
scale 0: their production and use. aryloxyalkane carboxylic acids have the lead

among preparations or other classes; production of this important group of herbicides
is exhibiting a tendency for growth.

The physiological activity of many aryloxyalkane carboxylic acids has been studied,
and the general dependencies between variations in activity and structure have been
established. though the mechanism or their action upon plants is not yet surriciently
clear (1.102).

the physiological activity of phenoxyacetic acid increases when halogen atoms are
introduced into its molecule. Pluorine and chlorine have the greatest influence,
while that of bromine and iodine is less significant: moreover the activity of the
compound is also artected by the position or the halogen. 4-mophenoxyacetic acids
exhibit the highest activity. Isomeric dichlorophenoxyacetic acids fall into the
following order in relation to their physiological activity:

2.4- > 2.5. > 33' > 35' > 2.6.

me herbicidal activity of 2,5-dichloro- and 3,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acids is so
great that they have been proposed tor agricultural use together with 2,4-dichloro-
phenoxyaoetic acid. One favorable property 02 3,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid is

its greater selectivity of action in coqarison with the preparation 2.4-0: It is
less harmful to cotton, altalta, potatoes and sugar beets, but it is highly toxic to
sunﬂower and many dicotyledonous weeds.

Among isomeric trichlorophenoxyacetic acids, 2,4,S-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid
possesses the greatest activity: it is close to 2.4.1) in the strength of its

herbicidal action. Isomeric trichlorophenoxyacetic acids fall into the following
order in terms or their activity:

2A.!» > 2.3.4- > MS- > 2.3.5- > 3.4.6. > 2.3. ~

Among tetrachlorophenoxyacetic acids, only 2,3,4,S-tetrachlorophenoxyacetic acid
displays noticeable physiological activity in relation to plants, while 2,3,4,6~ and
2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenoxyacetic acids are inactive. Pentachlorophenoryacetic acid
is inactive as a plant growth regulator, but it is a systemic fungicide (2).

2,4,6—Trichloro- and 2,4,6-tribromophenoxyacetic acids are inactive as herbicides,
and according to some data they are even antagonists to preparation 2,4-0, but
2,4-dichloro-6-fluoro- and 2.4-dibromo-6-fluorophenoxyacetic acids are similar

to this preparation in their activity. 2,4,6-trifluorophenoxyacetic acid, many
mixed polyhalofluorophenoxyacetic acids and their derivatives exhibit relatively
high herbicidal activity.

Introduction of an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical into the benzene ring of the phenory-
acetic acid molecule raises the compound's activity insignificantly. In this case
the activity of 2-alkyl-, 4-alkyl, 2-halogen-4-alkyl- and 4-halogen-2-alkylphenoxy-
acetic acids decreases as the alkyl radical increases. A similar pattern is observed
when an aromatic radical is introduced into the phenoxyacetic acid molecule. when

the benzene ring of alkylo and arylphenoxyacetic acids is halogenated. their activity
rises.

4-Halogen-2-alkylphenoxyacetic acids are somewhat more active than 2-halogen-4-alkyl-
phenoxyacetic acids. Isomeric halomethylphenoxyacetic acids differ especially strongly
in their activity. When a second halogen atom is introduced into the alkylphenoxy-
acetic acid molecule. the compound's activity declines in most cases. The same is
observed with the addition of a third halogen atom. An exception is 2,4-dichloro-
-S-methylphenoxyacetic acid, which exhibits rather strong herbicidal action. This
acid is a structural analogue of 2,4,S-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid.

Introduction of a fluoromethyl group into the phenoxyacetic acid molecule does not
affect its activity as a plant growth stimulator, but it sharply reduces the com-
pound's herbicidal activity. Thus for example, 4-chloro-2-chloromethylphenoxyacetic
acid is of no practical interest as a herbicide. while 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy-
acetic acid (preparation 2n—4c) is broadly employed in agriculture to control di-
cotyledonous weeds (3,4).

Chloromethylphenoxyalkane carboxylic acids exhibit the properties of systemic
fungicides (5,6). A similar pattern is observed when a thiocyanomethyl group is
introduced (7). but such derivatives are somewhat more phytotoxic.

Acetylphenoxyacetic acids are inactive. apparently due to presence of a carbonyl
group in their molecule and the consequent possibility of forming additional hydrogen
bonds. The activity of phenylenediacetic acids and carboxyphenoxyacetic acids is
probably low for the same reason.

Among aryloryacetic acids containing an alkoxy group in their aromatic ring, compounds
with the alkoxy group in position 3 are most active, while 2-isomers are the least
active. By increasing the number of carbon atoms in the alkoxy residue. we can raise
activity, but only to a certain limit (C3), after which it falls abruptly. This is
possibly connected with the substance's lower rate of diffusion in plant cells.
halogenated alkoxyphenoxyacetic acids are less active than acids not containing
halogen. Thus 2-chloro-d-methoxyphenoxyacetic acid is close in its ability to
stimulate root formation in bean plant cuttings to that of y-(indolyl-3)-butyric acid.

4,5-Dichloro-2-methoxyphenoxyacetic acid and its derivatives exhibit noticeable
fungicidal activity (8).

A mixture of aryloxyacetic acids obtained from phenols with a boiling point of
180-200'C, obtained from dry wood distillation, has been proposed for weed control.
this mixture contains up to 40 percent chloroguaiacoloacetic acids (a mixture of
isomers) and about 25 percent 2,4-dichloro- and 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acids.

Nitro-, amino-, acylamino-, alkylamino- and sulfo- derivatives of phenoxyacetic
acids have low physiological activity. Even 2-nitro-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid and

its analogues exhibit low activity. Hanover, sulfamidophenoxyacetic acids exhibit
fungicidal properties (9,10).

Introduction or halogen into the methylene group of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid
reduces the compounds's physiological activity. Thus 2,4-dichlorophenoxytluoroacetic
acid is less active than 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, in which case the (+)-form
o: 2.4-dichlorophenoxychloroacetic acid is a stronger growth stimulator in relation to
pea epicotyl cuttings than the (-)-form and the racemic mixture, and it is more
active as a herbicide. The activity of 2,4-dichlorophenoxydifluoroacetic acid is
lower than that of monotluoro- derivatives.

Substitution of hydrogen in the methylene group by a hydrocarbon radical decreases

the cospound's activity as a rule: in this case the more carbon atoms there are in
the hydrocarbon radical, the more activity declines. The (+)-forms of stereoisomeric

cospounds are more active than racemates, while the (-)-£orms exhibit low activity,
or they are antagonists to plant 920“)! stimulators.

Aryloxyacetylchlorides and aryloxyaoetic acid anhydrides do not differ from the acid

forms in their activity, since upon hydrolysis they transﬂo'rm into the corresponding
acids.

Hydroxanic acids are herbicides and rather strong fungicides (11,12). Esters formed
from hydroxamic acids have strong herbicidal action (12-16). The activity of amides,

anilides and other similar derivatives is similar in most cases to the activity of
the corresponding acids.

A very large number of N-substituted amides or aryloxyalkane carboxylic acids (17-33)“!
both the aliphatic (l9,2l,24-26,29,31-34) and aromatic (20,22,23,25,30,35,36) series
containing the most diverse substituents in the hydrocarbon ring at the nitrogen
atomuthiocyanate (19). amino (21), alkylthio (24,28), carbonyl (22,32), trifluoro-
methyl (20,23,30) , thiophosphoryl (33) and other groups--have now been synthesized

and studied.

Aryloxyacetylamino acids enable high activity that depends not only on the structure
of the aryloxyaoetic acid but also on the configuration of the initial amino acid.
This may be connected with the capability of various plant enzyme for breaking
aryloxyacetylamino acids down into the corresponding aryloxyacetic acids.

Aryloxyacetylates are stronger herbicides than the free acids and their salts.
This is usually explained by the higher rate or their penetration through the leaf
cuticle. However, this cannot satisfactorily explain the fact that a significantly

74

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
lower dose or the ester is required to achieve the same effect as the salt (a two-
to three-told difference) (37). The herbicidal activity of the esters of high
mlecular weight alcohols is lower than that of esters or low molecular weight
alcohols, which is connected in all probability with their lower solubility in
lipoids and waxes and their lower rate of diffusion in plants.

The activity of the salts or aryloxyacetic acids formed from various organic bases
is 1.2-1.7 times greater than the activity or the salts of. these acids made with
alkali metals. It may be possible that the herbicidal action of amine salts in-
creases owing to change in the surface tension or their aqueous solutions. Other

factors responsible for the higher activity of these salts have not yet been
established.

In certain cases aryloxyacetic acids dissolved in organic solvents exhibit higher
herbicidal activity than do their salts and even their esters.

When hydroxyl oxygen in the carboxyl group of aryloxyacetic acids is substituted by
sulfur, significant changes do not occur in the compound's physiological activity,
while substitution of the ester oxygen by sultur or by other diatomic groups re-
duces the oompound's activity.

A large number of aryloxyalkanethiooarboxylates have been synthesized. Sens or them
may be of interest as herbicides and dessicants (38-41). Baters made with substituted
benzyl alcohols (42), with heterocyclic oxygen-containing (43,46), phosphorus-con-
taining (44) and nitrogen-containing compounds (45,46) and with dithiophosphoric

acid derivatives (47) also exhibit herbicidal properties. Arylthio— and arylsuli’onyl-

alkane carboxylic acids and their derivatives exhibit fungicidal and bactericidal
action (48).

Naphthoxyacetic acids are significantly inferior to phenoxyacetic acids in their
activity. of the naphthoxyacetic acids, B-naphthoxyacetic acid is the most active.
Introduction of halogens and other substituents into the naphthaline ring reduces
the compound's activity. However, the esters and amides of these acids as well as
the appropriate derivatives of s- and 8-phenoxypropionic acids (34,35,49,50) are of
certain practical interest because they are effective against a number of weeds
resiStant to other preparations made from this group of compounds.

Fluorenyloxy- and acenaphthenyloxyacetic acids and analogous derivatives of other
polycyclic hydrocarbons are weak herbicides, and they offer no practical interest.

Aryloxyalkane carboxylic acids [Aro(Cl-l2)nm0ﬂ1 with an odd number of methylene groups
has herbicidal activity in relation to many dicotyledonous plants. while acids con-
taining an even number of methylene groups do not display herbicidal action. The
explanation for this is that most plants (except the legumes) subject aryloxyalkane
carboxylic acids to B-oxidation, as a result or which the former group of compounds
is transformed into the appropriate aryloxyacetic acids while the latter group is
transformed into inactive phenols:

1n leguminous plants, B-oxidation of y- (aryloxy)-butyric acids to the corresponding
aryloxyacetic acids does not occur, and therefore y-(aryloxy)-butyric acids can be
used successfully to control dicotyledonous weeds in fields of leguminous crops.

As thsnurber of methylene groups in acids with an odd nulber of methylene groups in-
creases, their herbicidal activity decreases.

Nitriles of aryloxyalkane carboxylic acids display the same form .of activity that
acids do (51,52). Thus the nitriles of fluoro- and fluorochlorophenoxyalkane
carbonylic acids are strong herbicides (51). and the nitrile of pentachlorophenoxy-
acetic acid (melting point lSB-léO'C) is a strong fungicide (52).

Aryloxyacetic Acids

Aryloxyacetic acids and their various derivatives are used as herbicides to control
dicotyledonous weeds in cereal grain plantations and brush and tree seedlings on

meadows, to destroy undesirable trees when cleaning terrain for construction of hydro-
electric power plants and so on.

Coupounds in widespread use include 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), A-chloro-
-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (Zn-4C), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) and
their derivatives. 3,4-Dichlorophenoryacetic acid. 2,4-dichloro-S-methylphenoxy-
acetic acid. 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid and other compounds are presently undergoing
industrial experimentation. Z-Naphthoxyacetic acid is a plant growth regulator. It
is used in some countries in small amounts to obtain seedless tomatoes.

All aryloxyacetic acids are weak acids. ltheir dissociation constants are within
5.2.10-“-2s-1o-“.

Aryloxyacetic acids are similar in chemical properties to other carboxylic acids.
They typically form acid chlorides and anhydrides, amides, esters and many other
derivatives.

aryloxyacetic acids form depending on the nitration conditions and the structure of

When aryloxyacetic acids are subjected to halogenation, the corresponding halogen
derivatives are formed, some of which are obtained rather pure and in good amounts.
his reaction is often used for industrial synthesis of 2,4-D. 2n-4c and 4-fluoro-
phenoxyacetic acid. Chlorination and bromination proceed the most easily, while

iodination is significantly more difficult. Some aryloxyacetic acids are not
iodinated by free iodine.

Hydrolysis of the simple ester bond proceeds relatively easily when aryloxyacetic
acids are heated together with acid halides. The reaction proceeds quickly with
hydrogen iodide and significantly more slowly with hydrogen chloride. The more
acid the phenol obtained upon hydrolysis. the faster this reaction proceeds.

Esters are obtained in good amounts when aryloxyacetic acids interact with alcohols
in the presence of catalytic quantities of sulfuric acid or other similar compounds.
The reaction between aryloxyacetic acid salts and dimsthylsulfate (53) or between
the acids themselves and tetramethylamoniua hydroxide (55) is used to synthesize
methyl ethers of these acids, which are use: in chromatographic analysis.

Several general methods of obtaining aryloxyacetic acids are known.

1. Oxidation of aryloxyethanols by various oxidants or oxygen in the presence of
catalysts:

2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a white crystalline substance with a
melting point of 141'C and a boiling point of 160°C at 0.4 an Hg. The pure acid is
practically odorless. Not more than 0.3 percent dichlorophenol is permitted in
technical-grade preparation. Ite solubility in water at 20°C is 540 lug/liter;
solubility in 100 gm solvent is, at 25°C, 130 gm for ethanol, 243 gun for ester,
0.67 91: for toluol and 0.1 gm for n-heptane. It is readily soluble in benzene,

carbon tetrachloride, acetone and tetra- and pantachloroethanes. The dissociation
constant is 23-10“.

2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid is stable when stored as solutions in various solvents,
and when stored in :rystalline state; it may decompose to a slight extent when ex-
posed to ultraviolet light. It forms stable salts with inorganic and organic bases.

2,4-D is moderately toxic to mammals. When introduced orally into experimental
animals, the LDso is 37S-l,000 mg[kg; the maximum sate dose in monkeys is 214 mg/kg.

To decrease hydrolysis of monochloroacetic acid, the reaction may be performed with
excess 2;4-dichlorophenolate, which is removed after oxidation of the reaction
medium by distillation with live steam. The yield from 2 moles of sodium 2,4-di-
chlorophenolate and 1 mole of sodium nonochloroacetate attains 94 percent or theoret-
ical, while without excess phenOlate the yield under similar conditions does not
exceed 83 percent. 2,4-Dicblorophenol distilled away with steam may be later re—
turned to the process. Adding sodium chloride has been suggested as a way to suppress
hydrolysis in the reaction mixture.

It should be noted that the purest possible 2,4-dichlorophenol would best be used to
produce 2,4-0: this would mean lower waste of expensive monochloroacetate in the
formation of byproducts.

Additionally, the 2,4-0 obtained from pure 2,4-dichlorophenol is higher in quality.

The technical-grade preparation almost always contains a small quantity of 2,4-di~
chlorophenol, and owing to this it has an unpleasant odor.

2,4-Dichlorophenol is obtained by direct chlorination of phenol by chlorine, followed
by purification of the chlorination products by rectification. Performing chlorina-
tion at a temperature somewhat ibove the melting point of phenol is usually recosnended.
chlorination at higher temperatures produces a large quantity of 2.6-dichlorophenol

as a byproduct. very pure (98 percent) 2,4-dichlorophenol may be obtained by chlori-
nation of phenol in liquid sulfur anhydride at a temperature not exceeding the boiling
point of sulfur anhydride, which hinders tormation of the 2,6~isomer and practically
excludes the possibility of obtaining 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. Sufficiently pure
2,4-dichlorophenol is also obtained when phenol is chlorinated in nitromethane (the
phenol concentration should be about 25 percent, the temperature is 40°C) (61-63).

2,4-Dichlorophenol may be purified by extraction of the 2,6-isomer with alkali (60),
since the latter's acidity is higher.

2,4-Dichlorophenol may also be obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of a mixture of iso-
meric forms of trichlorobenzene (from nontoxic isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane).

but the resulting product is a mixture of isomeric dichlorophenols, in which the
concentration of the needed isomer does not exceed 25 percent.

2.4- and 2,5-isomers o: dichlorophenol may be separated by sultation with sulfuric
acid at SO-lOO'C: The 2,5-isomer is separated in the form of sulfonic acid, since
it is sulfated more easily than the 2.4-isomer (64). Separation may also be

achieved by precipitation of the binary compound of 2,5—dichlorophenol and urea
out or their solutions in organic solvents (65).

The metabolism of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in various environmental objects
has been studied (68-80). It has been established that the first stage of metabolism

in plants is hydroxylation (71,79,80). which proceeds to form 2,3- and 2,5-dichloro-
-4-oxyphencxyacetic acids. Uhder the influence of soil microorganisms, not only does
the ring undergo hydroxylation, but also the ester bond breaks down and the aromatic
system is destroyed (70.71.74). It should be noted that when 2,4-D is applied re-
peatedly to soil, its decomposition accelerates. Decomposition of 2,4-dichloro-

Esters or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid: The effectiveness of esters derived from
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid against various weeds is significantly higher than

the effectiveness of its salts and of its various other derivatives. Destruction of
an equal amount of dicotyledonous weeds by esters requires consumption norms that are

two to three times lower than the consumption norms for the sodium salt (as corrected
for the acid). In a number of cases esters act upon weeds against which salts are
not very ettective.

2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetates are enjoying increasingly broader use in agriculture.

They now represent more than 50 percent or the total production of all other deriva-
tives of this acid.

Lower alkyl esters o! 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (ethyl, isopropyl, butyl and

so on) have relatively high volatility, and their vapors may injure crops sensitive
to this acid located on plots neighboring those being processed. As molecular weight
increases, the volatility of the esters decreases. Thus the vapor pressure of iso-
octyl ester is almost 17 times lower than the vapor pressure of butyl ester. however,
high molecular weight esters such as, for example, cetyl ester, are less effective,

apparently due to their poor solubility in plant juices and their slow movement
through the plant vascular system.

2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetates are produced industrially by esterification of the

to mamnals is close to that of 2,4-D, and its L050 is 590-l,000 mg/kg. Technical-
grade preparation containing related compounds is somewhat more toxic than pure

quires special purification.

4-Chloro-2-methylphenol is obtained by chlorination of o-cresol by chlorine, by

alkali metal hypochlorites or by sulfuryl chloride. The purest 4-chloro-2-methyl-

when o-cresol is chlorinated by chlorine and by other chlorinating agents, the

4,6—dichloro-2-msthylphenol. to isolate pure 4-chloro-2-methylphenol, the technical-
grade product is subjected to rectification.

6-Chloro-2-methylphenol is used to produce antiseptic for nonmetallic materials,

and to synthesize polyethylene glycol esters which, when mixed with 4-chloro-2-methyl-
phenoxyacetates, are used as herbicides to control weeds on grain fields resistant

to 2M-4c.

The second method of obtaining 2M-4C is of great interest: chlorination of 2-methyl-
phenoxyacetic acid by chlorine or hypochlorite. This process is usually conducted
in dry organic solvents, with and without catalysts. chlorination is easier in
water-free solvents, since corrosion of the apparatus decreases dramatically and
the resulting preparation contains almost no impurities. Halogen derivatives of
aliphatic hydrocarbons and esters. and their mixtures have been proposed as solvents.

it has enjoyed broad application. This herbicide is especially convenient against
weeds in flax plantations and sou other crops.

melting point of 158-159'c. lts solubility in water at 20‘C is 0.189 galliter. It
is freely soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform and benzene, and it is moderately
soluble in toluol and paraffin hydrocarbons. Its 1.050 in rats is 500 mg/kg.

Despite the fact that in relation to its acute oral toxicity 2,4,5-‘1‘ is classified
as a moderately toxic preparation. its use has recently been severely limited. The
reason for this is that small quantities of 2,3,7,8—tetrachlorodibenzodioxine have

been detected in the technical-grade product. Even in minim doses, this compound
has a teratogenic effect on both animals and man (86-88).

The properties of some salts of 2,4,S-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid are presented
below:

The principal mthod used to synthesize 2,4,S-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid is to heat
concentrated aqueous solutions of 2.4,S-trichloropheny1ates and monochloroacetatee
of alkali metals at pl! 10-12 and a temperature of 103-107‘C.

This process may be performed in butanol, but this method is less convenient since
greater difficulties are encountered in removing. from the 2,4,S-trichlorophenoxy-
acetic acid. trichlorophenol that had not reacted with monochloroacetate.

When sodium hydroxide reacts with 2,4,5-trichlorophenol small quantities of tetra-
chlorodibenzodioxine form as a byproduct. Not only does this compound exhibit
teratogenic action. but it also severely irritates the skin. This was a cause of

occupational illnesses among workers (87). Formation of tetrachlorodibenzodioxine

u—(4-Chloro-2-methylphenoxy)-propionic acid (2M-4CP) is a white crystalline substance
with a melting point or 94-95’6. Its solubility in 100 ml water at 20°C is 0.06 gm.

'lhe solubilities of salts in water at 20' are: 32 percent (corrected for acid) for
the potassium salt and 58 g: in 100 ml for the diethanolamine salt; solubilities in
100 ml water at 0°C are: 26 gm tor the sodium salt, 0.45 gm for the calcium salt

and 4.5 gm for the magnesia: salt. The tree acid and its salts are stable when
stored.

‘lhe active form of the acid is the (+)-torm. Its 1.050 in mice is 650 mg/kg.

2H-4CP is used against weeds in the form of salts of alkali metals or amine salts

(ethanolamines. diethylamine) at consantion norms of 2-2.5 kg/ha. It is one of the
new herbicides used against bedstraw and cannon chickweed on grain fields.

would best be performed in water-free hydrophobic organic solvents, similar to that

used to make preparation 2M-4C. The acid can be extracted from organic solvents
with an aqueous solution of alkali or a lower amine. In the latter case we obtain

a comercial product having the form of an aqueous solution of amine salts with a
minimal phenol concentration (98).

u-(2,4-Dichlorophenoxy)-propionic acid (2.4-DP, dikhlorprop) is a white crystalline

The herbicidal activity of 2,4,5-TP is close to that of 2,4,S-T, but it is safer to
cotton, which permits its use against woody vegetation and brush in cotton growing

regions. When pears are sprayed in fall, the yield in the following year increases
somewhat.

a-(2,4,S-Trichlorophenoxy)-propionic acid is obtained by reacting sodium 2,4,5-tri-

been found to be rather active selective herbicides, but they have not as yet en-
joyed practical use in agriculture.

In addition to derivatives of phenoxyacetic and phenoxypropionic acids, derivatives
of 3-naphthoxyacetic and a-naphthoxypropionic acids have recently found some uses.
Salts of d-naphthoxyacetic acid are used to obtain parthenocarpic tomatoes, while
its methylester is used as a herbicide.

The methylester of ennaphthoxyacetic acid is a white crystalline substance with a
melting point of 75°C. It is practically insoluble in water, and it is soluble in
most organic solvents. Its L050 to rats is 2,800 mg/kg.

It is obtained by esterification of the acid with methanol, similarly as in obtaining
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetates. It is produced in the form of a wettable powder. When
used at consumption norms on the order of 3 kg/ha, it exhibits good results against
field camomile and (romashka nepakhuchaya) [unscented daisy?].

l-(2',4’-Dichlorophenoxyacetyl)~2,S-dimethylpyrazole (tomakon) is a white crystal-
line substance with a melting point of 136°C. Its L050 in mice is about 1,100 mg/kg.
It is used as a tomato growth regulator in the form of a 0.15 percent aqueous dis-

Perchloromethylmercaptan and Its Derivatives

Owing to its high toxicity to man and animals and its strong corrosive action, per-
chloromethylmercaptan is not used in agriculture. It is the principal raw material

for synthesis of various trichloromethylthioimides and trichloromethylthioamides
possessing fungicidal properties.

Perchloromthylmercaptan is a red oily liquid with a boiling point of 148°C at
760 m Hg (partial decomposition occurs) and 73-c at so mm Hg. 63° 1.6947. 1: is
so toxic to mammals that it was proposed as a toxic agent in World War I, but for
practical purposes it was almost never used for this purpose. .

Perchloromethylmercaptan reacts relatively easily with unsaturated compounds to pro-

As a rule these sulfides are strong fungicides. and they kill many species of phyto—

The byproduct of this reaction is sulfur chloride, the separation of which presents
certain difficulties; Ihe sinplest laboratory method of purifying perchloromethyl-
mercaptan is to distill it with live steam. In this case sulfur chloride is broken
dowu conpletely by water, but the perchloromethylmsrcaptan yield decreases to 10-15

percent owing to its hydrolysis by water. However, this method of purifying per-
chloromthylmercaptan is difficult in industrial conditions owing to the high

oorrosiveness of the medium. The second (industrial) method of removing sulfur
chloride from perchloromethylmercaptan is to rectify it in a vacuum. but in this

case the purified preparation contains up to 3 percent sulfur chloride. and repeat
rectification means significant losses of the product.

Purifying perchloromethylmercaptan by processing it with sulfuric acid at a tempera-
ture not higher than lO'C has been proposed. In this case the sulfur chloride trans-

A very large number of derivatives of trihalomethyleulfenic acid have now been

N-Trichloromethylmercapto-l,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimide (captan) is a white almost
odorless crystalline substance with a melting point of 172'c. The technical-grade
product is yellow or gray. and it has the typical odor of perchloromethylnercaptan
and thiophosgene, with a melting point of 164°C. It is practically insoluble in
water, and it is poorly soluble in most organic solvents. Its L050 in rats is
9,000 mg/kg. No abnormal deviations were noted in the course of a year and more
when the preparation was introduced into animal feed. It may cause slight irrita-

Captan is produced in the form of 50 percent wettable powder and 75 percent prepara-

tion as a seed disinfectant; it is used for plant protection at a concentration of
0.3-0.5 percent.

Captan is used as a broad-profile protective fungicide to control various diseases
of agricultural plants, including as a disinfectant of the seeds of a number of

crops. When grapes are processed with captan, the latter has an unfavorable effect
on alcohol fermentation during wine production, since it inhibits development of
yeast fungi.

N-Trichloronethylnercaptophthalinide (ftalan, phaltan) is a white crystalline sub-
stance with a lelting point of 177°C. It is insoluble in water. and it is poorly

soluble in ordinary organic solvents. Ptalan is mildly toxic to manuals, and its
L050 in rats is more than 10,000 nag/kg.

Hydrolysis liberates a large quantity of hydrogen chloride and therefore. as is

It is produced in the form of 50 percent wettable powder, and the concentration of
the active ingredients of the applied product is 0.2-0.3 percent.

Ftalan is obtained similarly as with captan. by reacting perchlorouuethylmercaptan
with phthalilnide in the presence of sodium hydroxide in an aqueous medium. When
sufficiently pure perchloronsthylnercaptan is used, the ttalan yield is about

90 percent of theoretical. The main inpurity in the technical-grade product is the
initial phthalinide thatdid not react or that tamed as a result of hydrolysis: a
slight quantity of sulfur is present as well.

Phthalinide and its analogues are formed with a practical quantitative yield when
phthalic anhydride is heated in the presence of urea to 130-140'c (35).

It is less difficult to obtain this product than perchloromethylmercaptan, and there

Ditolatan is produced in the form of a 50 percent vettable powder, and it is used

similarly as captan and ftalan. The main crops for which this preparation is
reoomended are potatoes and grapes.

A large number or other similar compounds have been synthesized as well. but they
have not yet found applications in agriculture.

N—‘i‘richloromthylsulfamides of aliphatic sulfonic acids are close in fungicidal
activity to captan. while the corresponding amides of aromatic sultonic acids are
significantly less active. Introduction of a trichlorouthylmercapto group does

not always raise the activity or sulronic acid asides. Thus N-(trichloromethyl-nercapto

The fungicidal activity of compounds containing a trichlorouethylnercapto group is
connected, in the opinion of sany researchers, with the high reactivity of this

ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS WORDS

General Description of Pesticide Properties

One of the most important classes of modern pesticides is the organic compounds of
phosphorus. more than 100 of which are used in agriculture. Among the organic phos-
phorus compounds, substances have been found with different pesticidal properties,
toinclude insecticides, acaricides, nenatocides, herbicides, defoliants and fungicides.

Organic phosphorus compounds are used especially broadly to control plant pests and
the ecto- and, in part, endoparasites of domesticated animals.

The scale of application of organic phosphorus cospounds as pesticides is close to
the scale of use of organic chlorine compounds in agriculture.

World production of the most important preparations in this class. intended for con-
trol of weeds and plant pests and diseases, has now exceeded 150,000 tons per year,

and the nutter of preparations now in use is nearing 150. Such swift growth in the

production and application of organophosphorus pesticides is connected with a number
of their positive properties, the lost important ones of which are:

1. High insecticidal and acaricidal activity and broad spectrum of action
against plant pests.

2. The possibility of having compounds with the most diverse persistence.
the decomposition of which in different living organisms proceeds with
formation of compounds that are practically nontoxic to nan and aninals.

3. Relatively fast metabolism in the vertebrate body and absence'of a
capability for deposition in the body, as well as relatively low product
toxicity or its couplets absence.

4. systeaic or deep action of a number of preparations.

5. Low consuption of preparations per unit of worked surface and fast
action against plant pests and animal parasites.

6. Past decomosition in soil and moderate toxicity to fish.

One negative property of many organophosphorus oonpounds is their relatively acute
toxicity to vertebrates. which requires compliance with the appropriate precautionary
measures when using the}. A large number of organophosphorus compounds that are
moderately or mildly toxic to annals have also been synthesized in recent years.
Such conpounds are fully safe to use in agriculture.

msearch on the mechanism of action of organophosphorus compounds upon manuals and

insectsshowed that in the animal body. they phosphorylate vitally inportant esterases,
inhibiting their normal functions. It is believed that the action of these coupounds

is based mainly on inhibition of cholinesterase, the physiological functions of which
are very isportant in the animal body. Cholinesterase hydrolyzes acetylcholine:

e (IE-ll O
(CH,),NCH.CH.OCOCII, —’ (CH,),NCH,CH.OH + CH.CO0II

The mechanism by which cholinesterase is inhibited by organophosphorus compounds may ’
be diagramsd as follows (1-4.549):

At first. esterase apparently forms a complex with the organophos-phorus conpound.
This coupler then breaks down to produce an esterase phosphorylation product and

the corresponding oxy cowound. Phosphorylated esterase may be gradually hydrolyzed
by water, which restores its esterase activity. The rate of dephosphorylation is

so low for some substances that it does not have practical significance. Thus for
example. dephosphorylation of cholinesterase inhibited by tetraethylpyrophosphate
proceeds very slowly in water. and in 28 days only 50 percent of the initial activity
is restored:

CI|EP(OR’), + ",0 -e ChEll + HOFOR’).

The activity of organophosphorus compounds depends strongly on the structure of the
ester groups in the molecule of the phosphoric acid ester: nor is the structure
of each of the radicals immaterial. Thus for eunle, 0,0-diisopropyl-o-4-nitro-
phenylthiophosphate is almost 100 times less active against bee cholinesterase than
0,0—diethyl-O-d-nitrophenylthiophosphate.

For maximum effect. the organophosphorus molecule mst have a ”lock and key" fit with
the active centers of the esterase (5).

It is entirely obvious that the activity of the same compound would differ in rela-
tion to cholinesterase from different species of animals and insects. This is

connected with the difference in the structure of cholinesterase from different
organism (l,-'.) and with differences in the metabolic pathways of organophosphorus
compounds in the insect and animal body (2). Thus for exanple, carbofos undergoes

while pyrophosphoric acid octamethyltetramide transforms in the animal body into a
product that is more toxic than the initial coupound.

'no correctly understand the reasons why specific organophosphorus compounds are toxic

to particular species of animals, we need to know not only the general mechanism of
their action but also their metabolism within the given animal species.

Very often the activity of a compound in relation to cholineetarase is associated

with the organophosphorus compound's rate of hydrolysis, which is not always valid:
Activity also depends on the steric features of molecular structure.

In addition to hydrolysis and the structural features of organophosphorus molecules,
the rate of dealkylation of phosphoric acid esters also has a great influence on their
toxicity (6). Phosphate dealkylation is apparently the principal reaction in the
animal body carpeting with phosphorylation of cholinesteraee. mat methylphosphates
are less toxic to manuals than homologous esters can be explained by dealkylation of
phosphoric esters. In this case esters are decomposed by dealkylation before they
reach their place of action, as was first asserted by the author hack in 1961. This
point of view has now achieved substantial confirmation (7).

Various phosphorus cospounds are used as pesticides, to include derivatives of
phosphorous and thiophosphorous acids, thic- and dithiophosphoric acids, and phos-
phonic and thiophosphonic acids.

In contrast to the situation with most other classes of compounds, the nomenclature
of organophosphorus cospounds has not been adequately worked out yet, and different
countries use their own naming systems. In most cases organophosphorus compounds
are interpreted as derivatives of the appropriate acids and hydrogen phosphide--
phosphine.

Derivatives of phosphorous acid have “its" endings while derivatives of phosphoric
acid have "ate“ endings. For example the diethyl ester of phosphorous acid (I) is
called diethylphosphite, while the diethyl ester of phosphoric acid (II) is called
diethylphosphate :

Phosphorous Acid Derivatives

Research on the pesticidal properties or a large number of phosphorous acid deriva-
tives established that many compounds in this series have weak insecticidal and

acaricidsl activity, but some derivatives of phosphorous and thiophosphorous acids
have high herbicidal activity.

The herbicidal activity of esters cf phosphorous acid increases as the nuuber or
carbon atone in the aliphatic ester radicals grows. Complete esters formed from
phosphorous acid and haloaryloxyethanols display the greatest activity; one such
compound used in agriculture is falone.

Tributyltrithiophosphite has enjoyed rather broad use under the names mertos and
foleks as adefoliant or cotton and sons other crops (9). The compound is also active
when combined with the most diverse compounds including tertiary amines.(lO). Other
active detoliants are dibutyldithiochlorophosphite (ll) and triarylphoephites (l2).

CYclic pyrocatechol chlorophosphites (13) and diallylphosphite (14) exhibit fungi-
cidal action. Cyclic phosphite (:01) has been proposed as an insect sterilizer (15).
Phosphites are broadly euployed as internediate products in the synthesis of. a large

3. Dialkylphosphites can also be obtained by oxidation of white phosphorus in the

appropriate alcohol (17). The yield of diethylphosphite in this case is about
43 percent.

Of these methods, the first has the greatest practical significance. It is used
extensively in industry. The reaction is usually performed in an inert organic
solvent at low teuperature (18). A convenient solvent for acquisition of :inethyl-
chlorophosphite would be methylchloride, which acts here as a coolant as well,
since the reaction is usually performed at its boiling point (-24°c). this method
can also be used to obtain diallryphosphites with mixed radicals (19) and alkylaryl-

phosphites (20,21), using a mixture of two alcohols and methanol in a reaction with
PC13:

Byproducts appearing in small quantities in the reaction between phosphorus tri—
chloride and alcohols include nonoalkylphosphite and phosphorous acid, formed as a

result of the reaction between dialkyphosphite and hydrogen chloride.

Dialkyphosphites can be produced from Pol; and alcohols by both cyclic and continuous
processes (18).

lower dialkylphosphites may be purified by distillation in a vacuum using a contin-
uous-action film evaporator at a residual pressure of 1-5 In Hg.

Trialkyphosphites may be industrially obtained by reacting phosphorus trichloride
and alcohols in the presence of hydrogen chloride acceptors (22-24) (as-oniun,
amniate .(23) and tertiary amines (24)) and by an ester interchange reaction per-
formed with triarylphosphites and alcohols (25). The latter reaction proceeds in
the presence of alkaline catalysts at high temperature.

Figure 16 shows the basic flowchart for production of trinsthylphosphite out of
methanol and triphenylphosphite (25).

The purity of triusthylphosphite obtained by this mstliod is 98 percent, and its
yield is 80-85 percent. This yield is achieved after several recyclings of triphenyl-
phosphite.

Another interesting method of obtaining trialkyphosphites is to react alcohols with
trianinophosphines :

The oldest method is to react phosphorus trichioride with sodium or magnesium alco-
holates, but the trialkylphosphite yields do not exceed 61 percent of theoretical.

pialkylthiophosphites may be obtained by reacting hydrogen sulfide with trialkyl-
phosphites in the presence of organic bases (26), and trialkyltrithiophosphites can
be obtained from asrcaptans and trialkyphosphites in the presence of zinc or cadmium
acetates (27). However, the best industrial method of. obtaining trialkytrithiophos-
phites is to react phosphorus trichloride with nercaptans. In this reaction, equi-
nolar quantities of these substances are heated. This is the way the preparation
nerfos is obtained industrially:

Tributyltrithiophosphite (mertos, toleks) is a light oily liquid with a boiling point

of 150-152-c at 2 m Hg. It is almost insoluble in water, and it is freely soluble
in organic solvents.

Its 1.050 in rats is 350 mg/kg.

The preparation is used to defoliate cotton in the form of aqueous emulsions at con—
sunption norms of 1-2 kg/ha. In terms of the speed of its action and the resulting
effect, mertos is one of the best detoliants.

Merros is slowly oxidized by atmospheric oxygen to tributyltrithiophosphate; this
reaction goes faster in the presence of heat, and it may be used as an intermediate
step in acquisition of tributyltrithiophosphate and in production or S.S,s-tributyl—
trithiophosphate in industry. Tributyltrithiophosphate enjoys extensive use as a
defoliant of cotton and other crops. It is marketed as butifos and DEF. It is an

oily liquid with an unpleasant odor; its boiling point is 150°C at 0.3 m Hg; its
L050 in experimental animals is 170-250 lag/kg.

Impurities contained in the technical-grade preparation include a small quantity
(up to 10 percent) of tributyltrithiophosphite and dibutyldisulfide. It is used as
oil solutions or emulsion concentrates at consmption norms of 1-1.5 kg/ha.

Some homologues of marine and butifos have been proposed as detoliants, but they have
not as yet enjoyed practical application.

Because mertos and butifos are readily oxidized by various oxidants, they may be

neutralized by oxidizing and chlorinating them with calcium and alkali metal hypo-
chlorites. However, it should be kept in mind that in a number of cases hypochlorites

react with these defoliants very violently, with ignition occurring.

Phosphoric Acid ﬁerivatives

As we proceed from phosphites to phosphates, the insecticidal and acaricidal activity
of the compound rises. Mixed esters of phosphoric acid, where one of the ester
radicals is acidic, are especially active. The higher the dissociation constant of
such an alcohol or phenol (or acid), the more toxic the compound is to insects and
animals. Thus for example, in the series o,O-diethyl-o-e-chlorophenylphosphate,
0,0-diethyl-o-2,4-dichlorophenylphosphate and 0,0-diethyl-o-2,4,5—trichlorophanyl-
phosphate, the last ester exhibits the greatest insecticidal activity (the dissocia-
tion constantsof 4-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,6,5-trichlorophenol are
«mom-1°, 3.1-10--'3 and 4.26-10-5). Dialkylt'luorophosphates as well as fluorophos-
phoric acid amides are highly toxic. However, when the length of alkyl radicals

in phosphoric acid esters and amides is increased, toxicity to animals decreases.

Maximum toxicity for many mixed esters of phosphoric acid is achieved with diethyl
derivatives, but exceptions are observed as well. As a rule dimethylphosphates are

significantly less toxic, apparently due to their high alkylating capacity in relation
to various nitrogen and sulfur compounds present in biological substrates, and their
high rate of hydrolysis.

Not only the nature of the substituent in the aromatic radical but also its position
has a great influence on the toxicity of mixed phosphate to insects and ticks. Insecti-
cidal properties are increased the most when nitro- and methylmercapto groups are
introduced into the aromatic radical. In general the activity of arylphosphate with
substituents at position 4 is higher than that of arylphosphates with the substituents
at positions 2 and 3.

Systematic study of the biological activity of different nixed aliphatic-aromatic phos-
phates showed that some of them may be of practical interest as insecticides (28-30),
fungicides (31) and herbicides (33). In particular, herbicidal action is exhibited

by tris-(butyoxyethyl)-phosphate (34).
High biological activity is exhibited by some phosphates obtained from oximes of
benzaldehyde and acetOphenone derivatives (35) containing different substituents in

the aromatic ring. Cyclic ester XIII, obtained from phosphorus chloroxide and hexa-
chlorophene, has herbicidal action (36):

are good insecticides with moderate toxicity to honeothernic animals. An example is

preparation dauks-zl'l (c,O-dinethyl-O-(3,5,6-trichloropyridyl)-phosphate). Its L053
in rats is 869 tug/kg (42,43).

Among nixed esters of phosphoric acid, various enol phosphates have been subjected
to the deepest study in recent years; many of them have achieved extensive practical
application in agriculture and in the control of synanthropic insects. Table 44
shows some phosphoric acid esters that have achieved some sort of application in
agriculture.

As we can see from Table 44 vinylphosphates containing various substituents in the
vinyl group have enjoyed the widest use. Perkov's reaction (47) is a general method

or obtaining o,o-dialkyl-o-vinylphosphate--interaction of a-halocarbonyl compounds '

Hmong the pesticides shown in Table 44, dichlorophos, phosphanidon, bidrin, gardens
and ruelene have enjoyed the widest use. 'meir properties will be described in
greater detail below.

0,0-Dimethyl-o-(2,2-dichlorovinyl) -phosphate (dichlorophos) is a colorless liquid
with a boiling point of 35°C at 0.05 an Hg, 53°C at 0.2 m Hg and 74°C at i an Hg.
Vapor pressure at 20°C is 1.2-10-2, at 30°C it is 3.0-10--2 and at 40°C it is 7.0-10-2
m 39. volatility is 145 lag/m3 at 20’C. 350 tug/.3 at 30°C and 900 39/013 at 40°C;

d£° 1.420, n30 1.4541 (see also ml. 44). It is readily soluble in nor: organic

solvents. At 20'c, 50 percent of dichlorophos hydrolyzes in 61.5 days, while at
70'C 50 percent hydrolyzes in 25 minutes. Hydrolysis proceeds faster in acid or
alkaline media.

Hydrolysis proceeds as follows:

Next the acid ester is hydrolyzed to phosphoric acid. A similar reaction also pro-

'mo methods of. obtaining dichlorophos are described in the literature.

1. Splitting off hydrogen chloride from chlorotos in aqueous solution by the action
of alkali (51,53):

(CH.O).PCHCCI. + KOH —b (CH.O).POCH-CCI. + KCI + ",0

It is best to perform the reaction in a biphasal system (water and an imiscible
organic solvent) in such a way that dichlorophos would be continually removed as

it is formed; in this case the dichlorophos yield may reach 80-85 percent of theo-
retical. Following distillation in a vacum, the concentration or the target sub-

stance reaches 93-97 percent, depending on the purity of the initial chlorofos.

2. The second method is based on reacting chloral with trimethylphosphite (52):

\

(CH.O);P + CChCHO —> (CH.O),POCﬂ-CCI. + CH,CI

When the reaction is performed in a low vacuum and a teaperature or about 40°C, the
dichlorophos yield exceeds 99 percent.

the maximum permissible concentration or dichlorophos in air has been set at 0.2 mtg/m3
(54).

When traces of moisture are present in stored dichlorophos, the latter decomposes
to release acid products that catalyze the further decomposition of the preparation.
In order to stabilize the technical-grade product, small quantities of epichloro-
hydrin (2-4 percent) are added to it to bind the acid substances and improve the

storage conditions. It would be best to store the preparation in glass or metallic
enameled containers.

'Symetrical honologues of dichlorophos are significantly less toxic to insects. The
following have recently been proposed as insecticides: 0,0-dinethyl-o-(2-chloro-2-
-fluorovinyl)-phosphate (60), O-Iethyl-O-butyl-O- (2, 2-dichlorovinyl)-phosphate (61),
0-(2 '-brouoethyl)-o-alkyl-O-2, 2-dichlorovinyl)-phoephate (62) and some others (63).

0,0—Dinethyl-o- [l-methyl-2-chloro-2- (N,N-diethylcarbasoyl) -vinyl] -phosphate (phos-
phanidon) is a colorless liquid freely soluble in water, alcohol and acetone, and
poorly soluble in saturated hydrocarbons: its boiling point is NW: at 0.01 m 89,

its vapor pressure at 20'c is 2.5 10'5 III Hg, and its volatility is 0.41 lug/n3

Phosphamidon is resistant to neutral and weakly acid aqueous solutions, while it
undergoes hydrolysis quickly in an alkaline medium

Despite the relatively high toxicity of phosphanidon to animals, it is used as a
systemic insecticide to control sucking pests of cotton and other crops. It is

also effective against some gnawing pests (for example the Colorado beetle).

The best way to obtain phosphanidon is to react trinethylphosphite with dichloro-
acetoacetic acid diethylanide:

Chlorination may also be performed by chlorine in the presence of urea in a water
or water-alcohol medium (66).

0.0-Dimethyl-O-[l-methyl-Z-(N,N-dimethylcarbamoyl)-vinyl]-phosphate (bidrin) is an
active systemic insecticide. It is a liquid that mixes with water at all dilution
ratios; di§ 1.22 (see also Table 44).

At pH 9 and at 37°C, 50 percent of the preparation hydrolyzes in 50 days, while at '
pa 1 the same amount hydrolyzes in 100 days.

Bidrin is recommended against various plant pests at consumption norms from 0.25 to
l kg/ha, and against some gnawing plant pests.

The metabolism or this compound in plant and animal organisms proceeds similarly as
with metabolism of phosphamidon (67,68).

Bidrin is synthesized by Perkov's reaction out of monochloroacetoacetic acid dimethyl-

When these compounds are fed to insects. they do not produce nor-a1 progeny. These
compounds should be used to control only those species of insects which produce large
populations within a single season.

These compounds are toxic and dangerous to vertebrate animals and man. for which
reason their use is very limited for the moment, and they have essentially not gone
beyond the stage of production experiments.

‘miophosphoric Acid Derivatives

Substitution of one or the oxygen atom by sulfur in phosphoric acid derivatives
causes a significant decrease in the coqound's toxicity to manuals without signi-
ficantly changing its insecticidal and acaricidal activity, though there are excep-
tions to this general rule. In this connection derivatives or thiophosphoric acid
are broadly employed in agriculture to control plant pests.

Mixed esteramides of thiophosphoric acid (VIII and IX) are also usedas pesticides,
but these groups contain fewer representatives. Mixed esters of thiophosphoric
acid with general formula x have recently cone into use against plant diseases.

A large nuber of coepounds containing the most varied substituents in the armtic
radical, to include one halogen atom in the ortho, mtha and pom positions, two
halogen atoea in different positions and three halogen atoms, have wen described
among mixed esters of thiophosphoric acid with general formula Ill. Among the
trihaloaryl-O,o-dialkylthiophosphates, those offering the greatest interest include
2,5-dichloroéd-brooophenyl- (94), 2,4odibromo-S-chlor0phenyl- (92,93), 2,5-dichloro-
-4-iodopheny1' (95-97) and haloa1ky1pheny1-0,0—dia1kylthiophosphates (98). Esters
nave also been described containing, in the aromatic radical, nitro (99.105) , cyan
(106), acyl (107-111), dialkylaainomethyl (112), carbalkoxyl (113), thiocarbamido
(114), carbamoylanido (115), trifluorouethyl (116), alkylsulfide (117-123), sulfanide
(124-127) and sulfon groups (128-130). In addition mined esters of thiophosphoric
acid made from bis-phenols containing a sulfide and a disulfide group have been de—
scribed (131-135). The following generalizations may be made about this series.

1. The strongest insecticides and acaricides are nixed esters of thiophosphoric

acid in which R and R' are lower aliphatic radicals with the nunber of carbon atoms
tetaling not more than four: in this case compounds containing two ethyl radicals

or one methyl and one ethyl radical exhibit maximum activity. 0,0-dimsthyl-o-aryl
esters of thiophosphoric acid are minimally toxic to uaasnals.

2. Mixed aliphatic-aromatic esters of thiophosphoric acid not containing functional
groups in the aromatic radical exhibit low insecticidal activity.

3. Among substituted 0,0-dialkyl—o-aryl esters of thiOphosphoric acid, esters con—
taining a nitro group at position 4 in the aromatic ring have maximum insecticidal
activity. Esters containing a cyan, sulfide, sulfoxide or a sulfon group at position
4 exhibit rather high activity. however, most insecticidal comunds of this series
are also relatively highly toxic to canals. Coupounds with other substituents are
less effective. The corresponding 2- and 3-substituted compounds have weaker in-
secticidal action.

129

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

4. Introduction of a second substituent in the aromatic radical sameuhat reduces
the compound's toxicity to manuals without significantly reducing its insecticidal
activity. In this case the position of the substituents has a great influence.
mus-introduction of an alkyl group or a halogen atom at position 3 of an initial
4-nitro- or 4-methy1thiophenol decreases toxicity to vertebrates and does not
reduce the insecticidal activity of the compound, while introduction of these

substituents at position 2 reduces the biological activity of the preparations
in all respects.

Compounds also exhibit satisfactory insecticidal activity when they contain sub-
stituents in positions 2, 4, 5: for example 0,0-dimethy1-0-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl)-
~thiophosphate and 0,0-dimethyl-0-(2,5-dichloro-4-bromophenyl)-thiophosphate, the
toxicity of these compounds to nan-tale being negligible.

5. Presence of more than three substituents in the aromatic radical reduces the
compound's insecticidal activity; sometimes the preparation's nature of action
changes as well. Thus 0.0-dialkyl-o-2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorophenyl)-thiophosphates
exhibit fungicidal activity, though not strongly enough for practical use.

7. As we proceed from compounds with the general formula III to wounds with
formula VIII, in many cases the insecticidal activity persists (136-139) , but this
group's fungicidal activity is significantly higher, and some alkylamido-o-alkyl-o-
-(2-nitroary1)-thiophosphates have been proposed for practical use as herbicides
(140,141). Haloarylamidothiophosphates, the preparation tsitron being an example,
have herbicidal properties.

8. o,o-dia1ky1-s-arylthiophosphates in many cases have not only insecticidal but
also fungicidal action (142-144). However, their toxicity to homeothermic animals

is higher than that of the corresponding thionphosphates.

9. 0,0-dialkyl-O-ary1cyanoxime thiophosphates (145—148) have high insecticidal
activity. The new insecticide foksim (145) is an example of such compounds. Some
compounds of this type also have fungicidal action (148).

Some phosphorylated (at the N) N-mthyl-O-arylcarbamates also have selective toxicity
(149) .

10. o,o-dialkyl-s-benzylthiophosphates, both simple and containing various sub-
stituents in the aromatic radical, have high fungicidal activity (150-162). Similar

properties are also possessed by O-alkylalkylamido-s-bensothiophosphates and their
honologues (152,155,156) and 0,0-dialkyl-s-arylthioalkylthiopMsphates (160).

ll. o—Alkyl-O-ary1-N-alky1amidothiophosphates (163) have noticeable fungicidal
activity.

12. The pesticidal activity of diaryl-O-alkylthiophosphates and triarylthiophos-
phates is significantly lower than that of o-o-dialkyl-o-aryl-thiophosphate, though
there are indications in the literature that triarylthiophosphates do have pesti-
cidal activity (164). Some alkyldiarylthiophosphates have been proposed as
aoocides (165).

130

FOIOFHCIALUSEONLY
13. wolic thiophosphates obtained tron salicyl alcohol (166-170) and pyrocatechol

14. There are indications that compounds with general foraula XI have neaatocidal
action (172):

exhibit high insecticidal activity but are rather toxic to honeothernic animals
(173-175). ‘

16. In most cases substitution of an aromatic radical by a heterocyclic radical
also produces active insecticides, examples of which would be diazinon, dursban,
tsinofox, azuntol. sayfos and others. Mixed esters and esteranidea containing the
most diverse heterocyclic radicals have been studied. to include nixed esters of
thiophosphoric acid and derivatives of thiophene (176), pyridine (177-183) .
quinoline (184), inidasole (185). benziaidasole (186.187), thiasole (188), pyri-

dazinone (189-191), oxycounarin (192-193), triasole (194-196), pyrimidine (197-207) .
‘benzomine (208,213), bensotriazine (214-216). benzofurazan (217,218), 1,3,4-thia-
diazole (219), benzothiadiazole (220), dithiane (221,222), quinoxaline (223-228)
'and others (229,230). Most nitrogenous heterocycl‘ic compounds have not only in-
secticidal but also fungicidal action, though just a few substances in this class
have achieved practical use as fungicides thus far.

17. Among the honologues of the o,O—dialkyl-o-arylthiophosphates, methyl esters
'have the least toxicity in relation to houeothermic animals. owing to their high

alkylating capacity, as a consequence of which they break down faster in the bodies
‘of homeotheuic animals. This is true for practically all series of mixed esters
'of the acids of phosphorus; in this case nixed esters of dithiophosphoric acid
‘have a higher alkylating capacity, and owing to this they are even less toxic to
honeotheraic animals. Thiol isomers have a lower alkylating capacity, and are more
‘toxic.

Some preparations in this class which have achieved practical use are given in
’l‘able 45.

The following general dependencies between activity and structure are observed
for compounds with general formulas V and VI:

1. when the total nuaber of carbon atoms in R and R' is more than four. the co.-
pound's insecticidal activity decreases.

2. When the nuaber of methylene groups between phosphorus and sulfur atoms is
here than four, the compound's activity declines sharply. Maxim.- activity is

seen in compounds containing one or two methylene groups.

3. oxidation of sulfur in a carbon radical to a sulfoxide group or formation of

a sulfoniun coapound increases the ccnpound's toxicity, especially in the latter
case.

4. Introduction of different substituents into R" also sometimes produces active
compounds (231,232).

5. Practically all preparations with structure v and VI have systemic action,
with the contact action of thion isomers being somewhat weaker than that of thiol
isomers.

6. substitution of sulfur by nitrogen results in ccupounds toxic to both insects
and ticks on one hand and mammals on the other.

7. Increasing the hunter of carbon atoms in R" to more than three reduces the
compound's insecticidal activity.

8. Compounds in which R" is represented by aromatic radicals exhibit lower insecti-
cidal activity than do compounds of the aliphatic series. ,

9. Introduction of hydrocarbon radicals into an ethylene radical also produces
active compounds (233).

10. Substitution of sulfide sulfur by oxygen as a rule raises the compound’s

phytocidal activity. especially if an aromatic residue is bound to the oxygen
(234-236).

ll. o,S-dialkylanidothiophosphates (237-242) also have high insecticidal
activity: however, these compounds are rather highly toxic to homeothermic animals.

When the amide group is acylated by carboxylic acids the ccmpound‘s toxicity to
animals decreases significantly (242). Acylated dialkylhydrazidothiophosphates also
have pesticidal activity (243).

12. Diamidoalkylthiophosphates, triamidothiophosphates and mixed alkyldiamidothio-
phosphates have a broad spectrum of pesticidal activity. Fungicides (163) . nemato-
cides (244), sexual sterilizers (245) and herbicides (246) have been found among
these groups of cospounds.

o.0-Dialkyl-s-thiocyanatomethylthiophosphates are also active pesticides (247).

13. 0.0-Dialkyl-s-vinylthiophosphates and 0,0-dialchl-S-vinylthiophosphates with
various substituents in the vinyl radical are also active insecticides (248-253).

14. Mixed esters of thiophosphoric acid containing a carbalkoxyl and a carbamoyl
grow in one of the hydrocarbon radicals have high insecticidal activity as well
(254-255). It should be noted. however, that the toxicity of this type of compounds
ishigher in most cases than that of the comsponding dithiophosphates.

Compounds which have come into practical use are shown in Table 46.

The reaction between PSC13 and alcohols proceeds readily in response to slight
heating, and the alkyldichlorothiophosphate yield is not less than 90 percent of

theoretical. Alkyldichlorothiophosphates are allowed to react with alcohols at tem-
peratures from -5 to 0°C while stirring vigorously. Both tertiary amines and caustic
alkali can be used to bind hydrogen chloride, and when dimethylchlorothiophosphate

is the target substance. 40 percent aqueous sodium hydroxide solution can be used.
Mined dialkylchlorothiophosphates in which a methyl group is one of the ester radicals
form with a yield close to 90 percent.

High yields of dialkylchlorothiophosphates are also obtained by reacting alkyldi-
chlorothiophosphates with sodium or magnesia alcoholates:

The optimum tesperature for a reaction with sodium alcoholate is irom ~10 to -lS°c.
At higher tenperatures the yield decreases and a significant quantity of trialkyl-
thiophosphates forms. Synthesis of dialkylchlorothiophosphates from magnesium alcoo
holates is relatively single, and it proceeds at higher temperature.

A good method of obtaining dialkylchlorothiophosphates is chlorination of dialkyl-
dithiophosphoric acids (257) or bis-(dialkylthiophosphone)-disul£ides:

In the presence or excess chlorine, sulfur chloride is obtained as a byproduct.

Chlorination may be carried out not only with chlorine but also with various chlori-
nating agents, to include phosphorus pentachloride, sulfur chloride and dichloride.

sulfuryl chloride and other similar compounds. The reaction is carried out at lower
tauperatures, both with and without various organic solvents. It would be convenient
to perform the reaction with chlorine, and then remove sulfur chloride by treating
the product with 325. In this case sulfur chloride transforms into elemental sulfur,
which is easily separated from dialkylcblorothiophosphate by simple filtration. The

yield of dialkylchlorothiophosphate in this method is about 90 percent: the concen-
tration of the target product is more than 90 percent (269).

This is a convenient method for obtaining dialkylchlorothiophosphates with identical
hydrocarbon radicals; if dialkylchlorothiophosphates with different radicals are
required, it would be better to use the reaction with Psclg, described above. In
turn, Psc13 can be obtained industrially at a quantitative yield by passing PCl3

vapor through melted sulfur to which alkali metal polysulfides are added as catalysts
(258).

A flowchart for production of psc13 is shown in Figure 17 (258).

Aryldichlorothiophosphates are formed with prolonged heating (not less than 10 hours)
at llO-llS°C together with the appropriate phenol and excess PSCl3, in the presence

the reaction ends, excess Pscl3 is distilled away in a water bath in a vacuum, and

the aryldichlorothiophosphate is subjected to further processing (260).
To obtain dialkylarylthiophosphates, aryldichlorothiophosphate is reacted with the
alcoholates of the appropriate alcohols. Alcohol can also be used in the presence

zit a hydrogen chloride acceptor, but in this case the yield of dialkylarylthio-
phosphates is lower.

This reaction proceeds readily with most dialkylthiophosphates. with dimethylthio-

Some of the most ilportant derivatives of thiophosphoric acid are described in
greater detail below.

0,0-Dimethyl-O-(4-nitrophenyl)-thiophosphate (metaphos) is a white crystalline
substance; its vapor pressure at 20'C is 0.9‘7'10’s II llg: its volatility is 0.14
mg/m33 a?,° 1.358: n55 1.5515. n is poorly soluble in paraffin hydrocarbons and
readily soluble in aromatic hydrocarbons and in nest organic solvents (see also
'i‘able 45).

The rate of hydrolysis of netaphos is significantly higher than that of thiophos;
At 20°C and pH 1-5, 50 percent of the preparation hydrolyzes in 175 days, while at

70°C it takes ll hours. The rate of hydrolysis in an alkaline medium is even
greater.

Relatively speaking, metaphos is thermally unstable, and when heated to bio-160°C
it transforms almost coupletely into the corresponding thiol isomer; sometime an
explosion occurs, and a porous mass containing a large quantity of carbon terns:

This reaction also proceeds when an alcohol solution of metaphos is heated tor a
long period of time at lOO'C. The products of thermal decomposition of metaphos
have also found to include trimethylsulfonium salts. obtained as a result of

methylation of dimethylsulride; the latter possibly forms from O-methyl-S-methyl-O,4-
~nitrophenylthiophosphate. Metaphos is a strong alkylating agent and is capable of
methylating sulfides, amims, phosphines, thiourea, and many other compounds:

The high methylating capability of metaphos is possibly a cause of its lower toxicity
to manuals, since part of the preparation is broken down by denethylation prior to
reaching the reactive centers of cholinesterase (261).

in all other chemical properties metaphos is similar to thiophos.

The toxicity of metaphos to homeotherms is significantly lower (1.050 25-50 mg/kg):
in comparison with thiophos it does not penetrate through skin as easily, which makes

work with it less difficult. ‘lhe maxim- permissible concentration of netaphos in
air is 0.1 lug/ma.

Fletaphos is marketed as emulsions, wettable powders and dusts. - When'selecting fillers

for dusts and wettable powders, it should be kept in mind that even weakly alkaline
fillers are ill-suited, since aetaphos (and thiophos as well) breaks'down relatively
Quickly in these filters and loses its insecticidal properties.

The preparation is used against a broad range of plant pests, similarly as with thio-
phos. Because it is less toxic to manuals, metaphos is gradually supplanting thio-
phos. World production of netaphos is higher than thiophos production, and it is
exhibiting a tendency toward further growth.

Metaphos may be synthesized by all of the methods described above for obtaining
mixed aliphatic-aromatic esters of thiophosphoric acid. 'lhe most important in-
dustrial method of obtaining metaphos is to react dimethylchlorothiophosphate with
p—nitrophenol in the presence of hydrogen chloride acceptors or with sodium p-nitro-
phenylate; the reaction is performed in water in the presence of emulsifiers (for
exanple ammonium naphthenate or amines) and in organic solvents. chlorobenzene,
xylol or aliphatic ketones (acetone and methylethylketone) are used most often.

When the reaction is carried out in organic solvents, the solvent must subsequently
be distilled away, which must be done at the lowest possible temperature in continu-
ous-action film evaporators. Otherwise the metaphor may break down, sometimes even
with an explosion.

Preparation containing up to 96~96 percent 0,0-dimethyl-o-(4-nitrophenyl)-thiophos-
phate is obtained by reacting dimethylchlorothiophosphate with p-nitrophenol in the
presence of anhydrous potash in acetone, using sufficiently pure initial products.
For convenience of handling and transportation, this product is diluted with 10-15

percent xylol.

when the reaction is performed in an aqueous medium, the resulting preparation con-y
tains 85-90 percent target substance. With different methods, the metaphos yields
vary within 75-90 percent of theoretical.

In addition preparations obtained in organic solvents also contain o,s-dimethyl-o-
-(4-nitrophenyl)-thiophosphate as an impurity.

the insecticidal properties of all metaphos isomers have been studied, to include

the (+) and (-) forms of O,s-dimethyl-o-(d-nitrophenyl)-thiophosphates, of which the
left isomer has been found to be more toxic to animals (1.050 in rats is 25 mg/kg,
while the toxicity of the right isomer is 135 ng/kg). Of the three thiophosphates
with sulfur in different positions, the most toxic is 0,0-dimethyl-s-(4-nitrophenyl)-
-thiophosphate (the 1.050 in mice is 7.5 tag/kg).

0,0-Dimethy1-O- (denitro-Ii-methylphenyl) -thiophosphate (metilnitrotos) is 6a light-

colored liquid with unpleasant odor; its vapor pressure at 20‘ is 6. 0.10”6 lllll Hg;

i volatility is 0.09 lag/m3: its viscosity at 30°C is 20. 8 centipoise; (12° 1.308;

with methyl and ethyl alcohols, alkylacetates (262,263), ketones and aromatic hydro-

carbons. Its solubility is about 4 percent in kerosene and about 7 percent in

petroleum ether (see also Table 45).

Its [.050 in various experimental animals is within l42-l,000 mg/kg. Its nature or
action upon animals is similar to that of metaphos.

Hetilnitrofos is practially indistinguishable from metaphos in its chemical proper-
ties, but its rate of hydrolysis by water and alkali8 is somewhat lover. Thus it

takes 5 minutes for 50 percent of metaphos to be hydrolyzed in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide
3014310“ “30°C, while netilnitrofos takes 12 minutes.

This preparation's thermal stability is also not very high, and when heated above
lOO'C it undergoes Pishchemnta isomerization and may explode as it decomposes. In

this connection overheating of the preparation should be avoided, both during its
production and during storage. The preparation must be stored in enamel, aluminum

or glass containers. Iron promotes this preparation's deconvosition, as-is true with
most other organophosphorus compounds.

species. Bromofos is a mildly toxic preparation: Its 1.050 to various animal species

Bromofos may be synthesized by all of the methods described for ronnel. The greatest
difficulty lies in making 2,5-dichloro-4-bromophenol which apparently would best be
obtained by bromination of 2,5-dichlorophenol. In turn, 2,5-dichlorophenol can be
formed by saponification of 1,2,4-trichlorobensene by sodium hydroxide in methanol at
l60-l90'c under pressure. In this case a mixture of 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenols is
produced, which is then separated by fractional precipitation out of alkaline solu-

tions, since the two compounds have different dissociation constants, or they may be
separated by complexing with urea (270,271).

Bromofos has been proposed for use against the most diverse species of insect pests,

basic directions: hydrolysis and oxidation. Depending on the structure and reactivity
of the initial substance, either hydrolysis or oxidation occurs first, but in some
cases these processes occur simultaneously (27S). Hydrolysis may occur at the

P-OAr bond (or at the oxygen atom bound to the heterocycle) or at the P-OAlk bond:

as a rule the rate of hydrolysis is somewhat higher in the first case than in the
second; however, in some cases these reactions proceed concurrently, though at
different rates. Oxidation occurs first at the thion sulfur. If sulfide sulfur is
present in the ester molecule, sulfoxides and sulfones form, after which the mole-
cule undergoes destruction. Aromatic and heterocyclic residues may enter into a
reaction with carbohydrates to form the appropriate glucuronates.

However, in many cases the organophosphorus compound may decompose all the way down
to the simplest products. his is What happens, for example, in photochemical de-

composition of one of the most persistent organophosphorus insecticides--dursban

nixed aliphatic esters of thiophosphoric acid are of significant interest as systemic
insecticides. among which mercaptophos, methyl-mercaptophos and its sulfoxide and
sulfone, and vamidotion have enjoyed rather broad application. Due to the high
toxicity of msrcaptophos to animals, its use has recently decreased significantly,
while the other preparations are enjoying rather broad use.

Methyl-mercaptophos is a methyl hoologue of mercaptophos. technical-grade methyl-
msrcaptophos is a mixture of the thiol (30 percent) and thion (70 percent) isomers
of 0,o-dimethyl~2-ethylmercaptoethylthiophosphate.

'l'he thion isomer of methyl-mercaptophos is a liquid with a characteristic unpleasant
odor: its vapor pressure at 20' is 1.85'10‘5 n 89; its volatility is 23.3 mtg/:3:
c130 1.1904. n. is freely soluble in most organic solvents (see also Table 46).

The thiol isomer of msthyl-mercaptophos is a li d; its vapor pressure at 20'c is
3.6-10-“ mm Hg; its volatility is 4.5 sag/ma; d& 1.207. It is freely soluble in
organic solvents (see also Table 46).

The chemical stability of methyl-mercaptophos is lower than that of mercaptophos.
Thus for example methyl-mercaptophos is saponifisd at pa 3 and 70'C in 4.9 hours,
while eercaptophos takes 10 hours; the difference is even more significant in an
alkaline medime.

lugrouping of the thion isomer into the thiol isomer also proceeds faster. While it
takes 91 days for the thion isomer of mercaptophos to transform at 40'C into a
mixture containing 90 percent thion and 10 percent thiol isomer, the thion isomer of

methyl-mercaptophos undergoes 10 percent isomerization under the same conditions in
8 days.

In the presence of traces of water, msthyl-mercaptophos may enter into an inter-
molecular methylation reaction:

which in a nusber of cases is a reason for the product's spoilage during long-term
storage. Metallic iron and some of its compounds have a negative influence on the
stability of methyl-mercaptophos, for which reason storage of this preparation in
iron containers is not recommended. It would be best of all to store methyl-
mercaptophos in enameled containers or in containers made from pure aluminum.

nethyl-mercaptophos is less toxic than mercaptophos. The L050 of the technical-

grade preparation is within 80-100 mg/kg. The 1.050 of the thion isomer is 180
mg/kg, while that of thiol isomer is 40 mg/kg. The maximum permissible concentra-

tion in air is 0.1 lug/m3.

The metabolism of methyl-mercaptophos in plants and insects proceeds similarly as

with mercaptophos, except that when methyl-mercaptophos enters into plants, it

quickly undergoes isomerization into the thiol isomer. which then undergoes metabolism
similarly as with mercaptophos. The oxidation products or the thion isomer of
asthyl-nercaptophos have not been observed, but they have been obtained syntheti-
tally.

exhibit high activity not only against sucking plant posts but also against gnawing
insects.

The following laws governing the dependence between biological activity and struc-
ture can be stated for the series of compounds with general formula XII:

1. All dithiophosphoric acid derivatives with this structure are less toxic to

vertebrates than are the corresponding derivatives of thiophosphoric and phosphoric
acids.

2. Mixed esters in which R and R’ are methyl radicals are least toxic to vertebrates.
An increase in the nunber of carbon atoms in these radicals increases the toxicity of
the compounds to vertebrates without increasing their insecticidal activity.

Change in R"' has a less significant influence on the toxicity of mixed dithiophos-
phates to vertebrates, but it has a significant effect on insecticidal and acaricidal

properties. Comounds in which R'" is an aromatic residue exhibit the highest
activity.

Introduction of a carbalkoxyl group into R'" greatly reduces the conpound's toxicity
to vertebrates and has almost no effect on insecticidal and acaricidal properties.
This is valid for aliphatic derivatives, but not aromatic derivatives.

The great ditrerence in the toxicity of this. group of mixed esters of dithiophos-
phoric acid to insects and vertebrates can be explained by differences in the path-
ways by which the preparations are metabolized in animals. Thus for example, in

the insect body carbofos transforas into a more-toxic ester of thiophosphoric acid--
0.0-dimethyl-s-(1,2-dicarbethoxyethyl)-thiophosphate, while in homeothermic aniaals
the ester residue undergoes saponification (at the carboxyl group) to produce a com-
pound that is practically nontoxic to animals (2,291) :

Compounds with general formula XIII usually have not only contact but also systemic
insecticidal action. ‘

Coupounds with general forsula XIII in which R-R' 80!; exhibit high insecticidal
activity and moderate toxicity to manuals. Substitution of just one methyl group

by an ethyl or other group containing a large number of carbon atoms sharply in-
creases the compound's toxicity to manuals without signiﬁcantly changing its insecti-
cidal activity. Thus for exanple, the Lbso of 0.0-dimethyl-S-(N-methylcarbanoyl-
nethyl)-dithiophosphate in rats is 250 mg/kg, while that o: O-methyl-o-ethyl-s-(N-
-methylcarbamoylnethyl)~dithiophosphate is 12 mg/kg.

Substitution of the methyl radical in the amide group by an ethyl radical does not
significantly change the compound's toxicity to homeothermic animals. but enlarging
the nunber or carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon radical at the nitrogen atom reduces
the cowound's insecticidal activity. Substitution of the second hydrogen atom at
the nitrogen atom by hydrocarbon radicals also reduces the preparation's insectici-
dal activity. when this hydrogen atom is substituted by a carbalkoxyl or formyl
residue. the compound's activity against insects does not decrease, but its toxicity

to manuals grows significantly. however, there are exceptions to this general rule
(297,298).

Addition of a carboxyl or a carbamoyl group to the hydrocarbon radical at the nitro-
gen atom produces acaricides and insecticides with highly selective action that
are moderately toxic to homeothenaic animals (292,293). Compounds obtained by join-
ing dialkyldithiophosphoric acids to esters of cysteine (296) and acylated unsatu-
rated amino acids also possess insecticidal properties.

Insecticidal properties also persist when halogen atoms (299), alkyl- and acylamino
groups (300). cyano (301.302) and phenyl and carbalkoxy groups (303) are added to

the hydrocarbon residue at the nitrogen atom. Substitution of hydrogen at the

alkoxy groups (309,310) produces substances with sufficiently high acaricidal and
insecticidal activity. In the last case, however, phytocidal activity rises somewhat.
Pbytocidal activity increases especially strongly when one of the alkoxyls at the
phosphorus atom is substituted by an aryloxy residue (311). The resulting mixed

dithiophosphates have herbicidal action. When an aside group is substituted by a
nitrogenous heterocyclic residue. herbicides form as well (312,313).

Mixed esters of ethylene glycol also have insecticidal action (314). o-Alkyl-N-alkyl-
(dialkyl)amido-s-Ndmethylcarbamoylmethyldithiophosphates have not only insecticidal
and acaricidal action but also fungicidal properties (315-317).

Compounds with general formula XIII enjoy rather broad use in agriculture as in-
secticides and acaricides.

Compounds with general formulas XIV and xv possess strong systemic acaricidal and
insecticidal action. The basic principles concerning the dependence of insecticidal

and acaricidal activity on the structure of these two groups of coupounds may be
stated as follows:

1. For compounds with general formla XIV, increasing the nuaber of carbon atoms to
more than two in all hydrocarbon radicals reduces toxicity to animals and to plant
pests. ‘Ihe most toxic compound is the ester in which R-R' -R"" -c235. Substitu-
tion of 11"" by an aromatic radical somewhat decreases toxicity to manuals while
maintaining acaricidal and insecticidal properties.

2. 01' compounds with general formula xv. those with R-R' =01; are the least toxic
to manuals. Substitution of one methyl radical by an ethyl or higher hydrocarbon
residue sharply increases toxicity and somewhat intensifies insecticidal properties.
When the total nunber of carbon atoms in the R and R' radicals increases over four,
compounds with relatively low insecticidal activity form.

3. When various functional groups are introduced at a", compounds with high insecti-
cidal and acaricidal activity form (318-32l,324). Mixed esters of dithiophosphoric

acid containing a carbalkoxyl or carbamide group at the mthylene bridge have the
highest activity (318-321).

4'. The appropriate sulfoxides and sulfones have high insecticidal and acaricidal
activity as well (322,323).

5. Compounds in which R" is a dialkyldithiophosphoric residue also have acaricidal
and insecticidal properties ‘(327-329).

5. Substitution of sulfide sulfur by oxygen bound to an aryl group leads in most
cases to higher phytocidal activity (330,331). Some coupounds of this type have
been proposed as herbicides.

7. As we proceed from derivatives of dithiophosphoric acid to derivatives of tri-and
tetrathiophosphoric acids. the insecticidal and acaricidal properties diminish while
fungicidal and phytocidal activity increases (316.317,332,333).

8. “the “1'50“ “Bid“! at the sulfide sulfur is substituted by a carbanic or di-
aleldithiocarbanic acid residue, the resulting substances have fungicidal proper-
ties (334).

suiting substances have varying pesticidal activity (335-347). Mixed dithiophos-
phates with carboxylic acid residues at the nitrogen arm have insecticidal and
acaricidal properties (335-339); alkylaszino derivatives also have similar properties
(347). If the acyl group is a residue of an aliphatic sulfonic acid residue (340-
342). the substance has insecticidal and acaricidal properties. But when an aromatic
sultonic acid residue is introduced, phytocidal activity rises and the substances
exhibit herbicidal action. here are indications that 0,0-dialkyl-S-hydrasonethyl-
dithiophosphates have not only insecticidal but also neuatocidal action (348).

Mixed dithiophosphates containing halogen atoms at one or their aliphatic radicals,
for example 0.0-dialkyl-s-(l,2,2-trihaloethyldithio)-phosphates and their honologues,

Though a very large nunber or various derivatives of dithiophosphoric acid with
heterocyclic substituents have now been described in the literature, it is still
impossible to deduce any sort or laws governing the dependence of the pesticidal
activity or the compounds on their structure.

Dithiophcsphoric acid derivatives that have achieved practical use against various
harmful organisms are shown in Table 47.

In some cases not only salts but also free acids can be used. In this case the
process is slower, and it requires a higher temperature:

The reaction between diphenyldisulfide and metallic sodium in the presence of
alkyldichlorophosphate may be used to obtain o-alkyl-s,s-diphenyldithiophosphates.

The dialkyldithiophosphoric acids required for synthesis of mixed dithiophosphates
can be obtained with a good yield by reacting phosphorus pentasulfide with alcohols:

P,S. + ‘ROH —e Has 4- athSH

Trialkyldithiophosphate is formed in small quantities as a byproduct.

The purity of the initial phosphorus pentasulfide is highly significant to synthesis
of dialkyldithiophosphoric acids, since impurities increase the amount of byproducts,
removal of which presents significant difficulties. Usually, phosphorus pentasulfide
is obtained directly by reacting equimolar quantities of sulfur and yellow phosphorus
at high temperature. when sufficiently pure initial substances are used, technical-
grade phosphorus pentasulfids does not require further purification. When P255 must

be purified, it is either crystallized out of carbon disulfide or it is subjected
to vacuum distillation.

The basic flowchart for producing dialkyldithiophosphoric acids out of phosphorus
pentasulfide and alcohol is shown in Figure 18 (420).

Most :ialkyldithiophosphates obtained by this method are sufficiently pure: however,
owing to its high alkylating capacity dimethyldithiophosphoric acid contains rather

sizeable quantities of trimethyldithiophosphate. Trimethyldithiophosphate may be
separated away either by distillation with live steam or by conversion of dimethyl-
dithiophosphoric acid into a sodium or other salt, followed by separation of

xylol etc.) . Free acid is separated by the action of table salt upon concentrated
sulfuric acid (421). This purification method can produce 95-100 percent dimethyl-
dithiophosphoric acid.

The resulting trimethyldithiophosphate may be used to make dimethylchlorothio-
phosphate:

Dimethylchlorothiophosphate contains, as an ilpurity, a certain quantity of iso-
meric 0-methyl-s-methylchlorothiophosphate.

The most inportant representatives of these types of compounds are presented below.

0,0-Dimethyl-s-(1.2-dicarbethoxyethyl)-dithiophosphate (carbozos, malathion) is a
colorless liquid; dﬁs 1.23, n35 1.4905; vapor pressure at 20°C is 1.25-10'“ m ﬁg:

volatility is 2.26 mg/m3. Carbotos is freely soluble in most organic solvents, with
the exception of saturated hydrocarbons (see also Table 47).

The L050 in various experimental animals is 500-l,500 mg/kg. The maximum permissible
concentration is air is 0.5 mg/m3.

When heated for a long period of time'at 150°C carbotos undergoes isomerization,
transforming into the appropriate thiol isomer:

At higher temperature this reaction proceeds violently,.and a significant part of
the product breaks down, sometimes even with an explosion. When impurities such as

trimethyldithiophosphate, dimethyldithiophosphoric acid and some others are present
in he preparation, intense decouposition of carbofos may occur even at lower tempera-

ture .

Hydrolysis of carbotoe in acid and alkali media proceeds in different ways. While in
an acid medium the main hydrolysis products are dimethyldithiophosphoric acid and
mercaptosuccinate, in alkaline medium dimethyldithiophosphoric acid salts and a
fumaric acid ester form:

The reaction is used for quantitative polarographic determination or carbotos.

when carbotos is oxidized by nitric acid or other strong oxidants, the thionic sulfur
atom splits on, and the corresponding thiolphosphoric ester forms:

Rhea allowed to remain' in prolonged contact with iron or materials containing iron,
carbotos breaks down and loses its insecticidal properties completely. In this

connection it cannot be stored in iron containers. It is preserved best in glass
containers.

The preparation is marketed as an emlsion concentrate containing 30-60 percent
active ingredient, an emulsifier and a solvent. Xylol is used as the solvent.

The preparation is made for ultralow volume spraying as a 90-96 percent concentrate
containing only an insigniﬁcant quantity of additives.

Carbotos can also be used in the form or dusts or suspensions obtained from wettable
powder. Usually carbofos is used in agriculture at a 0.2-0.25 percent concentration

(active ingredient). Residual quantities of carbofos have been established in the
USSR at not more than 8 mg/kg.

The main method of obtaining carbofos is to attach dimethyldithiophosphoric acid to
maleic acid ester. The reaction proceeds very readily in the presence of basic
catalysts, both in various organic solvents and without then:

This reaction may be combined with that of obtaining dimethyldithiophosphoric acid
from methaml and phosphorus pennsultide. This process is performed in a diethyl-
maleate medium. however sometimes the reaction (in the combined method) proceeds
so violently that the product undergoes spontaneous decomposition.

Technical-grade carbofos obtained by this method contains small quantities of
trimethyldithiophosphate, diethylmaleate and solvent. Xylol is usually used as
the solvent for carbofos synthesis. The carbofos yield with this reaction is more
than 80 percent of theoretical, but when condensation is combined with acquisition
of. dimethyldithiophosphoric acid, the yield is somewhat lower.

The basic flowchart of obtaining carbofos by this method is shown in Figure 19.

Volatile ilnpurities, including trimethyldithiophosphates, can be removed from carbo-
toe by distillation with live steam (422) . while excess dimethyldithiophosphoric
acid can be removed by washing with alkalis (423) or with sodium sulfide solution
(424). Unreacted diethylmaleate is hydrolyzed (423). The unpleasant odor is re-
moved by oxidizing the preparation with oxygen in the presence of heavy metals
(425), or cmyl hydl oxide is added (426-428). It should be noted that when carbofos
is allowed to stand for a long period of time. the unpleasant odor returns.

A large nmber of analogues and homologue: of. carbofos have been synthesized and
studied. but most'or them are highly toxic to animals. owing to which they have

not enjoyed much use. 0,0-Diethyl-S-(carbethoxymethyl)-dithiophosphate known in

Although it is not in use, this preparation is of connsiderable theoretical interest.
since its low toxicity to animals was predicted on the basis of research on the
metabolism of organic phosphorus compounds.

when the ester group in the acetic acid residue of atsetion and its homologues is
substituted by an amide group, the compound's insecticidal activity rises dramati-
cally; concurrently its toxicity to manuals increases as well. However, the increase
in toxicity to mammals is less significant. owing to which many such amides are of
significant practical interest. and some of them are used in agriculture. Today

seven preparations in this group of substances are in use, and a number of compOunds
are presently being studied.

0.0-Dimethyl-s-(N-methylcarbamoylmethyl)-dithiophosphate (phosphamide) is a snow-
white crystalline. substance; vapor pressure at 20°C is 8.5.10” In ﬁg: volatility
is 0.107 lag/ma. It is freely soluble in water and in most organic solvents, but it
is poorly soluble in paraffin hydrocarbons (see also Table 47).

The Lbso of pure preparation in rats is 250-265 mg/kg. Technical-grade preparation
is more toxic (L050 150-160 lug/kg) due to presence of impurities. the most important
of which is 0.0-dimethyl-s,N-methylcarbamoylmethyl)-thiophosphate (L050 in rats

55 mg/kg).

The resulting o.s-dimethyl-S-(N-methylcarbemoylmethyl)~dithiophosphate is more

When oxidized by various oxidants or atmospheric oxygen (oxidation by atmospheric
oxygen proceeds especially readily on the green leaves of plants) , phosphamide trans-
form into 0,0-dimethyl-s- (N-methylcarbamoylmethyl)-thiophosphate:

Hydrolysis of phosphamide proceeds most freely in an alkaline medium: in an acid
medium it is more stable (at 70'C 50 percent of phosphamide undergoes saponification
in 0.8 hours at pa 9 and in 21 hours at pH 2).

natabolism of phosphamide apparently differs in plants and animals. The following

Depending on the coneusption norm, the preparation usually breaks down in a plant
within 15-20 days, 0! course this also depends on the nature or the plant and
on the meteorological conditions.

Phosphanide is relatively unstable when stored, and it quickly decomposes, especially
at higher temperature. Impurities in phosphanide catalyze its composition.
Preparation containing traces of organic bases deconposes at a high rate: decompo-
sition of phosphanide in the presence of bases is accompanied by alkylation. Solu-
tions of phosphafiide in organic solvents are more stable.

phosphanide reacts with phenols and alkylphenols to produce molecular coupounds that
have been proposed tor use as insecticides (429-431).'

187
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
Usually phosphanide is marketed as a 40 percent enulsion concentrate containing.

in addition to the active ingredient, an emulsifier and organic solvent. It is
used against herbivorous mites, aphids and other sucking plant pests at preparation
consulption norm or 700-l,000 ga/ha (active ingredient). At higher concentrations
phosphanide is phytocidal.

The preparation‘s tins of. action is about 15 days. In many countries its life
expectancy is set at 10-15 days.

Phosphaaide may be obtained by two nethods: rirst, by reacting dinethyldithio-
phosphoric acid salts with N-methylchloroacetanide:

(CH,OM’SK + ClCthONllCH; —.. (Cl’l,0).PSCI!.CONIlCH, + KCI

This reaction is usually performed in a medium consisting of water and some

organic solvents. The product yield is 80-95 percent: the purity of the initial
substances has great significance.

Second, phosphanide may be obtained by reacting 0,0-dinethyl-s-(carboxymethy1)- or
s-(carbalkoxynethyl)-dithiophosphate with hydrated nethylanine at low temperature
(432):

(CH.0),Pscu.cooc.H. + CH.NH. —' (CII,0).PSCH.C0NHCH: +. c.u.ou
I
s

Both the phenyl and the ethyl esters are used. The phosphanide yield is more than
90 percent of theoretical: however, the phosphanide obtained by this method is

less stable. Stabilisation or the preparation requires very careful removal of
all ispurities, and primarily excess nethylanine, traces of which promote decomposi-
tion or phosphanide.

As with most other organophosphorus compounds, storage of phosphamide in iron con-
tainers is not recomended. Even stainless steel proaotes faster decomposition of
stored preparation.

0.0-Diaethyl-s-[IO-(B-methoxyethyl)-carbamoylnethyllodithiophosphate (tiokron) is

0,0-Diethyl-s- (6-chlorobenzoxazolinon-2-yl-3-nethy1) -dithiophosphate (phosalone)
is a white crystalline substance with the odor of garlic. Phosalone is poorly
soluble in water and freely soluble in many organic solvents (see also Table 47).

Its L050 in rats is 135 liq/k9. and in nice it is 180 lug/kg.

In an acid median phosalone is relatively stable, while hydrolysis proceeds rather
quickly in an alkaline medium. The principal hydrolysis products are 6-chloro-
benzoxazolone, diethylthiophosphoric acid and formaldehyde.

When phosalone reacts with oxidants, first the thion sulfur breaks off and the
preparation transforms into 0,0-diethyl-s-(s-chlorobenzoxazolon-z-yl-J-methyl)-
-thiophosphate, which is relatively unstable and breaks down quickly. It is believed
that this compound is the first metabolite of phosalone in plants.

Phosalone is recommended against pests of various crops. and it is a highly promising
substitute of DDT and other persistent organochloride insecticides. It is also used

as a seed disinfectant with the purpose of protecting plant sprouts against damage

of 6-chlorobensoxasolone obtained by direct chlorination of benzoxazolone in tetra-

Pyrophosphoric Acid Derivatives

Produced in Germany in 1943. tetrsethylpyrophosphate was the first organophosphorus
insecticide, known under the name of bladan and on». After information on the
insecticidal properties of tetracthylpyrophosphate and related compounds was
published, systematic research on the pesticidal properties of organic compounds of
phosphorus began. A nmer of ooapounds were found among the studied derivatives
of pyrophosphoric acid; some of them are still significant today.

me following laws were established for the dependence between insecticidal activity
and structure of pyrophosphates.

The insecticidal activity of tetrealkylPYI-‘Ophosphates decreases as the ester radical

grows in size. 'Ihe most active wound is tetraethylpyrophosphate. while the activ-'
ity of tetramethyZPYIOPhOI‘Phlte is somewhat lower.

intraalkylmonothiopyrophosphates exhibit greater insecticidal activity than tetra-
alkylpyrophosphates. but their toxicity to manuals is concurrently higher. Addi-

tion of a second sulfur atom at the phosphorus atom reduces the coapound's toxicity
to manuals without noticeably decreasing its insecticidal activity.

Addition of a third sulfur atom to the phosphorus atom reduces the comound's insect-
icidal activity. ‘mus far MIG: 0t0,0.O-tetraalkyldithiopyrophosphates have greater
insecticidal activity than do' 0.0,0.0-tetraalkyltrithiopyrophosphates with the same
hydrocarbon radicals.

‘netraalkydithiopyrophosphates containing different hydrocarbon radicals exhibit
almost the same insecticidal activity as do the corresponding synetrical tetra-
alkyldithiopyrophosphates with the same molecular weight.

All pyrophosphates have strong contact insecticidal action, and have practically

no systemic insecticidal action due to their low hydrolytic stability and fast
decouposition on plants to form nontoxic products. Systemic activity appears as

we proceed from pyrophosphoric acid esters to amides. Contact insecticidal activity

decreases in this case. Pyrophosphoric acid octamethyltetruide has been proposed
as a systemic insecticide. It does not have contact insecticidal activity, which

is why it is used to protect sulberry trees from sucking pests.

Many general methods of obtaining esters and amides of pyrophosphoric, thio-,

dithio- and trithiopyrophosphoric acids have been described in the literature.

We will note only the most iwortant methods, those having significance to pro~
duction of this type of wwds.

Phosphonic Acid Derivatives

Active insecticides, acaricides, fungicides and herbicides have been found among
the large number of alkyl- and arylphosphonic, alkylthio-, arylthio- and dithio-
phosphonic, and dialkyl- and diarylphosphonic acid derivatives, but only a few com-
pounds have found practical applications in agriculture. Host organophosphorus
derivatives of this type are still in the research stage.

The toxicity of mixed esters of methyl- and ethylthiophosphonic acids to homeothermic
animals is higher in most cases than that of analogous mixed esters of phosphoric
acid (2). though there are exceptions as well. ‘noxicity decreases as the size of

the hydrocarbon radical bound to phosphorus increases. 'me toxicity of alkylphos-
phonic acids is relatively low, and it depends to a great extent on which radicals
are bound to phosphorus. The corresponding derivatives of thio- and dithiophosphonic
acids exhibit extremely variable toxicity to manuals, which depends to a great extent
on the structure of ester radicals (293,439-441).

Mixed esters of thio- and dithioalkylphosphonic acids have insecticidal and acaricidal
action in most cases (442-455): they are active against soil-inhabiting pests as

well (453). Many amide esters of alkylphosphonic and thiophosphonic acids also have
insecticidal and acaricidal properties (456-458). Epoxypropylphosphonic acid deriva—
tives have bactericidal action (460). It would be interesting to note that substi-
tution of one of the ester radicals by a benzyl group causes fungicidal properties

to arise in alkylthio- and alkyldithiophosphonates. Benzylthiophosphonates also have
similar properties (461,462).

Many nixed esters of alkylthio- and alkyldithiophosphonic acids containing different

functional groups in both the ester radicals and the radical bound to phosphorus have
insecticidal and acaricidal properties (443,465-469,471). Insecticidal properties

have also been noted in methylphosphonate and methylthiophosphonate hydrazides (470) .

Substitution of hydrogen in the hydrocarbon radical at the phosphorus atom of alkyl-
phosphonic acid derivatives by a halogen atom reduces toxicity to vertebrates. Thus
for exasple, mixed esters and ester amides of chloromethyl-. chloromethylthio- and
chloromthyldithiophosphonic acids exhibit lower toxicity than the corresponding
derivatives of methyl-. methylthio- and methyldithiophosphonic acids (443,463,464).

Ester amides of chloromethylthiophosphonic acid have herbicidal action, and they
are reco-ended for use on rice and vegetables to control millet-like weeds (464).
It would be interesting to note that accumulation of halogen atoms in the methyl
group reduces the cospound's herbicidal activity. Complete chloronethylthiophos-
phonic acid amides are even less active, while the corresponding derivatives of
chloromethylphosphonic acid are still less active (463,464).

2-Chloroethylphosphonic acid is an interesting plant growth regulator (472-476).
lt hastens maturation of fruits, and it causes leaf fall in a number of crops.
'me action of 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid and its acid esters is based on their

decomposition and liberation of ethylene.

Allyldithiophoaphonates have nematocidal action (477,478). Alkoxyvinyldithiophos-
phonates (479) and dialkoxythiophosphonacetates (480) have similar properties.
Alkoxyvinyl-, alkylsulfonyl- and alkylsulfinyldithiophosphates have herbicidal
action (481-486). Aminomethylphosphonates have herbicidal action as well (487).

Addition of a hydroxyl radical at the carbon atom bound to phosphorus as a rule re-
duces toxicity of esters and other derivatives or alkylphosphonic acids to manuals,
though there are exceptions to this general dependence.

Enlargement of the hydrocarbon radical bomd to phosphorus reduces the toxicity
and insecticidal activity of the compound. For exasple the 1.050 in rats (lg/kg) is
2.5 for o-ethyl-O- (d-nitrophmylhnethylthiophosphonate, 25 for O-ethyl-O-Honitro-
phenyl)-isopropylthiophosphonate and 250 for o-ethyl-O-(d-nitrophenyl)-n-hexylthio-
phosphonate. micity to manuals changes depending on the structure or ester radi-
cals in the same order as for esters or phosphoric and thiophosphoric acid. Thus
o-alkyl-o-M-nitrophenyl) esters of alkylphosphonic acids are nore toxic than the
O-alkyl-o-(2.4,5-trichlorophenyl) esters or these acids.

As we proceed from alkylphosphonic. alkylthiophosphonic and alkyldithiophosphonic
acids to the derivatives of arylphosphonic, arylthiophosphonic and aryldithiophos-
phonic acids, toxicity to vertebrates decreases significantly, while in most cases
the pesticidal properties persist. This is valid primarily in relation to nixed

esters or arylphosphonic acids, which are less toxic than the corresponding esters
of alkylphosphonic acids. .

Many phosphonic and thiophosphonic acids containing thiofuran (490,491), turan \494),
piperidine (489) and other heterocyclic residues are also active insecticides,
acaricides and bactericides.

Sons conpounds of these series which have enjoyed some practical use are shown in
Table 48.

The usual nethod of obtaining nixed esters or alkylphosphonic. alkylthiophosphonic
and alkyldithiophosphonic acids is to react the appropriate acid chlorides with

alcohols. phenols and nercaptans in the presence or hydrogen chloride acceptors
(496-507) :

'nertiary anines, alkali and alkali-earth metal carbonates, caustic alkalis and other
inorganic and organic bases may be used as hydrogen chloride acceptors. Metallic
copper is often used in_ the reaction as a catalyst (496). '

Similarly as with mixed esters of thiophosphoric acid. nixed esters of alkylthio-
phosphonic acid are obtained in acetone or methylethylketone in the presence of
potash or soda by prolonged boiling or the reaction mixture. The reaction with
mercaptans is also performed in the presence of hydrogen chloride acceptors (507,
508). which are usually tertiary amines.

The alkylphosphonic. alkylthiophosphonic and alkyldithiophosphonic acids required
for the synthetic processes can be obtained by various methods (22).

Arbuzov's reaction and the Mikhaelis-Bekker reaction are among the most general
methods of forming a 0-? bond (511,512):

or into other derivatives presents certain difficulties due to the large number of

stages in the process, for which reasons a nmber of other methods of obtaining
aliphatic oonpounds with a c-P bond have been developed. Among such methods. we
should first mention the reaction between red phosphorus and alkylhalides in the
presence of powdered copper, which proceeds at 300-360' in a flow-through system
and produces satisfactory yields of alkyldichlorophosphines (22):

A similar reaction may be used to obtain phenylene-bis-dihalophosphines (514) , which

tails dialkyloxynethylphosphonate, which has insecticidal properties, is formed out
of orthotoruate and 9613 in the presence of anhydrous zinc chloride (518) . Methyl-
thiophosphonic acid chloranhydride is obtained as a mixture with dimethylthiophos-
phinic acid chloride by heating dinethyldisulfide with phosphorus chloride to
300-400'c (519). A number or other methods of obtaining alkylphosphonic and alkyl-
thiophosphonic acid chlorides have been described (22).

Various benzylpbosphonic and benzothiophosphonic acids, the esters lot which are
fully analogous with alkylphosphonic acid derivatives, are obtained similarly as
alkylphosphonic acids (520-523). Most such derivatives have fungicidal properties.

Esters and other derivatives of arylphosphonic and arylthiophosphonic acids are
also obtained by reacting actid chlorides of the corresponding acids with alcohols.
phenols or nercaptans in the presence of hydrogen chloride acceptors (524-536). The
reaction proceeds in conditions similar to those described above for aliphatic com-
pounds. The arylphosphonic and arylthiophosphonic acid chlorides required for this
purpose are obtained as follows.

A reaction is performed between hydrocarbons and phosphorus trichloride at high
temperature to obtain aryldichlorophosphines. which are then transfomed by con-
ventional methods into asylphosphonic or arylthiophosphonic acid chlorides (22).
Aryldichlorophosphines are also obtained with satisfactory yields by reacting
aromatic hydrocarbons or their derivatives with phosphorus trichloride in the
presence of Lewis acids.

Mixed esters and ester amides of arylphosphonic and arylthiophosphonic acids are
obtained with good yields by oxidation or by attachment of sulfur to the appro-
priate esters or ester amides or arylphosphonous acid; the latter are formed by

Because a umber of derivatives of phosphonic acids are enjoying extensive applica-
tion, the metabolism of some preparations in various biological media has been
studied, to include chlorofos (274, 538 539), difonat (540 $41), VTsS-SOG ($42) and
other preparations of this type. It should be noted that the P-C bond is rather
strong, and that during metabolism it is broken apart rather slowly; compounds having
swastituents such as halogen, hydroxyl and so on at the o-carbon atom are an excep-
tion. Such commands break down rather quickly to form. in the end, phosphoric acid,
which is assimilated completely by plants. The most important representatives of
this type of cospounds are presented below.

0,0-Dimethyl-(boxy-2.2.2-trichloroethyl)-phosphonate (chlorofos) is a white
crystalline powder: its solubility (gm/100 gm) is 12.3 in water, 15.2 in benzene
and 75 in chloroform. It is poorly soluble in paraffin hydrocarbons. Determination
of the molecular weight of chlorofos showed that it is a dimeric compound. The
vapor pressure of chlorofos at 20°C is 7. 8 10‘6 m 89. Its volatility is 0.11 ng/m3
(see also Table 48).

I

Chlorofos is classified as a moderately toxic compound. Its L059 in rats is 560
mg/kg. The maximum permissible concentration in air is 0.5 mg/m.

The preparation is broadly employed against various plant pests (sucking and gnawing).
to include eurygaster,codling moth, corn borer, various species of flies and the
cattle fly. The cattle fly is controlled by a special form of the preparation con-
niningchlorofos solution mixed with mineral oil and isopropyl or butyl alcohol.

This solution penetrates quickly through the animal's skin. which permits dramatic
reduction of the dose of the preparation used to process the animals. '

chlorofos is stable in an acid medium and undergoes fast hydrolysis in an alkaline
medium; hydrolysis proceeds along two pathways. In an acid medium the first product
ofhydrolysis is o-mthyl-(l-oxy-2,2,2-trichloroethyl)-phosphonic acid, which hydro-
lyzes further to phosphoric acid:

Chlorofos decomposes especially quickly when exposed to light in dilute solutions.

grouping. The principal reaction product is 0,0-dimethyl-O-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-
phosphate (DDVP):

tailor-ores is a good nethylating agent. and tor example it can react with potassium
iodide to tor- nethyliodide.

when aqueous solutions of chlorotos are stored for a long 'period or tine, the pre-
paration undergoes partial hydrolysis, owing to which the solution becomes acidic due

to presence of phosphoric. dinethylphosphoric and hydrochloric acids. Storage of
chlorofos in unlined iron containers is not recon-sanded.

Inducing agents also decospose chlorofos.
No methods can be used to obtain it on an industrial scale:

1. Condensation of dinethylphosphite with chloral:

(CH,0).PHO + CCI,CHO —o (CliaohP—CHCCI,

36a

The reaction proceeds at room temperature, and heat is liberated. Chlorotos may be
obtained with a practical quantitative yield.

The purity of the initial dinethylphosphite has great significance in this nethod.

the purer the diaethylphosphite is, the greater is the yield and the better is the
quality or the chlorotos. It is best to use distilled dinethylphosphite. It can

be distilled in a file evaporator at 5-8 In ﬁg. Such dinethylphosphite usually
contains 93-96 percent principal substance. and when it is used, 93-95 percent chloro-
tos forms, with a .811 quantity or acidic ilpurities. When technical-grade undis-
tilled dinethylphosphite is used. the concentration of the principal substance in

the resulting chlorotos is 87-88 percent. It contains a rather large anount of
acidic ispurities, as well as O-nethyl-Z.2,2-trichloro-l-oxyethylpmsphonic acid

and the reaction product or chloral and phosphoric acid.

The dinethylphosphite required for synthesis of chlorotos is obtained by reacting
phosphorus trichloride with methanol:

PCI. 4- 3C|l,0|l —> (Cll,0):|’ll0 + 2IICI + CII,CI

Usually the process is pertorned in an organic solvent at low temperature. Methyl-
chloride is a convenient solvent. It boils at 44°C,. and as it evaporates it cools
the reaction mixture while sinultaneously removing the hydrogen chloride formed.

Dinathylphosphite is usually obtained in a continuous process. After the reaction

ends, the solvent is distilled away, and the light fractions are evaporated in a
colum. Dinethylphosphite is purified by distilling it in a tile evaporator at a

tesperature on the order at 120°C at 5-8 III ﬂg. The dinethylphosphite yield in this
method exceeds 90 percent, if we count phosphorus trichloride.

Obtaining dinethylphosphite in the presence of water has been proposed as a way of
avoiding formation or nethylchloride (549) :

At high teQerature phosphoric acid is capable of undergoing disproportion-.ation,
releasing phosphine:

‘HJ’O. —' 3H.PO. + P";

When the process of obtaining dimethylphosphite is performed incorrectly, liberation
of phosphine may be a cause of spontaneous combustion.

A. In the second method the reaction of forming dimethylphosphite and its reaction

with chloral are combined into a single stage. The process is performed in organic
solvent, with the heat being extracted:

3CH30H + PCI. + CC|,CHO —e (Cl{,0).P-CIICCI. + 01.0 + 211C]

The chlorofos yield in this' combined method is more than 80-85 percent.

Chlorofos is purified by recrystallizing it out of water or organic solvent. The
mother liquor from chlorofos recrystallization is usually used to produce DOW, which
is enjoying increasingly greater application in agriculture and at home.

There are many modifications of the second method of obtaining chlorofos. Various
solvents can be used (carbon tetrachloride, methylchloride, chlorobenzene etc.),-
the process can be performed in a broad interval of temperatures. Chlorofos may
be obtained by both the first and the second method in periodic and continuous
processes (543,544).

Chlorofos obtained by the methods described above can be purified by washing away
the acidic impurities in chloroform solution; when the latter is evaporated away,
the resulting chlorofos contains more than 90 percent principal ingredient and a
minimum quantity of impurities. Hettable powders are easily produced from such
chlorofos. Surfactants and solid carriers performing the role of crystallization
centers are added to technical-grade chlorofoe to hasten its crystallization (545).

A large number of analogues and homologues of chlorofos has been synthesized, but
their insecticidal properties are significantly weaker than those of chlorofos.
Thus for example, 0.0-diethyl-(l-oxy-Z,2,2-trichloroethyl)-phosphonate is almost
15 times less active against flies than chlorofos, and it is more toxic to homeo-
thermic animals. Mung the derivatives of chlorofos, some of its esters with
various acids have attracted interest in their use as insecticides.

in water and freely soluble in most organic solvents (see also Table 48).

Its 1.050 in rats is 700 lug/kg.

Butonate has strong contact action, and it is used mainly against ectoparasites in
domesticated animals. It is marketed as an emulsion concentrate.

The preparation is more resistant to hydrolysis than chlorofos. Its hydrolysis pro-

ceeds quickly in an alkaline medium. the end products of hydrolysis are phosphoric,
hydrochloric and butyric acids.

Phosphoniun salts

Besides phosphoric acid esters and amides. some salts of substituted phosphoniun,
which have varied pesticide]. activity, have been studied as pesticides. One of the
first to be used against moths was 3.s-dichlorobenzyltriphenylptwsphonim chloride,
which was an ingredient of eylan, with which furs and wool were impregnated to
prevent destruction by moths. ntraalkylphosphoniun salts have almost the same

bactericidal and fungicidal action as do ammonia salts with identical hydrocarbon
radicals (547).

i

The preparation fosfon-m-tributyl-Z,4-trichlorobenzylphospmnimchloride enjoyed some

Systematic study of the biological activity of phosphonium salts established that

the activity of a compound depends not only on the structure of the cation but also
on the structure of the anion. Substances have been found among phosphoniun salts

that exhibit not only microbiological and insecticidal activity but also herbicidal
properties (548). However, they have not as yet found practical applications.

Sons practical applications as a fungicide have been found for the binary salt of
triphenyldecylphosphonim bromide and triphenylol chloride (melting point lld‘c,

Despite the fact that research on the pesticidal properties or e-triasine derivatives
began relatively recently, there have been significant successes in this area, and

a large nuﬂaer of preparations have found practical applications in agriculture and
industry. Triazines o: the following types (XII-XVIII) are used as pesticides (61):

wounds with general tormla XII containing an aliphatic radical at the noncyclic
nitrogen ato- are inadequately stable, and they do not enjoy practical use. though
they do have herbicidal properties. when this aliphatic radical is replaced by an
arc-latic radical the PhYV-OQidal properties decrease. and the compound's fungicidal
activity rises. the most active cospound used against plant diseases is LII-di-
chloro-S-(2'-chiorophenyia|ino)-s-triazine (diren). Its isomers with halogen in
other positions are less active.

Compounds with general tormula XIII exhibit high herbicidal activity in the event
that the hydrocarbon radicals at the noncyclic nitrogen atom contain not more than
(our carbon atoms. When the length of the carbon chain of the radicals at the nitro-
gen atom increases (>C.,) , the oonpound's herbicidal activity decreases. A similar
law is observed with the series of compounds with general formula XIV.

When a halogen atom is substituted by a hydroxyl group the compound loses its herbi-
cidal properties completely, while substitution by an alkoxyl group (compounds with
formula XV) or an alkylmercapto group (compounds with tormla XVI) , the compound's
selectivity changes while herbicidal properties are retained. Oompomds of this
series exhibit optimise activity when the alkoxyl or alkylmercapto group contains

one carbon atom, though there are indications in the literature that compounds con-
taining a carbomethylmercapto group (62,63) and some other groups (64) do have herbi-
cidal properties as well. Substitution of the halogen atom by a 2-chlorallylnercapto

(65, 66), benzylmercapto (61) or benzyloxy group (68) causes fungicidal properties
to appear.

2-Pluoro, 2-azido (70-73), 2-cyano (75-77), 2-dia1ky1aninooxy (78) and 2-dialky1amino-
mercapto (79) d-alkylamino-6—alky1anino-s-triazines also have herbicidal properties.
Herbicidal properties are possessed by 2-asido-d-methylmercapto-6-alkylamino-a- -tri-
azines (69, 74) and trialkoxy-e-triazines (80) as well.

Herbicidal properties are exhibited by diamino-s-triazines containing hydrocarbon
radicals at the noncyclic nitrogen of the most diverse structure, to include secondary
(61,82) and tertiary (61,83,84) alkyl groups, msaturated groupings (85-89) such as
allyl (87), acetylene hydrocarbon residues (86,89) and polytluoroalkyl groups (90.91)
obtained in the reaction between 2-chloro-4-alky1amino-6-aminotriazine and polyfluoro-
chloracetones :

mercapto-d-alkylamino-6-a1koxya1kyl-a-triazines (101-104) and -6-alkylnercaptoalky1-
triazines (105) have been patented for use as herbicides. s-‘l‘riazines containing
heterocyclic radicals at the nitrogen atom have also been described (106,107).

-triazines (109-112) , containing (as the acyl group) carboxylic and sultonic acid
residues as well as residues of various derivatives of the acids of phosphorus, have
been patented as herbicides.

A large number of s-triazines containing a nitrile group in the hydrocarbon radical

literature (119,120) . but they have not yet achieved practical use.

Substitution of me or the hydrocarbon radicals at the noncyclic nitrogen atom in
dianiho-s-triaz‘hes, by an alkoxyl group reduces the_coupound's stability and decreases
its life, which may be or great practical interest in relation to some compounds (81).

But when the radicals in the amino groups are dirterent, a two-stage process would
be suitable. In the first stage one of the seine molecules is made to react, forming
2 ,4-dichloro-6-alkylamino-s-triazines1 one molecule of the secondary amine is then
attached to the latter. Both inorganic and organic bases or excess amine can be

used as the hydrogen chloride acceptor.

This reaction is at the basis of industrial acquisition of 2-chloro-4 6-bis-(alky1-

cyanurochloride may also be obtained by the action of phosphorus pentachloride on

cyanuric acid (the yield is 55-59 percent, while when cyanogen chloride is subjected
to polymerisation, the cyanurochloride yield is more than 90 percent or theoretical):

when nethylrhodanide is chlorinated, the cyanurochloride yield is 85 percent, but
it is difficult to remove other chlorination products from the target compound.

Pure cyanurochloride is a white crystalline substance with a melting point of. 146-147'
l46-ld7‘c, it is practically insoluble in water, and it is. freely soluble in most
organic solvents. It is readily hydrolyzed by water, transforming into cyanuric .
acid. hydrolysis proceeds especially quickly at high temperature and in the presence
of bases. mis must be considered when using cyanurochloride to synthesize substi-
tuted triazines in an aqueous median. In the presence of bases, cyanurochloride
reacts with many compounds containing active hydrogen.

Gaseous cyanurochlw ids formed out of cyanogen chloride upon trimerization in
charcoal catalyst may be used to obtain symtrical chlorotriasines: cyanuro-
chloride is passe: through an aqueous solution of amine and sodiun hydroxide (134).

me formed chloroaminotriazine is siltered, washed with water and dried. This
method can be used to obtain simazine (Figure 21) and propazin. Other triasines ,
obtained by this method are low in quality because they contain a large quantity or
related mounds. This process can also be employed to obtain symetrical fluoro-
triazines, using four moles of amine to every mole of cyanurocnloride (134). In

this case the process is carried out without adding sodium hydroxide, and the amine
is regenerated in the next stage.

Acquisition of asyunetrical triazines may be demonstrated with the example of
atrazine:

'lhese reactions are easily perforned even in the sane apparatus, since the second
reaction proceeds at a higher temperature than the first.

It has been suggested that in some cases the reaction of obtaining asymtrical
chloroaninotriasine should be carried out in a mixture or water and an organic
solvent that is iniscible with water. In this case the 2,4-dichloro-6-alkylamino-
triasine formed in the first stage moves into the organic solvent, which reduces
the possibility of its hydrolysis by water and its interaction with the second
amine molecule. Chlorobensene, dichloroethane and a nusber of others have been
recounended as organic solvents. The reaction with the second amine as a rule
results in a product poorly soluble in organic solvents and readily filtered out.

A flowchart for acquisition of atrezine is shown in Figure 22.

It should be noted that owing to high persistence, production of symtrical
fluorothiazines such as sinazine and properin is continually decreasing. These

coepounds are being substituted by less-persistent preparations--prinarily various
2-mthylnercapto-d,6-bie-alkylanino-s-triazines as well as the corresponding arides.
The latter can be obtained either‘ by an exchange reaction between the appropriate
chloride derivatives and sodium aside (139)

2-mthy1mercapto-4.6-bie-(alkylanind-O-triazinea nay be obtained, as was indicated
earlier, by reacting nethylnercaptide with 2-chloro-4,6-bie-(alkylanino)-e-triazines
(141) . This reaction proceeds both in an aqueous media: and in organic solvents.
According to the patent literature. when isopropyl or sac-butyl alcohol is used

as the solvent, the yield 0: the end product may climb as high as 98 percent. The
reaction proceeds at 70-7S'C (141,142).

In another interesting method, 2-mthylnercapto-4.6-bie-(alkylanino)-a-triazines
are obtained as follow (1(3):

The merit of this nethod is that it does not require acquisition of nethylnercaptan.

However, the process consists of. many stages, and it requires the use of toxic
dinethylsultata and rather expensive thiourea.

A simpler method of obtaining 2-nethylmercapto-4,6~bis-(alkylanino)-e-triazines is

to react 2-chloro-4,6-bis-(alkylaninokbtriazines with a mixture or sodiua sulfide
and sodium polysultide: .

The reaction proceeds relatively easily in an aqueous solution at high temperature.
The resulting eodiua sait of 2-mercapto-4.6-bia-(alkylanino)-a-triarine is easily
transforned. without separation, into Z-nethyinercapto-4,6-bia-(alkyalmino)-e-triazine

in response to the action or dinethylsulrate. The yield or the sought triazine
exceeds 90 percent of theoretical.

however. intermediate 2-mrcapto-4,6-bis-(alkylanim)-8-triazine can also be obtained
by oxidation with mineral acids: in this case the final Z-nethylnercepto product is
completely free or initial chlorotriazine impurities. This method requires simple
apparatus, and it provides a sufficiently pure Z-uthylaercapto coupound (148).

Moreover 2-mothylnercapto-4,6—bis-(alkylanino)-s-triazine can also be obtained by
' the toliowing pathway (144-147):

The process may be carried out in both an aqueous radius and in a nixture of water
and an iniscible organic solvent: either alkali or organic bases can be used as

the hydrogen chloride acceptor. There are indications that the entire series or
the transrornations described here may be carried out within a single reactor.

in which individual stages of. the reaction are performed in succession (146).

As was noted earlier, 2-alkoxy-4,6-bis-(alkylanino)-s-triasines may be obtained by
the action or alkali netal alcoholates upon the appropriate chlorotriasines. The
reaction proceeds most readily in organic solvents at high teaperature.

Host substituted s-triasines are sufficiently stable at room temperature, but when
heated to 240-250°C. they undergo dealkylation to form olefins (149). It has been
established that the principal pathways 0! metabolic transformation of triazines

are: hydrolysis (in which halogen atom and alhoxyl and nethylnercapto groups are

split off). dealkylation at the noncyclic nitrogen aton, and splitting of the
triasine ring: these reactions proceed at different rates in ditterent udia. It

is believed that hydrolysis is catalyzed in plants resistant to chlorotriasines by
2 , 4-dioxy- 7-nethoxybenso-l , 4-orasinone-3 (lSl , 156) .

The netabolisn of prouetryne is an exasple of this (see diagram on p 252).

In addition to the s-triazines described above, a large umber of other ooapounds of
this series with pesticidal properties have been synthesized, particularly 2-chloro-
~4-dialkylanino-G-dialkylthioanido-s-triasines, which have fungicidal properties
(157).

Among the hydrated derivatives of s-triasine, mention should be made or the deriva-
tives of tetrahydro-s-triazine (158.159) and l-aryl-4.6-diisopropyl-3,5-dinethyl-
hexahydro-o-triazine (160) . which have herbicidal properties, and a nuaber of
,other derivatives of .Mhyumétriazine possessing insecticidal and fungicidal

properties (161) , though they have not as yet achieved practical applications in
this direction. Various products of cyanuric acid that are easily obtained by

thernal cyclization of urea should be included among the derivatives or hexahydro-s-
-triazine:

the simplest derivatives of cyanuric acid are binary coupounds of copper salts,
which have a chelate structure and which possess fungicidal properties (162).
tungicidal and bactericidal properties are exhibited by chloro- and dichlorocyanuric
acids and their alkali metal salts (163) as well as by trichlorocyanuric acid, which

is easily obtained by chlorination of cyanuric acid in aqueous alkali solution (164) .
Depending on the chlorination conditions and the number of chlorine atone, all three
derivatives of cyanuric acid may be obtained.

The sodium salt of dichlorocyanuric acid has enjoyed the broadest use as a bleach.
an antiseptic and a disinfecting preparation. It has almost no odor at all, it is
readily soluble in water,,and it contains a significant quantity of active chlorine.

Herbicidal action is also exhibited by bensotetrahydro- and bensohexahydro- deriva-
tives of e-triazine with general formula xxv: (165-167).

A compound with formula Mind-amino-B-uthylnercapto-ﬁtcrt-butyl-l,2,4-tri-
azinone-S (netributin)--has recently achieved practical use of a herbicide. It
consists of colorless crystals with a melting point of 118-125.S'c.

Its solublility in water at 20°C is 1.2 gn/liter, and it is freely soluble in organic
solvents (168,169).

Its 1.050 in rats is 2,200 tag/kg; its acso in fish is about 10 reg/liter.

Metributin is produced in the form of 70 percent wettable powder. It is used
against di- and monocotyledonous weeds in soy, potatoes and other crops (168-171).

Other bensotriazines (172,173), benzotetrazines (174) and seven-nesbered heterocycles
with three nitrogen atous (175) have also been proposed as pesticides.
Derivatives of Other Heterocycles

In addition to the derivatives of the heterocycles described above, a number of

heterocyclic compounds are presently being studied in production conditions as
sexual sterilizers of insects. Coupounds with sterilizing action include some
derivatives of folic acid XXVIn:

As is true with 5-fluorouracil and S-flmtouracil-G-cerbowlii: acid (see Chapter 28) ,
the action of these ooupomde is appamtly based on substitution of metabolites.
