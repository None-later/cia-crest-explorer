[Article by H. Kris, MD, District National Committee, Preaov: "Physical Fitness
of 18-Year Old Draftees in Presov Okrea"l

[Text] Our socialist society offers unprecedented opportunities for a high
standard of physical and mental health. Physical fitness of our population is
one of the areas with a great potential for improvement of the quality of health.
A systematic exogenous action on the genetic base of the organism may substan-
tially affect the quality of health which, in the form of good physical fitness,
may affect the rate of morbidity, disability and mortality due to cardiovascular
diseases during the reproductive age, as well as improve the potential of the
defense of our socialist achievements. Furthermore, it also may improve the ad-
ministrative capacity of our leading officials and provide a genetic support for
the condition of health of the future generations.

The beneficial effect of exertion on physical fitness was already known in ancient
Greece; the English aristocracy, fearing degeneration and indolence, organized
athletic and tennis clubs. Prof A. Hollenberger, a cardiologist of world renown,
declared that regular daily exercise under submaximum stress practically prevents
myocardial infarction. Academician Hiasnikov says that the precondition for
longevity is the development of the genetic base, namely, walking or jogging

10 km every day, maintaining one's body weight at the level of 22 years even at
an advanced age, abstinence from smoking and avoidance of stress. In the opinion
of Academician Amosov, if today's generation fails to change its lifestyle dra-
matically, it is to be expected that in some 30 or 60 years half of the popula-
tion will be disabled and become a burden for the other half. Research conducted
in certain areas of the world (Indian tribes in Mexico, South America, the popu-
lation in the Swiss community of Blattendorf, where myocardial infarction has not
been observed) indicates that motor activity is one of the extremely important
factors in preventing the "diseases of civilization."

Motor activity is regarded as one of the factors responsible for higher ICHS.

Lack of physical training leads to analogical changes as in predominance of the
sympathetic nervous system. Raab observed a linear ascendant of the PR [pulse

rate] and a decline in the isometric phase with declining physical training.
Exercise induces sympathetic inhibition and increased elimination of catechola-
mines in the urine, thus changing the enzymatic relations of the heart. Correla-
tions have been ascertained between physical inactivity and the incidence of

Ftﬂl(ﬂﬂﬂ(1Al.USE4DNLY

cardiac diseases and deaths. According to Schimert, physical exertion beneficially
affects the body weight, reduces cholesteremia and lipemia; lowers blood pressure;
improves cardiac action which becomes more economical due to a higher volume of
the pulse and a lower PR. Prolonged and regular physical activity and exercise
protect the heart from adrenergic vulnerability. From this it follows that motion
affects the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. However, this effect lasts
only so long as the training continues! Physical fitness affects favorably also
the thrombotic response, improves fibrinolysis, cardiac metabolism, PR, and col-
lateral cardiac circulation; it affects enzymes, such as LDH and glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase, and hormones, such as insulin, the growth hormone, the
steroids, thyroxine. and the androgens. Brief physical exertion connected with
great strain has a more decisive effect!

Advancing automation results in muscular starvation, in higher demands on the CNS
[central nervous system]. in symptoms of illness caused by insufficient motor
activity (hypokinesia-Rsab). Its opposite is kinesophilia, the need to move.

A certain degree of Our inherited physical fitness (Grebe 1963) may be enhanced
by systematic exercise, which may increase nonspecific resistance against environ-
mental factors (Zimkin 1960). Resistance has a peak which may be reached but
which fades rapidly if we fail to be consistent and systematic.

Under the concept of "fitness" we understand the ability of good physical per-
formance in work and in personal life, and the optimum reaction to environmental
stimuli. Physical fitness is a narrower concept which denotes creation of proper
conditions for strenuous motor activity with regards to environmental factors.
Performance, an even narrower concept, is the ability to execute a physical feat
in a unit of time. It may be said that every citizen of our socialist society
should try to improve his fitness. Motor sympathicotonia and the subsequent
parasympathicotonia at rest may greatly enhance subjective feelings of health and
expand the scope of adaptability to environmental factors and thus, a young person
may very substantially affect his cardiovascular condition at a later age.

Method

we examined 75 young men born in 1961 who reside in Sabinov and Lipany (city
youths) and 75 young men from more distant villages in the area of the terri-
torial polyclinic in Sabinov, in the northern part of Presov Okres, who had pre-
sented themselves for conscription for basic military service. He obtained our
material from the files of the District Military Administration in Presov. He

do not disclose here the total number of the youths because of military secrecy.
According to Fekete's scheme, our system is significant. At the first draft, 14
percent of the tocal number of the youths were found temporarily unfit for mili-
tary service. From the rest we selected absolutely healthy individuals diagnosed
as unaffected by any disease. We did not test any ophthalmological, orthopedic
and other defects; our intention was to determine the physical condition of the
above-mentioned youths. The objective of our study was to demonstrate that mor-
tality, morbidity and disability may be basically influenced and thus, the eco-
nomic factor improved by a lower rate of PNS and disability, and to demand better
performance in the unit of time from individuals who are better fit physically.
In addition to the physical examination, we also conducted a poll in the form of
a questionnaire of the subjects. which appears in the tables. We tested physical

fitness by the U 170 method. Under the same conditions we induced graduated stress
with weight equal to 1.5 and 2 H/kg. The subjects performed this work on a bicycle
ergometer attached to one-leak EKG in the V 4 area and on nanometer. The work is
based on the following relation:

The enclosed scheme presents a record of the test (Graph 1) with current personal
data, stress values in watt/kg of weight, values of the pulse at rest, blood pres-
sure. values of fats from the tests of folds pursuant to Parizkova's method. the
PRC index of l70/kg of weight, as well as the PR and the values of blood pressure
after the stress and during recuperation. The duration of individual periods of
stress was 4 minutes and the period of recuperation 5 minutes. In the graph we
register the PR after the first stress period and six-fold value of stress in
watts, i.e., kpm. We register the values after the second stress period in an
analogical nanner. By connecting the points thus obtained and by their extension
we obtain a line on which we seek by extrapolation the value of PRC l70/kpm/min.
In other words, we study how many kpm the subject can achieve at the pulse rate of
170, i.e., under submaximum stress. We derive a certain value in kpm which, di-
vided by the weight of the subject. produces the PHC index l70/kg of weight, ac-
cording to which we evaluate physical fitness. If we divide the amount of kpm at
PR 170 by 6, we obtain the value of work expressed in watts which the subject per-
formed at the pulse rate of 170. By dividing this value by his weight, we obtain
a value which indicates how many watts the subject performs at the PR of 170 of
his weight. 0n the basis of this weight, we assess his physical fitness.

Results

Table 1 represents the value of pulse rate, at rest, after the first and after the
second stress period. and during recuperation. According to Raab, the better the
training, the lower the PR at rest. After stress, the heart of a trained indi-
vidual reacts by raising the pulse volume to the detriment of the heart rate. The
heart reacts to stress by raising the PR because the volume of pulsation rises
Only slightly from the norm of 60 ml in untrained individuals and up to 120 ml in
trained individuals. when the value of the volume of pulsation in a trained indi-
vidual is exhausted. the heart increases its rate. Good indicators of brsdycardia
at rest were observed in three of the city subjects and in three of the country
youths, which is a percent of the system. All of them were active athletes (in
various types of sports), with the exception of one 18-year old country youth who.
however, was working in construction assembly. earning Kcs 4,000; thus, it may be
presumed that this individual performed extremely strenuous physical work. Values
of PR at rest within the norm were observed in one-third of the tested individuals;
6a percent of the city and 65.3 percent of the country youths demonstrated higher
values of PR at rest. Table 4 presents median values of the PR at rest, which
amount to 85.9/min in the city youths. and to 84.9/min in country youths, i.e.,

a value higher than our norm. After the first stress period 1.5 H/kg of weight

we regard as a good indicator one that does not exceed PR over l30/min. Roughly
one-third of our subjects appeared within the range of that "norm." Adverse PR
values over 150/min were demonstrated in 14 city and 13 country youths. The mean
PR value after an exercise load of 1.5 W/kg is 138.1/min for city youth and 135.6
for country youth, as indicated in Table 4. A good PR of under lSO/min after a
second exercise was achieved by 28 percent city and 3é.7 percent of country boys.
Some 28 percent of city and almost 19 percent of country boys have very unsatis-
factory PR of over 170/min. Mean values in Table 4 are 158.6 heart beats for city
and 157.6 beats for country bays. Mean PR after the first and after the second
exercise load show slightly increased PR to above 130 and 150/min [respectively
for city and country boys]. Good adaptability of the heart muscle to adjust to
rest would be reflected in a PR no higher than 20 percent of the at-rest value
after a 5 minute recuperation. However. we must take into consideration rela~
tively high at-rest PR values. Some 53.3 percent of city boys and 66 percent of
country boys fit into correct category. Mean PR for recuperated boys in Table 6
is lOS/min with upper limit of 20 percent is 102/min. for country boys 102.5 (101
min). It can be seen from this, that the recuperation of the heart muscle is just
above the acceptable limit of 20 percent of the at-rest PR. The better trained
the individual, the closer is his PR to the at-rest condition.

Table 2 presents the values of blood pressure [BP] after stress of 1.5 and 2 w/kg.
Values at rest are within the norm partly because this test dealt with subjects
unaffected by any morbid changes. The values of blood pressure elevated by 10 torr
at 30 kpm are within the norm. If we take the median value of weight from Table 4,
the result is average stress of 100 H, i.e., 600 kpm in the first stress period;
thus, the values of BP up to 150 mm Hg (less than 20 kPa) are within the norm.
These values were obtained in 24 percent of the city, and in 37.3 percent of the
country 18-year old youths. Analogically. in the second stress period the values
under 170 umIHg (less than 22.66 kPa) were within the norm. This value was ob-
tained in 26 percent of the youths in both groups; relatively high values over

Table 3 reviews the functional fitness of the subjects. As mentioned above, the
amount of the kpm value at PR 170 was theoretically determined by extrapolation,
and divided by the weight of the subject; its result is index PHC 170 kpm/kg/min.
According to this index we rate physical fitness as excellent if the index is
above 20, from 18.0-19.9 as above average, from 16.0-17.9 as average, from l4-15.9
as below average, and under 13.9 as insufficient. From the table it appears that
physical fitness of 4 percent of the city youths (3 individuals) and of 2.7 percent
of the country youths (2 individuals) qualified as excellent; 5.3 percent (4) city
youths and 4.0 percent (3) country youths were above average; 12 percent (9) of
the city youths and the same number of the country youths were average. If we
take average physical fitness as the norm, then 21.3 percent (16) of the city, and
18.7 percent (14) of the country youths are in the range of the PRC index of 170
kpm/kg/min. In the range below average and insufficient physical fitness are 59
city and 61 country youths. The median value of the index in Table 4 is 14.23 in
the city, and 14.11 in the country youths; thus, in both groups it appears on the
lower level of the index for below-average physical fitness. We obtain the same
results if we divide the kpm by 6; the results denotes the amount of stress exe-
cuted by the subject at PR 170. If we divide this number by his weight, we obtain
the value in Hlkg. According to this value, the individual who deals with more
than 3.33 H/kg of his weight at PR 170/min is physically fit; the range from 3.0-
3.32 is above average, from 2.66-2.99 H/kg of weight is average, from 2.34-2.65 is
below average. Below 2.33 physical fitness is insufficient. The average value is
2.36 H/kg of weight, and as in the preceding table, it appears on the lower level
of the below-average physical fitness.

The answers of the subjects in the questionnaire were strictly confidential. From
Table 5 it appears that 58 city, and 39 country youths did not smoke. High values
in alcohol consumption amount to 55 city, and 65 country youths. One may speak
only of the second degree of alcoholism. since the subjects only recently reached
their 18th birthday and became legally able to consume alcoholic beverages. Among
the city youths, 20 percent were nonswimmers,asweresligbtlyover 30 percent of the
country youths. Interesting is their sexuality: 34 city, and 60 country youths
admitted intercourse with the opposite sex. In our test we determined fat by mea-
suring skin folds with a caliper according to Pariskova's method. Although Paris-
kova established up to 14 percent of the body weight as a norm for the middle-age
generation, in our opinion the values of fat in 18—year old youths must be rated
according to criteria for athletes. Pat as ICES risk factor was determined in 35
city, and 47 country youths as above the norm of 11 percent. Table 6 presents the
median value of height and weight of 176.8 cm and 66.99 kg in the city, and 173.2
cm and 68.43 kg in the country yguths. The median value of fat is 11.72 percent
of the body weight for the 75 city youths, and 12.5 percent for the country youths,
in other words, these values are well below norm. Prom other questions which are
not included in Table 5 it appears that a small number of the yOuths regularly
compete in sports; not a single subject walked at least 5 km daily. In most cases
they walk from their home to the bus station. A very small number of subjects at-
tended concerts and theater. however. every month they visited taverns frequently.

Conclusion

It is not our intention to imply that in general, physical fitness of the 18-year
old generation is below average. we are able to say this with assurance only with
regards to a group of 18-year old youths in the northern part of Preaov Okres with-
in the range of the polyclinic in Sabinov, who were born in 1961 and subject to
draft for military service. In view of the results obtained we concluded that this
test should be repeated with future classes of 18-year old youths in other okreses
of Slovakia. If such results prove to be a rule, then it is imperative to begin
as early as in nursery schools with the prevention of the diseases of civilization.
The physical fitness of our population may be improved if every individual and
every ministry cooperate (for example. education; construction-—creation of health
zones; competitions-short daily programs of physical fitness; environmental pro-
tection; public health). As health workers, we should adopt the words of P. Hhite
who in his lecture in Burlington in 1964, "To Practice "hat He Preach," spoke about

prevention of cardiovascular diseases and appealed to physicians to set an example
for others by their own lifestyle. Our socialist society offers us such oppor-
tunities. here we see one of such opportunities to cut morbidity. disability and
mortality caused by cardiovascular diseases.

Summary

The author tested physical fitness in a significant group of 18-year old youths
from an area in Presov Okres using Pekete's program, the H 170 method, as well as
a confidential questionnaire. From the report presented here it appears that the

tested group needs to improve considerably the physical potential of the body. If
this indicator should prove to be the rule. then physical fitness must be upgraded
with the cooperation of all interested parties by a program for improving the con-
dition of our population's health.
