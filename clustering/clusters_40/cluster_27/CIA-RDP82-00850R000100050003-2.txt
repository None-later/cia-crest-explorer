and conduct asasures related to evacuation of the population;
evacuation reception cosnissions are for-ed in the suburban zones.
Evacuation ssauﬂy points are set up in the cities for sending off
the population being evacuated, and evacuation receiving points
are established in the suburban area to receive and place the

Paras crops are protected against weapons of less destruction to cut
losses of yield and receive good-quality food products;

Steps taken when crops are contaminated by radioactive substances;

Determining the level of contamination of crops by radioactive sub-
stances;

Watering, interrow tillage. and top dressing with mineral fertilizers
on contaminated crops to preserve the harvest;

Applying additional fertilizer and lining acid soils to reduce the
intake of radioactive substances iron the soil to the plants;

Deep plowing (to 60 cu) to reduce the amount of radioactive sub-
stances in the root layer of the soil;

Steps taken when crops are contaminated by bacterial (biological)
agents;

Determining the degree of crop contuination by bacterial (bio-
logical) agents;

Spraying (dusting) crops with fungicides by airplane (helicopter);

Spraying (dusting) crops with fungicides by ground far- machine;
