lTvxt] Hepatitis virus 3 consists of spherical parcicles,42 nm in diameter [1],
whose external membrane is made up mainly of so-called surface antigen (HBQAg),
while the nucleocapsid, 27 nm in diameter, consists of internal or core antigen
(HBcAg). In the nucleocapsid iscontained double-stranded DNA,3200 nucleotides

in length, with a single break in one of the chains and an unoccupied segment 400
to 1500 nucleotides in length in the other [2, 3]. It is possible to build up the
single-strand DNA segment in vitro by virtue of the presence in the nucleocapsid
of endogenous DNA Polymerase [4], which utilizes the 3' end of the short chain as
primer for synthesis.

since blood plasma from patients with hepatitis B or chronic carriers of the virus
are the only source of virus or its antigens, until recently there was extremely
limited possibility of studying the structure of viral macromolecules and molecular
mcrhtuisms of replication, as well as of developing antiviral vaccine and diag-
nostic products. The situation changed because of the cloning of DNA of hepatitis
virus 8 in E. coli as part of vectors derived from A phage [5, 6] or plasmids
[7-9], which was helpful primarily in the study of the structure of viral DNA.
Determination of the nucleotide sequence in cloned DNA made it possible to localize
the MDSAg {9, 10] and ﬂBcAg (11] genes. At the present time, the complete sequence
of DNA of hepatitis virus B of two subtypes is known: ayw [12] and adwz [13].
Moreover, expression of HBcAg [11] and HBsAg (14] genes in E. coli was obtained,
and in the latter case the antigenic determinants of HBsAg were contained in a
larrc chimeric protein, 852 of whose sequence is referable to bacterial B-galac-
tosidasc. The level of production of such protein in bacterial cells is not high
enough (about 0.051 of all protein), and it is notable for instability [14]. Con-
sequently, the problem of expression of an genes of hepatitis virus B in bacteria
cannot be considered definitively solved. Moreover, since differences were demon-
strated in the DNA sequence of subtypes adw and adwz virus [12, 13], each new
structure of DNA of hepatitis virus B is of definite interest. For this reason,
we undertook cloning of viral DNA in E. coli within the pBR322 plasmid. In this
article. we submit evidence of the structure of cloned DNA and its tentative
physical map.

Viral particles were isolated from the blood plasma of donors, which was positive
fur nuxAg and endogenous DNA polymerase activity. The obtained viral preparations
Urrr tested with electron microscopy. The single-stranded DNA segment was built

up by means of endogenous DNA-polymerase reaction in the presence of three un-
labeled dN'l‘P anda—‘zP-dA'l'P; isolation of DNA and purification thereof were performed
by known methods [3]. Preliminary restriction analysis of viral DNA revealed that
it is wanting in the sites of HindIII, Pstl and EcoPI restrictases. The latter had
been demonstrated in all previously examined DNA of hepatitis virus B and was used to
clone viral DNA. We separated viral DNA with Bamﬂl restrictase, for which two sites
were demonstrated, and we ligated the obtained fragments with DNA of plasmid pBR322
after separating the latter with BamHI and treating it with alkaline phosphatase,
using DNA ligase of Ta phage. After transformation of E. coli RRl cells, clones
were selected with the AprTcs phenotype, while electrophoretic analysis of plasmid
DNA of these clones in agarose gel, both without dissociation and after segregation
of BamHI, enabled us to select clones with plasmids having insertions for the BamHI
site. and their dimensions correspond to Baal fragments of the initial viral DNA.
One of the plasmids, pHBJZO, had an insertion of two 3am"! fragments, and both

were hybridized with 3'2l’-1abeled DNA of hepatitis virus B.

Joint segregation of phB320 DNA and
#‘dd? ’2? DNA of hepatitis virus B by

(aw) " a series of restrictases (Figure l)
is indicative of the fact that the
physical maps of cloned and original
BamHI fragments are identical. Both
the original DNA and inserted DNA in
the pHB320 plasmid contained no EcoRI,
HindIII or PstI sites. In both the
splice and viral DNA, the large Bamﬂl
fragment contains a Xhol site, and it
is at the same distance from Bamhl
sites. The other Bamﬂl fragment con-
tains two BglII sites the relative
position of which is identical in the
original and cloned DNA. The relative

tion by the appropriate restrictases.
made it possible to unequivocally determine the orientation of the splice in the
plasmid (Figure 2).

The DNA of hepatitis virus 3 that we cloned demonstrates a greater resemblance to
the DNA of virus of subtype ayw [12], rather than adw; [13], which is manifeated,
first of all, by the relative location of Bamﬂl, Bglll and xhol sites. The

latter is absent in adwz DNA. The following are absent in the DNA we cloned:

Hrnkl Sit(, which is typical for both subtypes of viral DNA, as well as one of the
sites for humﬂl and Bglll of those present in ayw DNA. A comparison of the physical
maps of pHBJZO DNA and DNA of subtype ayw virus [12] indicates that the fragments
cloned in the Bamul plasmid have the same reciprocal orientation as in the initial
viral DNA.

Separation of pHD320 DNA by BspI and NindII restrictases yields a set of new frag-
ments, which present virtually total resemblance to the DNA we cloned with DNA of

subtype ayu virus. Combined segregation'by these restrictases with BamHI confirms
the orientation of the insert illustrated in Figure 2.

Thus, we succeeded in cloning DNA of hepatitis virus 3 that is the most widespread
in Latvia, since the physical naps of the cloned DNA and major component of DNA
of virus isolated from a combined ["overall"] blood plasma preparation were iden-

tical, and this was found in two independent experiments. Unlike the most popular
procedure for cloning DNA of hepatitis virus 3 using the EcoRI site, we cloned

viral DNA for one of the two Bamﬂl sites, namely, the one located in the single-
slranded segment of DNA [12]. This may be of decisive significance for expression

of HngAg in homologous systems, since the region preceding unsAg remains untouched
with such cloning.

[Text] In spite of the fact that there is distinct reference to a specific host
or narrow group of hosts ofmwst species of fleas, i.e., being specific, the
majority of flea species can breed on various warm-blood animals and even reptiles,
without demonstrating narrow specialization (Darskaya, Besedina, 1961;

Bryukhanova, 1961; Vashchenok et a1., 1976. and others).

loff (1961), who attributed special importance to the specificity of flea feeding,
stressed that the question of their preference for a specific animal species has
not been sufficiently settled. In the opinion of that author, specificity could
be due to the structural distinctions of the piercing part and length of proboscis,
which enables them to pierce skin of a specific thickness, structure of sense
organs and purely external ecological conditions. '

At the same time, it was shown (Hudson and Prince, 1968) that differences in fer—
tility are also demonstrable when fleas sudK blood from representatives of differ—
ent groups of warn—blooded animals. The yield of Pulex irritans imagos per

Eesale can vary by tens of times (8.0 imagos per female per day when feeding on
man, 1.2 when feeding on the guinea pig and 0.5 on the dog). Haas (1965) men-
tionsthe difference in number of offspring that could be obtained from fleas of
the same species that fed on different hosts. Differences have been established
between reproduction of Xenopsylla cheopis and Cerstophyllus fasciatus fleas when
they fed on the golden hamster, white rat and white mouse (Samarina et al., 1968).
Fertility was found to be higher when feeding on the golden hamster than other
hosts. In addition, Alekseyev (1961) demonstrated that Ceratophyllua consimilis
fleas feeding on the ratlike hamster not only deposited more eggs than when they
fed on the white rat and white mouse, but that maturation and oviposition occurred

sooner o

Numerous field observations also revealed that exchange of fleas between different
rodent apecteain their natural habitat is a common phenomenon, particulady'in
areas where there are mixed settlements thereof. It must be assumed that these
distinctions of correlations between parasite and host have a significant influ-
ence on the geographic distribution of fleas, formation of populations, as well

as ouuntity thereof. Herein lies the special theoretical and practical importance
of studying whether different flea species can possible survive and reproduce for
a long period of time on hosts that are not inherent to them. The need for such
studies is attributable to the link between this problem and such questions as
laboratory cultivation and evaluation of the role of fleas as carriers of fleas

in upizootiology and epidemiology.

He submit here the results of comparative observation of reproduction of three
species of fleas as related to feeding on their main lost and hosts that are not
inherent to them.

Material and Methods

He used 5—day-old fleas, which had not eaten after coming out of the cocoon (Xeno-
psylla conformis Hagn., Ceratophyllus laeviceps Wagn., C. tesquorum Wagn.), from
laboratory populations maintained constantly on their main hosts (midday gerbil
for the first two species and little suslik). The reproductive distinctions of
these fleas were studied on the midday gerbil, little suslik, common vole, golden
hamster, white rat, white mouse, guinea pig, rabbit and house sparrow. The fleas
were kept in rectangular glass containers (chamber-jars), on the bottom of which
we spread dry,baked sand with addition of feed for larvae. He placed 2-3 sheets
of lilter paper on the sand to absorb urine of the host, and the cage with an
animal was placed on the paper. There was prevalence of dry feed in the animals'
diet. The fleas were placed on each host in quantities of 60 specimens on each
(45 females and 15 males). The chamber-jars with animals and fleas were then
constantly kept in temperature-controlled boxes ["termoboks"?] where the tempera-
ture was automatically held at 26° and humidity at 75-80%. He took a daily

count of surviving males and females and moved them to a new substrate. The sub-
strate with deposited eggs was kept under the same conditions until imagos hatched.
He kept a record of average offspring per female according to imago yield. He
observed flea fertility for 15-30 days. The experiments were repeated 3-4 times
in each season.

in order to examine feeding activity on different hosts, 5-day-old fleas, which
had not eaten after hatching fromthe cocoon, were weighed, at the rate of 200
por field, on a balance, and groups of 50 fleas were put on the animal. The
insects were combed off the animal after 20, 30, 40 and 60 min; the percentage of
feeding insects was recorded, and determination made of the weight of blood con-
sumed within a specific time spent on the host.

1hc data were submitted to statistical processing according to Kaminskiy (1964).
Results and Discussion

The results of this study indicate that the weight of blood ingested by female and
male fleas is equally independent of the species-specific distinctions of the host,
and in our experiments it ranged from 0.04 to 0.06 mg in female X. conformis,

0.03 to 0.04 mg in male x. conformis; in c. tesquorum it ranged from 0.13 to 0.25 mg
for females and 0.06 to 0.11 mg for males (Table 1).

The time that the insects spent on the host also failed to affect the weight of
blood consumed by one flea. Within the first 20 min, the fleas had ingested as
much blood as specimens that spent 1 h on the animal (Table 2).

At the same tine, there was a reliable difference in feeding activity of fleas on
different Species of hosts. Thus, C. tesquorum ingested blood actively on differ-
cut host species and most specimens were satiated already within 30-40 min. The
images of this species ingested blood faster and in larger amounts on a specific
host. The lowest percentage of fleas that were satiated within both 20 min and

l h was found on the midday gerbil and golden hamster (Table 3). In contrast.

the role of the main host-midday gerbil-in feeding activity was not demonstrable
in x. confornis. The percentage of fleas that fed on the gerbil for the first

20 min and thereafter did not exceed the percentage of fleas feeding on other
hosts. The highest percentage of feeding imagos was established among females

on the white rat (64.0), rabbit (65.0) and common vole (77.0). The percentage

of feeding x. conformis fleas left on other hosts for 1 h was in the range of
22.0-46.0. The number of fleas that sucked blood increased with increase in tine
left on the animals. But, even after being on a host for l h, there was a high

purrentage of fleas that had not yet been satiated in virtually all groups, both
umuuu males and females (33.0-77.7! for females and 62.5-75.0: for males). Accord-
inn In the percentage of feeding specimens, females of both flea Species fed more

acLivuly after hatching from the cocoon than males.

Analysis of flea fertility revealed that x. conformis and C. laeviceps reproduce
better when kept on their main host and the golden hamster, whereas the golden
hamster and white mouse are the best hosts for the c. tesquorum suslik fleas. The
mean duration of development from the time of birth of larvae to hatching of imagos
was 4-5 days shorter when maintained on a nonspecific host. the golden hamster,
than on a specific host. c. tesquorum fleas reproduced worse on the little suslik
under laboratory conditions than on such nonspecific hosts as the golden hamster
and white mouse. Both gerbil and suslik fleas reproduced Poorly on some species

of animals (guinea pig, house sparrow) (Table 4). It is remarkable that there is
a distinct seasonal pattern to reproduction, in spite of the fact that the fleas
were maintained at a stable temperature and humidity throughout the year. Thus,
an increase in fertility of x. conformis was observed in the spring on all host
species. Fertility diminished in the summer and fall months, and increased in

the fall only when kept on their main host and golden hamster (see Figure).

He also failed to demonstrate a significant effect of upkeep conditions on the

Thus, the weight of the initial population of C. laevicepa at the age

or 5 days constituted 0.35:0.01 mg for females and 0.27:0.02 mg for males. First

generation offspring presented the following weight on different hosts: 0.37iU.01
and 0.2710.01, respectively, on the midday gerbil; 0.35:0.02 and 0.26:0.02 on the
golden hamster; 0.3320.01 and 0.2610.02 on the little suslik; 0.3720.04 and 0.25!
0.01 on the white mouse; 0.33:0.01 and 0.26:0.02 on the common vole.

Thus, there is reason to assume that it is not-so much structural distinctions as
physiology and ecological conditions that are significant to feeding and, conse-
qucntly, distinctions of reproduction of fleas when placed on different animal
species. The different species of fleas ingest and assimilate blood from nonspe-
cific animals and, under optimum upkeep conditions, can reproduce on them the year

round. Only differences in fertility are demonstrable as a function of host and
time of year.

Vnshchenok et a1. (1976) demonstrated, on the example of x. cheopis, that fleas
ingest and assimilate the blood of different species of rodents, birds, man and
reptiles; but there are substantial differences in the digestive process. Blood
digesting time is different for different hosts. Digestion of human and golden
hamster blood to hematin takes place in 12-20 h; for blood of the guinea pig and
reptiles the time is 18-25 h, for the white rat and pigeon it is 20-30 h. There

is slower breakdown of bird and reptile erythrocytes than rodent erythrocytes.

This cannot fail to affect reproduction, if we consider that the first intake of
food is the stimulus for development of oocytes up to fertilization in females
(Vushchenok, 1967). This apparently also explains the reproductive distinctions

of fleas feedingonvarious hosts. Samarina et al. (1968) assumes that the obser-
ved differences in fertility are attributable to different sets of amino acids
contained in host blood. But this hypothesis has not yet been verified. Nor can
we rule out the possibility of dependence of flea fertility on presence of hor-
mones. Rothschild and Ford (1964) demonstrated that host corticoid hormones are
required for reproduction of the rabbit's flea (Spillopsyllus cuniculi Dall), since
the ovaries do not mature without them. Such a dependence was demonstrated. though
in a less marked form, in experiments with Xenopsylla astia Rothsch.(Prasad, 1973).

in conclusion, it should be stressed that, on the basis of our findings and data
in the literature, one could refer to relative feeding specialization in such
species of fleas as c. tesquorum, C. laeviceps and X. conformis, in spite of
theirratherhigh specificity. They have greater potential capacity to survive

in mixed rodent populations, since they can feed and reproduce on hosts that are
not inherent in them, which inhabit the same ecological conditions. On this
basis, one should be cautious in making conclusions about indicators of contact
between different rodent species solely on the basis of incidence of fleas on
noninherent hosts. These data may also serve as an indirect indication that

when eradicating the main carrier, as the above-mentioned species of fleas, which
are the main vectors of plague in a number of endemic sites. move to other species

ol animals susceptible to plague, they may not oniy.survive, but participate for
some time in maintaining the epizootic process.

asthma. Major surveys, however, have revealed that morbidity is actually even
higher-7.8 per 1,000 inhabitants (1). The infectious-allergic form is the most
severe manifestation of the disease.

Bacterial allergens have been enjoying extensive use in the treatment of this patho-
logy in recent years. A positive impact has been gained from specific hyposensiti-
cation in an average of 45 percent of patients with the infectious-allergic form of
bronchial asthma (2,11,14,15,19,21.23,25). Subcutaneous and intracutaneous injection
of bacterial allergens is presently the omenly accepted method of immnotherapy for
bronchial estrus. However, various cosplications, which are encountered in 8-20
percent of the cases and which reduce the method's effectiveness, prevent broad
application or this userul method (3,7,12,24).

It is for these reasons that attespts are being made to improve the methods of hypo-
scnsitization. Attemts have been made in specific treatment of hay fever by appli-
cation of pollen antigens to respiratory mucosa (18,22). This method has now
achieved widespread acceptance, since it has a number of advantages over the in-
jection method or treating hay fever (8). Use of. bacterial allergen aerosols is a

further development of. local specific hyposensitiration in the presence of
bronchial asthma.

Infectious-allergic bronchial asthma was definitely diagnosed in 190 patients in the

al lergological ward of the kpublic Clinical Hospital. The specific diagnoses were
made in 1975-1979 by methods cosnmly accepted in clinical allergology: ellergological
anmcsis, skin and provocative tests, immunological tests in vim and so on (10).
This group of patients was dominated by women (61 percent), persons 21-40 years old

(65 percent) , white collar workers (46 percent) and residents of the northern oblasts
of the Kazakh SSR (42 percent). An illness duration or 5-10 years was established

heightened sensitivity was revealed was prepared for the illnunotherapy. Forty per-
cent of the patients received one antigen, ~52 percent received two and 18 percent
received three and more. The therapeutic complexes administered to 38 percent of
the patients contained different strains of Staphylococcus, 32 percent received
Streptococcus, 26 percent received E. coli, 20 percent received Nbisseria, 13 per-
cent received Proteus, 10 percent received Pheuwvcoccus and 3 percent received other
bacteria. Bacterial therapeutic antigens were employed (provided by the Kazan'
Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology): from apathogenic
Staphylococcus aursus, hemolytic Staphylococcus, group pneunooocoal allergen, hemo-
lytic Streptococcus, Proteus mimbilis, E. 00112. Bacillus pyocymzeus, Neisseria. etc.
These antigens have been available in the pharmaceutical network for many years.

lhc number of inhalations depended on the initial dose, which was determined by
allergometric titration on respiratory tract mucosa (49 percent of the patients
received 10-20 inhalations while 39 percent received 21-30). The treatment method

the aggravated state and clearing of infection foci. During hyposensitization with
bacterial allergen aerosols, the patient was not subjected to other treatment methods.
Treatment effectiveness was evaluated on the basis of special questionnaires con-
taining 15 questions, which the patient answered during his follow-up examination.

A score of 1 meant subjective and objective worsening of state following treatment,

breathing: 4 meant rare and mild attacks of labored breathing that were easily
curtailed by drugs without referral to a physician; 5 meant absence of attacks and
complaints.

Results and Discussion

immunotherapy (Table l). The ' 'me of remission following imunotherapy was up to

1 month for 16 percent of the patients, up to 3 months for 18 percent. up to 6 months
for 22 percent, up to 1 year for 18 percent and up to 2 years for 26 percent: it
averaged 8.3 months.

Analysis of aggravations of bronchial asthma and conplications accompanying specific
therapy showed that aerosol therapy is accoepanied by significantly fewer pathologi-

skin allergic tests were performed before and after treatment with several bacterial
allergens: thus we were able to observe the decrease in sensitivity in relation to
both specific antigens (used in the therapy) and nonspecific antigens (not used in
the therapy of the given patient). We found that following treatment with bacterial
allergen aerosols. highly positive and positive skin tests with allergens used in
the therapy (specific) decreased five times more frequently than in relation to
nonspecific allergens (Table 3).

The neutrophil damage indicator (NDI) is an objective indicator of the body's sensi-
tization to bacterial allergens. It reflects the dynamics of sensitization in the
bodies of patients with respiratory allergosis undergoing treatment with bacterial
antigens (6.16). Analysis of the results (Table 4) showed that following aerosol

therapy the NDI became normal in 21 percent of patients with infectious-allergic
bronchial asthma, while following the injection method of treatment the ND]: became
normal in 32 percent of the patients. The nunber of patients with a dramatically
enlarged NDI following treatment by the injection method decreased by 22 percent,
while for patients receiving aerosol therapy the figure was only 7 percent.

Sensitivity of the bronchi to bacterial allergens following specific treatment,

as determined by a provocative test, is an important indicator of the effectiveness
of aerosol therapy in patients with bronchial astl'na. He studied the dynamics of

the sensitivity of bronchi to both specific and nonspecific antigen. The frequency
of sensitivity to specific bacterial allergens (a positive provocative test) de-
creased from 100 percent (prior to treatment) to 55 percent (after treatment)--that
is, in 45 percent of the patients. To analyze the decline in sensitivity to non-
specific antigens, we used the same allergens frm the Kazan' Scientific Research
Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology which we used in our research on specific
reactions. The frequency of sensitivity in relation to nonspecific antigen de-
creased from 48 to 39 percent--that is, in only 9 percent of the patients. According
to data from allergometric titration, the threshold of sensitivity of the bronchi of
most patients (76 percent) prior to treatment was within 10'8 and 10’5 allergen
dilutions, the average being 6.3104. Following treatment it increased for most
patients (71 percent) to lO"°-l<)'2 allergen dilutions, the average being 35120.1.
Thus following treaunent with aerosols containing bacterial allergens the sensitivity
of bronchi to specific antigen decreased by an average of three orders of magnitude,
while their sensitivity to nonspecific antigen decreased by an average of one order
of magnitude.

Hypergamglobulinemia associated with antibody formation is observed in the presence
of allergic diseases. Therefore we studied the protein fractions of blood serum from
patients with bronchial asthma before and after aerosol therapy using bacterial
allergens (Table 5). Prior to treatment the total quantity of protein and albumins
and the albumin-globulin coefficient (M6) were low. Following specific therapy we

did not reveal significant changes in the proteinogram of peripheral blood; nor did
the sedimentation rate change.

Blood lymphocytes and eosinophils play an important role in the development of
allergic inflamtion and in the mechanisms of specific therapy. Introduction of

bacterial allergens into patients suffering infectious allergy is accompanied by
change in the white blood formula (5). The peripheral blood of bronchial astlmla

17

.mtin-nts was characterized prior to treatment by leukocytosis in 24 percent of
the patients, eosinophilia in 32 percent and lymphocytosis in 12 percent. The re-
maining for-ed blood elements were within normal. Following imnotherapy using

bacterial allergens, a decrease in the quantity of leukocytes and fluctuations in
the quantities of eosinophils and lymphocytes were noted (Table 6).

In this case the direction and magnitude of changes in lymphocytes and eosinophils
in reSponse to inhalational and injection therapy differed. With the inhalation
method the quantity of eosinophils in peripheral blood increased while the quantity
of lymphocytes decreased. with the injection method, the changes in response to
introduction of the allergens were opposite.

The principal sysptom of bronchial asthn is bronchospam, which can be objectively
recorded by spirography. The most informative indicators of external respiration
are lung vital capacity (INC), which is expressed as a percentage of normal we,
the l-second forced lung vital capacitynnvc (in liters), the ratio between PLVC
and 1M: (percent) or the 'riffno coefficient ('l'C) , the exhalation force determined by
pnetmotachometry (Pm) (liters/sec) and maximum lung ventilation-4M! (percent).
We studied the dynamics of external respiration in bronchial asthna patients before
and after treatment with bacterial allergen aerosols. Following treatment with
bacterial antigen aerosols, positive changes indicating a tendency toward normali-
zation of bronchial passability were noted. however, the difference was physically
insignificant (Table 7).

Glucocorticoid insufficiency is a foundation for development of allergic diseases
(13). The total quantity of_corticostsroids and the products of their netaboliem
in urine--l7-ketosteroids (l7-Ks).--is an objective indicator of the state of the
adrenal cortex. Prior to treatment the concentration of l7-KS in daily urine

of our patients was 10.773035 mg, or somewhat below normal. Following treatment
with bacterial allergen aerosols their quantity decreased to 8.25:0. 62 mg.

The reaction of specific convicted phagocytosis described by Bernen et a1. (4)
reflects the dynamics of specific insanity in patients with bronchial «than. we
studied the phagocytic activity of leukocytes-4M. (percent), the am: of phage-
cytosed microbial bodies per active neutrophiluthe digestion index (DI) , the percent
completed phagocytosis (PCP) and the percent neutrophils in which all microbial cells
are killed using smears taken before and after specific treatment with bacterial
allergens. we established that following treatment with bacterial antigens, patients
exhibit higher specific imunity to Streptococcus; in this case immunity was signi-
ficantly greater following aerosol therapy (Table 8).

We studied conditionally pathogenic flora vegetating in respiratory tract mucosa of
bronchial asthma patients. Prior to imunotherapy with bacterial allergen aerosols
various strains of Staphylococcus were cultured in samples from 35 percent of the
patients, Proteus strains were detected in samples from 1 percent, Streptococcus
strains were detected in samples from 3 percent and E. coli strains were determined
in samples from 50 percent of the patients. Following treatment these indicators
hardly changed at all, being 32, 2, 6 and 1 percent respectively (their differences
are statistically insignificant).

indicating that the course of therapy mat be repeated in 1 year. A clinically
detectable iaproveaent in the state of patients is accompanied by a decrease in
sensitivity of all body systems to specific bacterial allergens, as determined from

data). Absence of changes in the proteinogram emphasizes the local mechanism of
aerosol innunotherapy. The completed phagocytosis reaction revealed an increase
in specific iumunity following aerosol therapy. Hyposensitization by aerosols
containing bacterial antigens was found to be highly specific.

The difference between the injection and aerosol methods of innunotherapy is con-
firmed by different directions in the changes experienced by the quantity of cells
in white blood following treatment, especially the quantity of lyuphocytes. The
aerosol method of immxotherapy has almost no effect on pathogenic flora in the
respiratory tract. Nor were biologically active miner-histamine, serotonin and
acetylcholine--found to participate in the mechanism of hyposensitization by

bacterial aerosols. At the same time inmmotherapy using bacterial antigens
cliCits slight changes in glucocorticoid metabolism.

Presence of a local defense system in the mucosa of the respiratory tract has now
been established, based on secretory 19A. ‘me mechanism behind the localrinfluence
of bacterial vaccines is now being studied. The decrease in sensitivity of the mucosa
is apparently associated with blockage of microbes and viruses entering from without.
with lgA and with stimulation of T-suppressors (17,20).

Conc lus ions

1. Use of aerosols containing bacterial allergens for specific treatment of the
infectious-allergic form of bronchial asthma produced good and excellent results

in 55 percent of the patients.

2. The effectiveness of local imunotherapy was greater than that of the injection
method of introducing the allergens, and it was accoupanied significantly less
frequently by vaccine reactions and by complications on the part of various organs
and systems.

3. Analysis of the tests run in this project showed that the positive effect of
treatment is the product of a decline in hypersensitivity and a rise in inunity

mainly of the respiratory tract mucosa--that is, hyposensitization of the organ
subjected to shock occurred.

{Text} we submit here the results of processing'pelagic cephalopods gathered
during the 50th (April-July 1971) and 57th (February-May 1975) voyages aboard

the Vityaz' [ship]. A variable depth Isaacs-Kidd trawl was the main equipment
used to collect nesopelagic and bathypelsgic species during both voyages; surface
water species were caught with a scoop, metal lures [fish-shaped], pleustonic and
neustonic trawls. Plankton and cephalopods were also caught in benthonic fishing
gear when hoisted to the surface.

During the 50th voyage, work was conducted in four areas, where many days were
spent, and several short-tern stations to the north and south of the Caroline
Islands, in the Sulu and New Guinea seas. The variable-depth trawl was used

for fishing down to a depth of 500 m over divided water lines. During the 57th
voyage, work was done in two meridional sections, approximately along the 127-128°
and 142—1hh° parallel, east longitude, from the islands of Okinawa and Bonin to
the equatorial region, as well as in the Sulawesi, Sulu. Flores, Banda, Seram,
"almahera and New Guinea waters and in the region of the Mariana Islands. Trawling
was conducted at levels of 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 1350-1500 m. During both voyages,
trawling was done at night. In all, there were 171 trawlings in 35 sites. The
material provides a full enough idea about the fauna of oceanic cephalopods of

the western tropical part of the Pacific Ocean, from-Kuroshiotn the equator and
from the Philippines to 150° east longitude, Indonesian and Philippine seas. The
distribution of cephalopods in the northern extratropical and eastern tropical
parts of the Pacific has been described previously (Neais, 1973a, b).

During these voyages, many cephalopod species were found, which were either new

or not previously known in this region. A new genus and species of Seniolidae

was found in the Halmahera Sea, which is referable to a new subfamily. New
species were discovered of the genera Chiroteuthoides and Tankaia (Chiroteuthidae
family) and Hastigoteuthis (Hastigoteuthidae family). For the first time since

it was originally described, we found Chiroteuthis famelica Berry, 1909, which

had to be put in a special genus of the Chiroteuthidae family. The following were

luund for the first time in the Pacific: Enoploteuthis anaspis Roper, E. Leptura
(Leach) (new subspecies), Octopoteuthis megaptera (Verrill), Octopoteuthis n. sp.
Nexis, Brachioteuthis picta Chun, Cycloteuthis akinushkini Pilippova, Chiroteuthis
joubini Voss (?), Hastigoteuthis glaukopis Chun, M. atlantica Joubin, Egea inennis
Joubin, and for the first tine in the western Pacific: Heteroteuthis cf. hawaiiensis
Berry,* Iridoteuthis iris (Berry), Bathyteuthis sbyssicola Hoyle, Discoteuthis discus
Young and Roper (?), "chiroteuthis" famelics Berry, Valbyteuthis oligobessa Young,
Mastigoteuthis dentata Hoyle, as well as Lepidoteuthia»grimaldii.Joubin, which had
been previously known in the southwestern part of this ocean.

The catches taken during the 50th voyage yielded 37 oceanic and nerito-oceanie
speciesandduring the 57th--75 species. All of the species but one of those caught
during the 50th voyage were also represented in the catches of the 57th voyage.
Thus. the collection under study numbers 76 species.

The area of our investigation is situated entirely in the tropical zone, and it is
only in the extreme north, hitheKuroshio region, that species were encountered
that are not inherent in the tropics—-periphera1 and subtropical-south boreal. The
species we encountered can be divided into six zoogeographic complexes: 1) those
distributed over the entire area studied—~broadly tropical; 2) those distributed

in the equatorial and central waters, but not encountered in the Japan Current—-
narrowly tropical; 3) those encountered in the equatorial and Kuroshio region, but
not central waters; 4) those encountered only in the equatorial zone: a-—everywhere,
b—-In the Indonesian and Philippine seas, but not in the open sea, c-only in the
open sea; 5) distributed in central waters; 6) distributed in waters of the Japan
Current (and north of it).

There are not many broadly tropical species, but most of them are represented on

a mass scale. This group includes Abralia andananica Goodrich, Pyroteuthis marga-
ritiiora(Ruppell).0nykia carriboea Lesueur, Onychoteuthis banksi banksi (Leach),
Chiruteuthis picteti Joubin (- chiroteuthis imperator Chun), Sandalops melancholicus
Chun. Of these, 0. carriboea and 0. banksi are circuntropical, P. margaritifera and
S. melancholicus are Atlantic-Indo-Hest Pacific, Ch. picteti is Indo-Hest Pacific,
A. onuamanica is an Indo-Pacific species. The range of 0. carriboea, 0. banksi

and A. nndamanica in the Pacific is primarily equatorial-west central, narrowing
down in the east and widened in the west. '

Among the species distributed in the equatorial and central waters, we can mention
Hnoploteuthis anaspis Roper, Histioteuthis hoylei (Coodrich)(- H. dofleini). Sthe-
noteuthis oualaniensis (Lesson). Crnnchia seabra Leach, Liocranchia reinhardti
(Steeustrup), Helicocranchia pfefferi Messy, Corynonma abyssicola (Goodrich). Most
are also numerous. h. hoylei, C. scabra, L. reinhardti and H. pfefferi are circum-
troplnal, E. anaspis is an Atlantic-Indo-west Pacific species, 8. oualaniensis and
C. nbysaicola are Indo-Pacific. The range of most species is also narrowed down
in the eastern part of the ocean: S. oualaniensis. L. reinhardti and c. abyssicola
are absent from the California and Peruvian currents, and there is no C. seabra in
the Peruvian one; only H. hoylei and H. pfefferi are more widely distributed. All
of those species, with the exception of B. anaspis, have been reported in the
waters of Kuroshio and near Japan (Nesis, 1973a; Shevtsov, 1969; Okutani, 1967).
Absence thereof from our catches in the region of the Japan Current indicates that

*ueteroteuthis sp., discovered by Japanese researchers (Uotani, Ohara, 1974) near
the Byukyu Islands, is apparently referable to this species.

they are encountered there, but not continuously, being either passively carried
from time to time into the Kuroshio from tropical waters or, like 5. oualaniensis,
migrating actively there for feeding.

“any species were encounteredin equatorial waters and Kuroshio region, but they
avoid central waters, or at least the most oligotrophic parts of the Philippine

Sea ("peripheral-equatorial" species). This applies to Pterygioteuthis giardi
Fischer, Ctenopteryx sicula (Verany), Histioteuthis meleagroteuthis (Chua), Disco-
teuthis discus Young et Roper (7), Hastigoteuthis dentats Hoyle, H. atlantica Joubin,
Beloneila belone (Chun) (- B. pacifica pacifica Nesis), Galiteuthis pacifica (Rob-
son), Vampyroteuthis infernalis Chun, Japetella diaphana Hoyle. It also includes
nerito-oceanic species--Heteroteuthis cf. hawaiiensis Berry and Ornithoteuthis
volutilis Sasaki. They are in the benthonic region during the reproductive period,
so that there absence from the middle of the Philippine Sea is understandable; they
are also absent in the eastern part of the ocean. As for oceanic species, P.
giardl, C. sicula,-H. meleagroteuthis, D. discus, B. belone, V. infernalis and J.
diaphana are circumtropical, H. atlantica is presumably Atlant-Indo-Uest Pacific,
M. dentata and G. pacifica are Pacific or, more probably, Indo-Pacific. There are
few species represented in large number in this group. Seven out of 10 species
were reported near Japan, while 3 even reach the latitude of the Kuril Islands
(Nesis. 1973a). The range of P. giardi, D. discus and C. sicula is rather narrow
iJItheeastern part of the ocean, and it does not reach the California and Peruvian
'currents, while the others are widely distributed. Their absence or scarcity in
central waters is unrelated to hydrological barriers. The bathypelagic species

in this group (H. atlantica, M. dentata, V. infernalis, J. diaphana) perhaps
inhabit central waters below depths of 1350-1500 I (bottom range of our catches),
although this is unlikely, since their habitat range does not usually go deeper than
700—800 m. Host probably, they avoid central waters because of the shortage of
food there.

(ﬁnite a few species were not encountered beyond equatorial waters. Most are found
hlbuththe Pacific Ocean and Australian and Asia seas: Enoploteuthis 1eptura(Leach),
Ahraliopsis lineata (Goodrich), Ancistrocheirus alessandrinii (Verany), Octopo-
teuthis megaptera (Verrill), Bathyteuthis bacidifera Roper, Histioteuthis celetaria
(G. Voss), Valbyteuthis oligobessa Young, Bathothauma lyromma Chun. Only two of
these, A. alessandrinii and B. lyromma, are circumtropical, E. leptura, 0. megap-
Lera and H. celetaria are Atlantic-Indo-Hest Pacific (3. leptura and H. celetaria
are represented by other subspecies in the Atlantic'than in the Indo-Hest Pacific
region), A. lineata is Indo-West Pacific, B. bacidifera and presumably V. oligo-
bessa are Indo-Pacific species.

B. lyromma penetrates rather far to the north in the northwestern part of the
Pacific and south in the southeastern part, and probably it is not strictly limited
tn equatorial waters. 0f the other species, only A. alessandrinii reaches the
coast of southern Japan, while A. lineata is encountered in Kuroshio (Shevtsova,
1975; Okutani, 1967; Yamamoto, Okutani, 1975). The species present in the eastern
part of the ocean do not travel beyond equatorial waters (with the exception of B.
iyromna).

The equatorial species discovered only in Indonesian and Philippine seas, or only
in the open part of the Pacific, are most often too few in number to define their
range with certainty. The nerito-oceanic species, Spirula spirula (L.), which

25

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

is distributed in the Atlantic and lndo-Hest Pacific and does not go beyond the
range of areas with closed circulation of intermediate waters (Bruun, 19‘3), was
vnrnuntered only in inland seas. Bathyteuthis abyssicola Hoyle was not encountered
in inland seas; the distribution of this species in the tropical parts of oceans is
closely related to the distribution of subantarctic intermediate waters (Roper.
1969; Nesis, 1974). The Indo-Hest Pacific Abraliopsis hoylei hoylei (Pfeffer) and
Argonnuta boettgeri Maltzan were also not encountered in inland seas. However.
they both penetrate to the shores of Japan and are widely distributed in the Japan
Current; their areal distribution in the western part of the Pacific resembles the
distribution of equatorial-west-central species.

Pterygioteuthis gemmata Chun, Hyaloteuthis pelagica (Bose), "Chiroteuthis" famelica
Berry, Liocranchia valdiviae Chun, Liguriella sp. and larvae of Onychoteuthidae,
tentatively classified as chaunoteuthis mollis Appellof, were encountered only in
ventral waters. 0n the northern periphery of central waters, there were Joubini-
teuthis portieri (Joubin) and Leachia pacifica (Issel). Brachioteuthis behni
(Steenstrup) (- B. riisei auct. pt, non Steenstrup) larvae were caught in central
waters and Kuroshio. P. gammata is distributed in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian
oceans, its range is bicentral-east equatorial in the Atlantic and northcentrai-
south-peripheral in the Pacific (Nesis, 1973a, 1974). H. pelagica and Liguriella
5p. are tentatively defined as bicentral species, but in the East Pacific H. pelagica
enters equatorial waters (Zuyev et al., 1975). The lndo-Pacific species, L. valdi-
viue in the Indian and east Pacific oceans is also often encountered in equatorial
waters (Shevtsov, 1973; Clarke, 1966; Okutani, 1974).

There are close relatives of P. gemmata and L. valdiviae among the widely tropical
species P. giardi and L. reinhardti. P. giardi ismuch more scarce in the region
studied than in the East Pacific, it inhabits waters of the Kuroahio system and is
also encountered in the Sulu and Bands seas. but is not found in central waters. L.
reinhardti is represented in very large numbers over the entire tropical zone of

the Pacific Ocean, but is less abundant in central waters than equatorial ones.
Perhaps the presence of P. gemmata and L. valdiviae in central waters is attri-
butable to their competitive separation in close waters. L. valdiviae and L.
reinhardti also differ in depth of habitat: L. reinhardti is encountered mainly

at above 1000 m and L. valdiviae at deeper levels.

Previously, J. portieri had been found only once in the Pacific near southern Japan.
8. behni and L. pacifica are numerous in Kuroshio and its southern periphery
(Shevtsuv, 1969; Uotani, Ohara, 1974; Yamamoto, Okutani, 1975), but scarce near
Japan; it is impossible to analyze their distribution because of taxonomic difficul-
ties (Ncsis, 1973b; Okutani, 1976).

He encountered the following species only in the waters of Kuroshio: Enoploteuthia
chuni Ishikaua, Abraliopsis sp. cf. falco Young (Abraliopsis type "a" of Shevtsov,
1975), Ianingia danae Joubin, Todarodes pacificus Steenstrup (only larvae), 0mma-
strephes bartrami (Lesueur), Eucleoteuthis luminosa (Sasaki), Cycloteuthis akimush-
kini Filippovn, Amphitretus pelagicus pelagicus Hoyle. Two types--I. danae and C.
nklnushkini-of other parts of the lndo-Pacific region are encountered in the
tropics, and there is probably only a Seeming coincidence of finding them in

the Japan Current. A. pelagicus in the West Pacific overtly avoids the tropics,
but it is distributed in equatorial waters of the Indian and East Pacific oceans
(There, 1909; Nesis, 1973a, b). The other species are definitely not tropical.

E. chuni and T. pacificus are nerito-oceanic, subtropical-south boreal species

distributed in the northwestern Pacific and adjacent seas. E. luminosa is bi-
peripherai in the Pacific and southern-peripheral in the Atlantic and Indian oceans.
0. bartrami is a bicentral species, which is distributed in the North Pacific on
the northern periphery of central waters, Kuroshio, the North-Pacific drift,
California current and region of shifting of subtropical and subarctic waters
(Nesis, 1973a; Zuyev et al., 1975). The range of Abraliopsis sp. cf. faleo was

not determined; perhaps, this is a peripheral species.

The other species are sporadically distributed in the area; they do not present a
clearcut picture and are not included in the above-listed groups.

The distribution of geographic groups of oceanic and nerito-oceanic cephalopods in
the waters studied was determined only with consideration of their incidence

in the studied region. The map (see Figure) shows the sites where the following
species were found: 1) Equatorial species distributed in the Pacific and Austro-
Asian seas: Enoploteuthis leptura, Abraliopsis lineata, Ancistrocheirus alessandrinii,
Octopoteuthis megaptera. Bathyteuthis bacidifera, Histioteuthia celetaria, Brachio-
teuthis pitta, Valbyteuthis oligobessa, Bathothauma lyronna. 2) Equatorial species
encountered inthe open sea: Abraliopsis hoylei, Abraliopsis n. sp. (= A. morisi

Chun, non Verany, part.), Bathyteuthis abyssicola, Lepidoteuthis grinaldii,

Argonauts boettgeri. 3) Species encountered in central waters: Pterygioteuthis
genuata, "Chaunoteuthis moliis," "Chiroteuthis" famelica, Liocranchia valdiviae.

a) Nontropical species encountered in theKnroshiozone: Enoploteuthis chuni, Unmas-
Lrephes bartrami, Eucleoteuthis luminosa. 5) Species encountered on the periphery

of central waters and Kuroshio region, but seen in the tropics in other parts of

the ocean: Joubiniteuthis portieri, Leachia pacifica, Amphitretus pelagieus, as

well as Abraliopsis sp. cf. falco, the exact range of which has not yet been defined.

The distribution of the above-listed species shows that there are three latitude
zones: equatorial, northcentral (tropical proper) and peripheral (northern aub-
tropical) with wide strips of nixed fauna approximately along 10 and 25° north
latitude. Unfortunately, we had no specimens from the extreme western part of

the Philippine Sea, north of 15° north latitude, but undoubtedly there is a
"corridor" along the western edge_of the Philippine Sea that links the equatorial
zone to the peripheral one: Taiwan Current, which then goes into the Japan Current.
ﬂnny equatorial species travel over this "corridor" into the Japan Stream, bypassing
central waters (McGowan, 1971).,

The north subtropical (peripheral) zone is populated by mixed fauna; broadly tro-
pical species and those distributed in Kuroshio and equatorial waters are con-
stant inhabitants thereof. From time to time, equatorial species pass there also.
The northern boundary of this zone traverses the Sea of Japan, Honshu and Cali-
fornia; boreal species penetrate into the northern part of this zone (Nesis. 1973a;
Okutani, 1968; Young, 1972). On the map of zoogeographic regions of the North
Pacific (Nesis, 1973s), the boundary between the northern subtropical and tropical
zone in the open part of the ocean is shownlvae considerably narrower than

ensues from the data submitted above. In actuality, it is a wide band occupying
the entire southern half of the peripheral zone.

There are virtually no species inherent solely in the peripheral zone. Among
cephalopods, only Eucleoteuthis luminosa (Zuyev et al., 1975) is reliably linked
with it. This zone is a typical ecotone.

The above zoogeographic partition of the western tropical part of the Pacific

Ocean according to cepha1opods is similar to its separation according to zooplank—
um (Bek1cuishev, 1969; Geynrilch, 1975; McGowan, 1970) and fish (Parin, 1968). It
differs from phytogeographic division (Semina, 1976) in that there is no protrusion
of the equatorial zone in the western part of the ocean. In the west of the studied
region, northcentral species penetrate rather far to the south, up to the southern
part of Mindanao Island, but we failed to observe passage into the southern henis-
phere, or penetration of southcentral species into the northern hemisphere. Pro-
bably, the northcentral species can penetrate only into the Solomon and New

Guinea seas, and then only in insignificant number, just like they seldom penetrate
in the Atlantic from the south to the windward Islands of the Lesser Antiiies

(Nosis, I975).

The region we studied is referable to the lndo-Hest Pacific geographic tropical
region. There are no species in common with the East Pacific region among nerito-
oceanic species, whereas among oceanic species, for which zonal ranges are typical,
there are fewer in common than species in common with the Atlantic. 0f the 70
definitely identified species found during the 50th and 57th voyages, 62-65 (60-6‘1)
are also encountered in the Atlantic Ocean and 39-60 (56-57!) are encountered in

the tropical East Pacific. The difference between fauna of the Nest and East
Pacific is attributable more to the paucity of East Pacific fauna, than to the
uniqueness of the latter. There are only six endemic species that do not pene-
trate to the west in the tropical East Pacific: Enoploteuthis sp. Okutani, Abraliop-
sis affinis (Pfeffer), A. falco Young, Histioteuthis heteropsis (Berry), Valby-
teuthis danae Joubin, Dreehselia danae Joubin and one more mainly south-tropical
species, Dosidicus gigas (d'Orbigny). The range of Neoteuthis sp. Young was not
determined. Octopoteuthis nielseni (Robson) is apparently cosmopolitan. 0n the
other hand, we encountered 22 Indo-Hest Pacific and Atlantic-Indo-Hest Pacific
species in the West Pacific that were absent from the eastern part of the ocean,

but in all there are more than 30 such species. The differences in total number
of species in the tropical Rest and East Pacific are not great, however, since a
considerable number of nontropical species penetrate from the south and north into
the tropics in the eastern part of the ocean (Nesis, 1973a, b, 1975). Northern
species travel south up to 20' north latitude and southern ones travel north up

to 5° South latitude. In the western part of the ocean, however, the entire tropical
zone from the north tropic to the south is virtually free of nontropical species.

Conclusions

1. The following zoogeographic complexes of oceanic and nerito-oceanic cephalopods
are distributed in the tropical western part of the Pacific Ocean, between the

Ryukyu and Bonin islands, in the Indonesian and Philippine seas: widely tropical,
narrowly tropical (equatorial-central), equatorial, central, widely tropical that
nvoid central waters and nontropical (inhabiting the peripheral zone and north ofit).

2. The widely tropical species that are distributed in the equatorial zone and
Kuroshio system apparently avoid central waters because of the oligotrophic nature
of these waters. The distribution of some central species is probably attribu-
table to competition with similar widely tropical species that avoid central waters.

3. A considerable part of the narrowly tropical and some equatorial species some-
timws penetrate into the Kuroshio region and come up to Japan over the Taiwan
Current "corridor."

4. in the tropical West Pacific, between Japan and the equator, there are three
Zongrnphic latitude zones: northern subtropical (peripheral), northern central
(tropical proper) and equatorial, that are connected by strips of mixed fauna

at about 25 and 10° north latitude. The northern subtropical (peripheral) zone
Is an ecotone with mixed fauna and negligible number of specific species.

S. The differences between the fauna of the tropical West and East Pacific are
attributable more to the paucity of the East Pacific fauna (7 endemic species)
than the uniqueness of this fauna (there are more than 30 species of the west
Pacific that are absent from the East Pacific), and as a result the fauna of

the tropical west Pacific has more species in common with the Atlantic than with
the East Pacific.

[Text] The invention is related to devices for feeding a high-mlecular compound
onto a wetted surface of a body noving in water to reduce its drag and can be used
in equipment involved in reducing the drag of objects in water.

A device is kmwn for reducing the drag of a torpedo containing a forward-drained
streamlined body and internal circular cavity filled with a high-molecular com-
pound. The high-molecular ooupound is in the torn of plates around which flows
sea water. However. when investigating the drag of bodies using a high-molecular
compound in the form of a pro-prepared solution, the use of the known device is
impossible since the internal cavity and its housing are made in the tors: of a
true channel.

The purpose of. the invention is to simlify the design of the device and tests when
using a high-molecular conpound in the form of s pro-prepared solution.

The proposed device is distinguished by the fact that the internal cavity in it is
made in the form of a cylinder coaxial with the body in which a piston joined to
a tow rope passing through a neutral opening in the bow part of the body is
installed. .

The proposed device is shown in the,drawing.

The device has a body 1, inside which is a, cylindrical cavity 2 restricted on one
side by the bow part 3 and on the other by a piston 4. The voluee of the cavity
is filled with a high-molecular ooqaound 5 in the for- of a pie-prepared solution.
There are drain holes 6 and a pull rope 7 passing through opening 8 and connected
to piston 4 and drive 9 in the bow part of the body.

The body 1 is shifted with respect to the piston 4 and forces out the high-noiec-
ular compound 5 which envelopes the body of the device through the drain openings

6 when the device moves in the eaperiesntal nethod behind rope 7 due to the force
created by the pulling action.

[Text] The invention is related to shipbuilding. -

h’ydrowave devices of a III-wing floating platforn are known. for example, ships con-
taining external and internal flexible shells between which are installed elastic
components. However, they have high hydrodynamic drag.

To reduce hydrodynamic drag, each of the elastic cosponents is nade in the fern of a
scale-like spring-loaded lever and rack articulately connected to each other and in
this case the scale-like lever and rack rest on external and internal flexible
shells, respectively, while the lever spring is installed along the hull of the
ship. -

The described device is shown schematically in profile in Figure l, a view along
arrow A in Figure l is shown in Figure 2, a view along arrow B in Figure l is
shown in Figure 3 and the device in a working coepartnent is shown in Figure 4.

The scale-like lever l of the device is connected by means of spring 2 and hinge 3
to support 4 and in this case the upper end of lever l interacts with the external
flexible shell 5. The support 3 is attached to an internal flexible shell 6. The
device is attached by soldering of the internal shell 6 to the hull 7 of a moving
body, for ample, a ship (not shown in the figure). A wave 8 flows against the
external shell when the ship moves.

The wave of fluid 8 flows in when the ship moves, creating pressure on the external
elastic shell 5 and flexing it to a different depth. The surface of the scale-like
lever 1 receives the pressure of the wave a and is lowered. rotating in the hinge

3 on support 4. The other end of the scale-like lever is raised and releases
spring 2. The spring stores potential energy. This operating stroke of the de-
vice perform the function of a notor. The potential energy of the spring will be
converted to the kinetic energy of nation of the support 4, the internal shell 6
and of the ship when the spring is released. This operating stroke performs the
function of an ineller. Spring 2 is compressed when wave 8 flows in. interacting
with one and through the scale-like lever l and the external elastic shell 5 with

the fluid 8. ‘Ihe second end of the spring is held by the support 3. During flexing
of the external elastic shell, the second end of the scale-like lever is separated
from the support and releases the spring. During release of the spring the support
moves in the direction opposite to compression. The spring is released and com-
pressed to an equal length with respect to the dimensions of the ship, but the
release of the spring will occur on a larger section of the linear path than cow
pression with respect to the linear path of the ship set in motion by the main
impeller.

The device operates when a wave moves along the external elastic shell 5. If
static pressure acts on the external elastic shell, uniformly flexing it, the de-
vice does not operate. Joining the voter to the impeller cbes not require addi-
tional designs and accordingly additional energy.

Object of the Invention

A hydrowave device of a moving floating platform, for example. a ship containing
external and internal flexible shells between which are installed elastic compon-
ants, is distmgughed in that, to reduce hydrodynamic drag, each of the elastic

components is made in the form of a scale-like spring-loaded lever and support at-
ticuletely connected to each other and in this case the scale-like lever and sup-
port are connected to external and internal shells, respectively, while the spring
of the lever is installed along the hull of the ship.

DELTA MODULATING MODEL OF RECEPTION

24 Apr 80) pp 89-91

[Article by G. D. Dets']

[Text] It is known that an adequate model makes it possible to effectively study
the object modeled, reduces organizational and cost-related difficulties in
setting up experiments and, in a number of instances. increases significantly
knowledge about the modeled object.

in this article, an attempt is made to simulate a biological receptor-sensor by
means of a well-known and rather fully studied [1, 2] device, a delta modulator
(DH). The proposed model is intended for simulating the electrical activity of a
receptor as a reaction to an exogenous stimulus. The qualitative similarity of
elementary receptor reactions in objects differing in organization [3, 4], enables
us to disregard the specific physical nature_and origin of the modeled receptor.
PrOper coincidence of time plots (sequences of DH output pulses) and_the modeled
receptor to structurally similar input perturbances served as a criterion of ade-
quacy of the model.

There are neurophysiological data [4] indicating that most perceptive processes are
organized.by the principle of tracking systems. This circumstance, as well as the
fact that the electrical component of a nerve fiber's reaction to an'exogenous
stimulus is manifested discretely [3, A], in the form of separate short impulses

of about the same amplitude with modulation of duration of intervals between im-
pulses, enabled us to propose a delta modulating model of reception. The model

we shall describe reflects the real electrical reaction of a receptor more fully
than the well-known "frequency modulating" model [3].

Figure 1 illustrates the block diagram of the DH. Comparator 1 with a hysteretic
two-level input-output characteristic has direct and inverse inputs, as well as
two outputs-informationai, which is connected to the input of key 2, and a
control one, which controls the key through lag element 3. The output of key2
is connected by n diode 4 to local integrator 5. The output of the integrator

is shunted with resistor RP and connected to the comparator's inverse input. In-
put action [perturbance] (voltage U1 in the model) is fed into the comparator
input. Key 2 closes the circuit for a relative brief time, during which capaci-
tance c is charged through resistor R1 and diode 4 in the eventa high potential
is established at the comparator output. The circuit for discharge of capacitance
C is formed by resistor RP' Diode 4 serves to separate the circuits for charge

37

and discharge of capacitance c. The signal is taken on the recording device
(usrlllogrnph, automatic recorder) from the output of the key.

  
 

Figure 2.

Figure 2 illustrates the time plots of
DH function in typical modes. Figure
2a illustrates the diagram of the
external perturbance [input action].
The staggered nature of the test has
been used in many studies of neurophy-
siologists [3, a] and in engineering
practice. Figure 2b shows the output
reaction (U0) of the DH to an input
signal. Figure 2c shows voltage Uc
formed on capacitance C by the solid
line; U, is the averaged value of Uc.

The DH works over the established level
in time interval '1‘; -t3- t]. The
time structure of the pulse sequence in

Figure 3. this interval coincides with spontaneous
discharges [3, 4] of a resting nerve
fiber.

Stepped [staggered] perturbance in interval T3 - t, - t2 elicits the typical DH
reavtion: at first, the output pulses are frequent, then the intervals between them
increase. If interval T2 is long enough, the DH will change to the mode of track-
lug the new established level. In neurophysiological categories, the observed
phenomena correspond to "reaction to novelty" and "habituation” (adaptation) of

the receptor to the exogenous perturbance. An opposite jump, which begins at time
L3. first causes disappearance of output pulses followed by processing of the third
established level if the DH has the necessary time to process the perturbance. If
the latter changes faster than the DH can process it (DH is overloaded), the output
pulse sequence acquires the appearance inherent in frequency-pulse modulation.
Thus, the delta modulating model includes, in specific modes, a frequency modulat-
lng model; however, it explains more naturally the "reaction to novelty".and "habi-
tuation" modes. '

non OFFICIAL USE ONLY

The DH with the block diagram illustrated in Figure l simulates a receptor with
an "on" reaction, i.e., one that reacts to positive build-up of perturbance by
increasing the number of output pulses per unit time. A model of a receptor with
an "off" reaction is obtained if the comparator inputs are switched; then its
hysteretic characteristic changes to the opposite sign.

it is known [3, 4] that biological receptors can not only transform the type of
input information but also submit it to some degree of primary processing. The

delta modulating model of reception makes it possible to develop the most ele-

mentary computer and logic devices, as well as to identify multicomponent vector
images.

Figure 3 illustrates the block diagram of a device that identifies an N-component
vector image. It consists of N DM's which have weighted (by means of R1, ..., RN)
access to the general integrator.

The input signals go to N inputs of the DM, some of which are direct and the others
are inverted. Approximating voltage is formed on capacitance c under the influence
of N channels, and in the established mode its mean value UIn is proportionate to
superposition of components from each DM. The appropriate spatial location of
inputs in the test environment adjusts the device for the extremum Um, i.e.. makes
it possible to identify a specified image.

The technical execution of delta modulating models requires linkage to a specific
type of receptor. The structure and parameters of the local integrator are
then defined; selection is made of the width of the comparator hysteresis loop
and determination is made of the required lag of key commutation. A functional
receptor model can be constructed in.accordance with the above description on
a modern element basis in compact form, or else on a computer.

[Text] One of the typical distinctions of instinctive animal behavior in their
natural habitat is the rather frequent occurrence of conflict situations. We

refer to situations, in which there are simultaneous tendencies toward expressing
several incompatible forms of behavior. Numerous experimental studies pursued by
ethulugists have shown that animals have a number of specific mechanisms that

enable then to choose and express a given form of behavior when such situations
arise [i]. In spite of the many experimental studies, the principles of organiza—
tion of the mechanisms that implement behavior in-conflict situations are still
unclear. At the same time, it is of great practical importance to study instinctive
animal behavior in conflict situations. It would permit the development of a number
of new automatic [robot] systems expressing complex multigoal behavior in a

constantly changing environment, and would permit elaboration of basically new
methods of controlling animals.

He offer here a model aimed at the study of the dynamics of factors that motivate
different forms of instinctive behavior in conflict situations. Its axiomatics
are based on a number of properties of animal instincts, which were discovered and
studied by ethologists [2, 3]. The structural unit of the proposed model is the
behavior operator whose functions include achieving a specific result and checking
presence of conditions in the environment that are favorable for this. In turn,
the result of each behavioral operator of a higher level is achieved by reaching a
series of local results that are controlled [checked] by operators on lower levels.
Interaction between operators on adjacent hierarchic levels is achieved by means
of motivational priority (HP) transmitted from higher level operators to lower
level operators. There is integration in HP, which determines the choice of a
specific operator in a situation conflict, of both the necessity of expression

of a given operator and presence of favorable conditions for this in the environ-
ment.

At the top level of hierarchy thus organized there are operators that control
occurrence of animal needs (hunger, reproductive, defense behavior, etc.). At

60

FOI‘OIFKJA1.USE(HELY
the [our t hierarchic level are the operators that activate the appropriate motor

coordination effecting active interaction between the animal and environment during
instinctive behavior. In turn, each motor coordination is broken down into stereo-
type and orienting components. There are a number of ethological works validating

uurh a description of hierarchy of behavioral mechanisms of instinctive behavior
ll. 3.4]-

The term of distribution of HP going from an operator to lower level operators is

an important factor, which largely determines the typical features of animal behavior.
It should be stressed that the MP of this operator not only proceeds toward lover
level operators consistent with its goals but to conflicting operators, though to 8
lesser extent. This has been confirmed by an entire series of experimental etholo-
gicai studies [1, 2]. Evidently, this property of HP is related to the distinctions
of expression of systems controlling instinctive behavior based on neuronal
mechenisms.

In this version of the model, two main types of conflict are considered, which arise
between different forms ofinstinctive behavior. We refer, first, to conflict for
dominance over the effector system of the animal, which expresses the motor action
on the environment; second, for dominance over the perceptual system that effects
perception and analysis of signals from the environment. The first variant of
conflict occurs chiefly on the lowest hierarchic level of behavior. The second
Occurs on virtually all hierarchic levels and determines preadjuatment of the per-
ceptual system to perception of a particular class of signals. It should be stressed
that other variants of conflicts may arisein the course of instinctive behavior,

but we can disregard them in the first approximation.

Figure 1 illustrates the hierarchic structure of behavioral mechanisms. As we
see from the diagram, a set of triggering stimuli X“ goes to thenlth hierarchic
level. Let us designate as P“ the set of MP on the mth level. If P? is the MP
set or the ith operator on level m,

P'qu'x...xP.‘x...x Pa. tel...’

where [m - {izlsisim) is the set of operators on level m and an is the number of
operators on the mth level.

The MP distribution from each operator on level m goes to operators on the lover

(m - I) level. Thus, we obtain the display [reflection7]:
new:

where p? is the set of priorities going to operators of the On-l)th level from
operator i on level m.

Each level of this hierarchy has a multilayer structure that effects the next

displays. In the first layer there is analysis of adequacy of the triggering
situation in the environment with consideration of preadjustnent, and the cartesian

on level In is reflected on all operators on the lower-m - 1 level, in set Int-1

we single out a subset of adequate operators 1:,“ which is characterized by con-
siderably higher values of motivational priorities coming to its operators from the
ith operator on the mth level. ..It should be noted that for any two operators i and
J of level In, the set Iggy: - Ilh-xﬁgpx determines comon operators for then on
level m - l, which can e feet ambivaéent ehavior. 0n the other hand, the con-
flicting operators belong to set [,1]: m' tuning“.

The animal's effector system consists of a set of stereotypes R. and set of orienta-
lion channels Rk. Each configuration of motor action is given by the operator of
the lowest, first level by means of display ﬂéxP}, + p}, , where p}, - p11,, 51 x ... x

are incompatible, i.e., they cannot be expressed simultaneously. Let us designate

Then, from the definition of adequate behavioral action it directly ensues that

containing both 011 and DJ- elmnts. and consisting of compatible channels of orienta-
tion and stereotypes. As shown by the observations of ethologists, such movements

do indeed occur in certain conflict nodes, and they play a large part in reproductive
and territorial behavior of animals [1-3].

We used the hydraulic model of motivation proposed by K. Lorenz [2] to derive the
system of differential equations describing the dynamics of redistribution of HP

among behavior operators on different hierarchic levels. It was considered that

the intensity of MP going to each operator depends on evaluation of the degree of
adequacy of triggering conditions in the environment. In turn, the evaluation of
degree of adequacy is affected both by the state of the environment and preadjust-
ment of the perceptive system. Jnertia of change in MP of the jth operator on the

mth level was set by parameter J, which depends on the specific distinctions of
the form of behavior under study.

Thus. proceeding from the applicability of hydraulic analogy to processes of re-
distribution of motivation, we obtained the following system of equations:

where Ls determines the outlay of HP with the operator in a passive state and Ln

System (J) of differential equations enables us to investigate different modes of
conflict between two, as well as several forms of behavior. It was used to create

44
FOI‘OFFKJAL.USE(NVLY
a dynamic simulation model on a digital computer aimed at the study of conflict be-
tween two or three forms of behavior with a three-level hierarchy. The state of
the environment was described by a one-dimensional numerical parameter, and it
could be given as a function of time or by means of a chart whose peaks consisted
of different states of the environment, while the motor reactions of the animal
model served as the edges.

Figure 2 illustrates the block diagram of the simulation model of conflict in
instinctive behavior. Some of the behavioral operators are shown there in the
form of circles.

A study of the dynamic characteristics of conflict using this model made it possible
to develop a basically new method of objectivizing the structural units of instinctiv<
behavior [5] based on the fact that, according to the model, with successive change
in behavior operators there should be stepped change in magnitude of HP. Such
stepped change in HP was confirmed in experiments with caddis-fly larvae [6] using
the method of conflict interruption, which was also developed on the basis of this
model. At the present time, the proposed objectivization method and method of
conflict interruption are used in a number of studies dealing with animal instincts.

In addition, this model made it possible to predict the existence of the phenomenon
of stability of dominant behavior operators, as well as to investigate the effects
of various endogenous and exogenous factors on stability, study the causes of onset
of pathologically stable states and inadequate modes of behavior in conflict
situations.

Since the proposed model describes rather general features of instinctive behavior
in conflict situations, after appropriate modification it was found adequate for
investigation of dynamics of conflict in the system of physiological homeostasis.
A study of disturbances referable to processes of physiological homeostasis using
this model made it possible to propose new methods of nonspecific therapy and to
develop a number of basically new devices for treating the acupuncture points of
the human body. At the present time, the proposed methods and equipment are being
used with success in the Department of Clinical and Hospital Surgery at the
People's Friendship University imeni Lumumba, Second Central Design Office of HPS
[expansion unknown] and Central Children's Hospital in Rostov-na-Donu.

[Text] In 1936. the English zoologist, James Gray [1), expounded the hypothesis
that the critical Reynolds number oi an actively swimming dolphin must be higher
than in a dolphin swimming by hertis or a rigid model in the shape of a dolphin.
This could be caused by negative pressure gradient on the body of an actively
swinming dolphin. which Gray assumed existed on the basis of speculation and
rather naive considerations. Nevertheless, Gray's hypothesis is apparently true.
as indicated by the results of this study.

In the course of active swimming; the dolphin's body oscillates transversely. and
the amplitude of oscillations increases Iran the head to the tail. This is the so-
called locomotor wave that causes appearance of thrust. It can be demonstrated
that the locomotor wave also leads to formation of a negative pressure gradient
along the dolphin's body in the direction from head to tail, and its magnitude is
quite sufficient for raising appreciably Reynolde' critical number.

In the first approximation, it can be considered that the dolphin's body is
cylindrical, and the section of the body changes little over its length. In this
case. the distribution of pressure on the body surface is determined by the
well-known equation [2]:

in equation (1). the unknown is the velocity of transverse body move-ants. This
parameter can be found if the law of body deformation is known. The law of defor-
mation for the dolphin's body during active swimming has been proposed in the
following form [3]:

n‘m[K.--l+exp[a(:)7]]singly-._L_]; (3)

where n. is the amplitude of oscillations of the tail. Kr is the ratio of ampli-
tude of head oscillations to tail oscillations, u is circular frequency, t is
time, Cr is phasic velocity of loc0notor wave in the region of the head. 7 is the
coefficient of degree of build-up of amplitude of locomotor wave, b is the
parameter characterizing phasic velocity of the locomotor wave as a function of
coordinate in the system of coordinates related to the animal's body and a .

ln (2 - Kr). The position of the dolphin's body in this system of coordinates

is illustrated in Figure l.

correspond to model No 28. The dash line in Figure 2 shows overall pressure cal-

culated on the assumption that the additivity principle applies. He were impressed

by the monotonously dropping function of overall pressure. which is indicative of

presence of negative pressure gradient over the entire dolphin body, from head to

tail, and the negative pressure gradient is considerably higher in the region of

the head and stalk of the tail than in the middle part of the body.

illustrates the distribution of form parameter of the profile of velocities in
the boundary layer on the dolphin body. The nature of distribution of the form
parameter enables us to derive the following conclusions:
1) in the dolphin there must be a 3-4-fold increase in Reynolds'
- critical number estimated for body length;
2) turbulization of the boundary layer must start in the central part
of the dolphin body, where the form parameter has lowest values.

The presence of a negative pressure gradient on the body of an actively swimming

dolphin, as well as its effect on the fine structure of the turbulized boundary
layer, have already received experinental confirmation [9, 10].

Use of Units for Dynamic Analysis of Random Processes in Biomedical Studies
[Article by M. A. Rozenblat and A. A. Romashchev]

[Text] Oneof theimportant directions of development of modern medical instrument
building is related to elaboration of methods for analysis, diagnostics and prog-
nostics based on consideration of the human body as a dynamic system, the patterns
of function of which have stochastic coaponenta, in addition to deterministic ones.
The required instruments must determine immediately [dynamica11y, directly] on a
real time scale the main parameters of both components of the biomedical process
or phenomenon under study. The results of analysis must be submitted to the ob-
scher (medical personnel) in a form that is convenient for immediate use without
any further processing. The instruments must not require special technical know-
ledge on the part of medical personnel, they must be convenient to service,
impervious to noise and effect analysis of the phenomenon under study for a rather
short period of time. which is necessary for effective use thereof in the case of
screening and checking the condition of a large number of patients.

The electrocardiographic signal (BCS), electroencephalographic signal (BBS), electric
hloputentials of individual points or parts of the body, etc., are typical parameters
01 the body that have determined and stochastic components. The same signal com-
ponents appear when using various active methods of biomedical studies. involving

the use of exogenous factors on some organ or other, for example, sound, source of
radiation. photic pulses, etc., and determination of its reaction.

Hetermination of the informative tags of a biomedical phenomenon or process contain-
ing stochastic components requires many measurements and labor-consuming calculations,
and for this reason automatic methods of analysis based on the use of general purpose
or specialized computers are used predominantly. Although microcomputers or standard
microprocessor units can often be used, if their memory is large enough, the diffi-
culty of technical execution of the analytic system usually limits the area of their
application in dynamic, stochastic methods of analysis of biomedical processes,

and makes it impossible or impractical to use monitoring and measuring equipment

as sbedside monitor. Expanded use of these methods in both scientific research and
medical practice could lead to development of inexpensive specialized instruments
that take into consideration the specifics of the analysis in question.

The processes that occur in a living organism may be either continuous (for example,
blood pressure) or discrete (for example, duration Ti of cardiac cycles). It is a
known fact that any continuous process can be analyzed, with virtually no loss of
accuracy, by the method of discrete samples and, consequently, the equipment that
operates on this principle acquires a universal character. For this reason, we
shall discuss only the discrete presentation {mi} of a random process 2(t) at

time ti.

For dynamic analysis of the parameters of process {3;}, it is the most expedient to
use recurrent algorithms. In this case, evaluation of parameters can be obtained
at the same pace as input of the next value of 3i and, consequently, one can reduce
data processing time to the maximum extent.

The main characteristics of random processes include mathematical expectation Hlx]
and dispersion D[x}. The recurrent algorithm for calculation thereof has the
following appearance [1, 2]:

Aids] = A“ 4' Ya (In: — Md; Din =' Di_+ VI “3101" ”0‘" Dllo (1)

where “i and Di are evaluations of mathematical expectation and dispersion of
process {xi}, respectively, and Yi is a certain sequence of numbers. One can use,
for example:

i = l/(i + 1), i - 0. l. 2.... (2)
Evaluation of standard deviation is 01; - m
As can be seen in (l), calculation of Hi and D5 is made using a similar algorithm:
0m = Q. + n (z... — 0.). ‘ (3)

With zi - z£,mye obtain the estimate of “ﬁr and with 3i - (xi - H£-|)2, the estimate
of Di. It is easy to obtain a function of the (3) type using integral semiconductor
operational amplifiers and digital elements according to the scheme given in [2].
Let us call the corresponding device the averaging unit (AU). The intrinsic
distinctions of the AU of this type are discussed in [2, 3]. It is convenient to
render the computer of static characteristics of random processes on the basis of
such AU's, which makes it possible to obtain estimates on a real time scale of
mathematical expectation, dispersion standard deviation and coefficient of variation
of both continuous and discrete random processes.

Filtration of ejects (interference) in the run under study, which could distort
substantially the obtained data, is an important task that arises in developing
instruments for analysis of random biomedical processes. These ejects may be
caused by superposition of other random processes on the one under study, technical
noise, etc. For example, when analyzing the heart rhythm according to electro-
cardiographic signal, ejects may be caused by temporary rhythm disturbances (electro-
systole. etc.) or technical noise (artefacts) caused by impaired electrode contacts,
movement of the patient, etc. One can eliminate the influence of such ejects on
the results of determination of mathematical expectation and dispersion of the
studied (uncontaminated) process if the permissible values of process {3%} are

only those that satisfy the following condition:

" tau—Ma <ha.. ‘ m

where k is a constant that is determined mainly by probability a of appearance of
major noise (ejects). We can demonstrate that for typical values of u - 0.01-0.1,
k '3.

Formula (4) is the solving rule for determination and rejection of "suspicious"
values of the process or ejects. To make practical use of rule (4) for analysis

of process {xi} on a real time scale, we must have either at least approximate a
priori estimates of H*hr] and 0*Lr], or else they must be found in the course of
analysis. In the latter case, part T1 of total analysis time TA is used for the
initial rough estimate of parameters M*[z] and 0*Lr]. For this purpose, during

time Tx<TA, we can select 0* - Omaxo where “max is the maximum possible value

of 0*, and one can use the current mean of processici}as H*. In view of the fact
that the probability of ejects is usually low, the initial estimates of H* and 0*
obtained in time T1 in (4) will correspond to the sought estimates with a probability
of close to one. During the main period of analysis T1<t<TA, the values of H* and 0*
in (a) are determined by the current estimates of these parameters, i.e., there is
continuous adaptation of the unit that selects values of {xi} which satisfy condition
(4) in a specific run of process {2;}.

Several instruments were developed on the basis of algorithm (1) and solving rule
(a), for determination of the parameters of various biomedical processes. We
shall dwell in greater detail on one of these instruments, the "Cardiorhythm,"
which is intended for dynamic measurement of tne main statistical characteristics
of cardiac rhythm [6].

Analysis of cardiac rhythm from the standpoint of random processes and theory of
transient processes enables us to obtain the data that are required for fuller
understanding of the mechanisms of regulation of a number of body functions, evalu-
ation of the condition of the heart and organism in certain clinical situations and
for diagnostics of diseases.

A study of the parameters characterizing heart rhythm revealed that the most in-
formative ones include the mean value and standard deviation of duration of cardiac
cycles. These parameters are of great interest for the following reasons. 0n the
one hand, they characterize the correlation between central and autonomic nervous
roguluLion in forming the heart rhythm, being also the main parameters of density
of distribution of cardiac cycles, and, on the other hand, they are not too compli-
cated for determination by instruments.

53

FOR‘OFHKJAI.1KHB(M§LY
It is conVenient to determine the duration of cardiac cycles according to RR inter-
vuls of the acs. Let us designate the duration of the ith cardiac cycle as _RR¢ and
mean value and standard deviation as RR and oRR, respectively. Parameter RR
determines the mean pulse rate and ORR the mean arrhythmia. Calculation of ORR
involves operations of raising to the second power and extraction of the square
root. This complicates the equipment.

To make things simpler. parameter AR—Rwhich can be easily calculated, is used in
the Cardiorhythm instrument, and it is found with the following equation:

N
._ 1 ‘ —
= RR — RI! .
ﬁrRﬁl l I

whereRR '7'V‘2‘ Rm. and N is the number of cardiac cycles, 1. e.. AER is the mean
modulus of deviation of RR; intervals from RR. The number N of cardiac cycles is
selected in accordance with the required size of the sample (duration of measure-
ment). With a given law of distribution, ORR and ARR are related by a linear
function, ARR - 8083. Hith the Gaussian law of distribution of RR¢ intervals, which
usually governs normal (sinus) cardiac rhythm, 8 - 0.8.

Abnormal RRi intervals, related to either extrasystoles or artefacts, are eliminated
in the instrument by means of a filter that realizes the above-mentioned solving
rule (6). Each appearance of an abnormal RR; interval causes a pulsed flashing

of a light. In some special cases, for example, auricular fibrillation, one can
disconnect signal filtration.

The Cardiorhythm instrument canoperate in the mode of single calculations with
automatic stops after the 66th, 128th or 256th cardiac cycle and storage of the
results. When used in a monitoring system, there is automatic repetition of cal-
culations. There are provisions in the instrument for setting threshold values RR}
and ERRc. If even one of parameters RR and ARR exceed the range set for a given
patient, there are audio and light signals that appear.

The preamplified tcs or pulsed signal from a digital sensor can serve as input
signal. The results of calculating RR and ARR are shown on dials with needles,

and they can be put out in analogue form from the external terminals of the instru-
ment for graphic recording or input in a computer.

The Cardiorhythm is a specialized instrument based on integrated microcircuita.

Instruments of the Cardiorhythm type have been used to analyze cardiac rhythm in
diverse biomedical examinations, such as complex evaluation of a patient's condi-
tion in the course of preoperative preparation, during surgery and in the post-
operative period; complex evaluation of the condition of patients with ischemic
heart disease; evaluation of drug therapy and preparation of a patient for defibril-
lation in the presence of auricular fibrillation; evaluation of the state of
patients' cardiovascular period at the acute stage of myocardial infarction and at
the stage of physical rehabilitation to predict endurance of physical loads; com-

plex evaluation of the state of an operator in the presence of psychoenotional
loads, etc.

[Text] After the appearance of influenza A virus [Hongkong/1/68 (B3N2)] altered
variants thereof began to be detected more and more often. This circumstance
caused almost annual epidemics of influenza varying in intensity (I. V. Antonova).
The influenza epidemic in Moscow, which occurred in December 1979 - January 1980,
was caused by A virus [Texas/1/77-(B3N2)] and antigen-related A strains (EJNZ-
Bangkok).

More than 800 patients with influenza were hospitalized in therapeutic departments
of Municipal Clinical Hospital No 52, which were respecialized for the duration of
the epidemic.

in this report, we submit clinica1,1aborstory and functional data on 25 patients
who were admitted to the intensive care unit because of the severity of their
condition. The diagnosis of influenza had been confirmed in all 25 cases by
laboratory tests-—demonstration of influenza antigen in the respiratory tract by
the immunofluorescence method (in 11 out of 16 cases, including 4 post mortem)
and diagnostic increment of antibody titer in serological tests (hemagglutination
inhibition and complement fixation tests).

This group of patients ranged in age from 15 to 81 years, but there was prevalence
of young people. Thus, there were 9 patients 15-30 years of age, 6 who were 31-

50 years old, 5 51-55 years old and 5 over 70 years of age. They were hospitalized
at different stages of illness: 10 within the first 3 days, 13 on the 4th-7th days
and 2 on the 9th day.

The condition of 17 out of the 25 patients was judged extremely serious and, in
the other 8. serious.

FOI<OFFKJAI.USE(NVLY

Seriousness of condition upon admission was largely due to both severe toxicosis and
complications referable to respiratory organs (23 out of 25 cases), primarily pneu-
monia (19 cases) or diffuse bronchitis (4). Two patients (15 and 21 years old) had
no pulmonary complications. In addition, concomitant diseases, exacerbated under
the influence of influenza infection, affected the severity of condition, particu-
larly among the elderly (11 cases): chronic ischemic heart disease (7), chronic
nonspecific lung disease (2), blood disease (1) and severe diabetes associated

with diabetic coma (l). -

All clinical signs of influenza infection were present. It was characterized by
acute onset, rapid elevation of temperature and concurrent intensive buildup of
toxicosis (see Table). All patients presented headache, exhaustion, aches and

pains (22 cases), not infrequently severe adynamia, inhibition (19), chills (l8),
vertigo (18), as well as changes in the vascular and central nervous system-uncon-
sciousness and meningeal symptoms (12), syncope (3) and others. In most cases, maxi-
mum temperature was 40°c or higher (14 cases), and it constituted 38.6°C in only

2 patients (presenting signs of pneumonia, who subsequently expired).

All of the patients presented cyanosis of mucous membranes and skin, which was

sometimes extremely marked, to the extent of severe cyanosis. Many had hemor-

rhagic symptoms in the form of petechial hemorrhages of the mucous membrane (16
cases), nosebleed (4) and admixture of blood in sputum (9).

The respiratory tract was involved in all patients, as manifested by cough (24
cases), marked tracheitis or laryngotracheitis (18) and moderate rhinitis (13).

The severity of the patients' condition, partiCularly in cases complicated by
pneumonia or bronchitis, was due primarily to respiratory insufficiency (21 cases)
and in most cases developed or incipient pulmonary edema (13), cerebral edema
(12), acute cardiovascular insufficiency (6) with marked toxicosis. Tbxicosis was
observed both in elderly patients with massive pneumonia and.young people who
presented no complications.

it is known that bacteria play a rather important role (P. G. Epshteyn; Ye. s.
Ketiladze et al.) in the pathogenesis of complicated forms of influenza, along
with influenza virus. but in essence there is development of both viral and bac-
terial infection, manifested by specific clinical symptoms, in the severe and
complicated cases of influenza.

Superposituntofbacterial infection caused deeper involvement of bronchi in the
process, with very distinct signs of acute or exacerbated chronic bronchitis (8
cases). A dry cough (2d) was observed only at the early stages of illness. 0n
subsequent days, the sputum became mucoid or mucopurulent (l9). Sine patients
had an admixture of blood in sputum, some developed massive hemoptysis, which
lasted for a long time in some cases (up to l3th-15th day of illness).

There were clinical and roentgenological signs of pneumonia in 19 out of the 25
patients upon admission, starting on the lat-2d day of illness. The signs of
toxicosis, hyperthermia and involvement of the nervous system were more marked in
expressly this group of patients. '

in most cases, pneumonia was massive-~conf1uent and focal (17 cases), bilateral
(9). Intensive pleural pain (6), as well as development of pulmonary edema (13)
were not uncommon in cases of development of pneumonia. In four cases the pneu-
monia was destructive~abscessing.

hemolytic staphylococcus (8 cases), streptococcus (4), pneumococcus (2), Fried-
lander‘s bacillus (1), E. coli (3), as well as fungi and yeast cells (4). All of
the patients from whose sputum yeast cells and Candida fungi were isolated
received antibiotics with a broad spectrum of action for a long time. With
administration of antibacterials, there was sometimes a change of pathogen. How~
ever, it is known that investigation of the etiology of pneumonia by such conven-
tional methods is not very informative (V. P. Sil'vestrov). For this reason. the
results of serological tests on pairs of blood serum samples with the use of
staphylococcal u-toxin were more conclusive. One-third of the patients presented
a diagnostic increment of titer of antigen to staphylococcus (including 6 out of
6 cases with staphylococcus in sputum). This confirms once more the significant
etiological role of staphylococcus in development of pneumonia with influenza,
and this must be taken into consideration in deciding on the tactics of antibiotic
therapy.

Repeated dynamic studies of acid-base parameters (AB) by the Astrup method in
cases of influenza complicated by pneumonia revealed. in most cases, compensated
metabolic acidosis and, in the more serious cases, decompensated metabolic

acidosis. Acidosis persisted for a long time in patients with massive pneumonia.
in spite of corrective therapy, normalization of AB parameters lagged 1-3 days
behind appearance of clinical signs of resolution of pneumonia. Metabolic decom-
pensated and respiratory acidosis was noted in the group of patients with serious
concomitant pathology and cases of lethal outcome.

According to the results of EKG tests in the course of illness, during the period
of marked toxicosis in cases of massive polysegmented pneumonia (17 patients).
there was sinus tachycardia of up to 110-130/min and isolated atrial extrasystoles.
At the height of toxicosia, elderly patients presented isolated and group ventricu-
lar extrasystoles. It should be noted that among elderly patients, in the group
that expired, influenza was associated with chronic ischemic heart disease (6 cases),
to which we can relate the frequency of complications in the form of ventricular
extrasystole. Deviation of the electric axis of the heart to the right, appearance
of either an increase in amplitude of Raszv shift of transient zone of chest
leads, decrease in amplitude of 5V1Vz wave and transient block of the right

branch of the bundle of His (2 cases) should be interpreted as signs of overload

on the right ventricle, which were observed in cases of the most massive pneumonia.
As toxicosis diminished and pneumonia regressed, these EKG changes disappeared
entirely.

In three young patients (15, 17 and 28 years old), the clinical manifestations

and EKG changes-msrked sinus tachycardia, dynamics of T waves-were evaluated as
infectious-allergic myocarditis, which complicated the course of influenza and
pneumonia. In two of these cases, clinical and EKG signs disappeared within 17-26
days, and in one (28 years old) the myocarditis became protracted.

Blood tests on complicated cases (3d-5th day of illness) revealed leukocytosis (up
to 20,000-25,000) with marked left shift of the formula and elevated erythrocyte
sedimentation rate. There was also a marked left shift of the formula in un-
complicated cases of influenza, at the early stage of illness.

One of the distinctions of this epidemic was that the toxicosis, with high fever
and circulatory disturbances inherent in influenza (Ye. S. Ketiladze), elicited in
many cases signs of cerebral edema (12 people) and pulmonary edema (13), which
were observed not only in the complicated cases, but in patients without complica-
tions referable to respiratory organs. It is known that new strains of influenza
virus have very marked toxigenic properties, to which are related the severe

signs of systemic toxicosis with circulatory disturbances, cerebral edema and
extensive lesion to the epithelium of the respiratory tract (Ye. S. Ketiladze).

Analysis of the clinical symptoms of the patients under our observation revealed
thut the severity of influenza during this epidemic should be linked primarily
with the influenza virus proper, rather than only the presence of complications.
prrossly this can explain the development of such serious forms of influenza in
young people, who presented no concomitant disease whatsoever.

The complicated cases of influenza received complex therapy aimed at different
elements of the pathological process (V. F. Krylov; V. I. Pokrovskiy; Ye. S.
Kctiladze et al., and others). Intravenous infusion of polyglucin, rheopolyglucin,
hemodes, glucose solutions and dry plasma was used to control toxicosis. The
tactics of treatment of toxicosia had the goal of infusing sufficient doses of
fluids with strict monitoring of hourly positive diuresis. Special attention was

59

FOR 0F11CLRL USEIJNLY
DUI UI'MLIAL UM ONLY

given to dehydration therapy in cases of appearance of the edema syndrome-
cerebral edema, pulmonary edema. In such cases, therapy included intravenous in-
jeciion of diuretics (lasix, furosemide, hyperosmotic mannitol solutions), as well
as corticosteroids (prednisolone, hydrocortisone). In addition, when indicated

in cases of development of pulmonary edema, fluid was aspirated from the respiratory
tract and there were numerous sessions of breathing with a constantly elevated
pressure of the air-oxygen mixture.

In cases of acute cardiovascular insufficiency, glycosides, mezaton, norepineph-
rine. large doses of prednisolone and hydrocortisone were used. When there was
diminished contractile function of the myocardium, particularly among elderly
patients with concomitant chronic disease, cardiac glycosides were prescribed.
Complex therapy included expectorants and multiple vitamins; the patients also
received antihistamines and desensitizing agents at the same time.

Treatment of inflammatory processes in the lungs occupied a special place. From
the very first hours of hospitalization, at least two different antibiotics were
ordered, with mandatory administration of one of them intravenously. Most often,
intravenous injections of sodium penicillin (6-8 million units/day) with con-
current intramuscular injection of penicillin (6-6 active units) were given,
which were combined with gentamycin, semisynthetic penicillin, tetraolean [sigma-
mycin] and others. Because of the massive nature of pneumonia in most cases,

at least 3-4 course of therapy were administered to achieve a therapeutic response,
with successive alternation of antibiotics, using erythromycin (for intravenous
injection), ceporin,[cephaloridinel, lincomycin, tetraolean, metacycline, vibro-
mycin, fusidin and others. Inhalation therapy occupied a large place in further
treatment of pneumonia: DNAase, lysozyme, chymotrypsin. Inhalation therapy was
instituted at the early stage of illness, after the patients were brought out of
their extremely serious condition.

Considering the experience of the thoracic department at the Institute of Surgery
imeni A. V. Vishnevskiy, USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, at the recommendation
of A. H. Harshak, we used trichopol [flagyl] in average doses of 0.25, 3-4 times
a day for 16-21 days, to suppress nongas-forming anerobic microorganisms in the
focus of inflammation.

In most cases, there was slow regression of the inflammatory process in the lungs.
Fever persisted for 3 to 20 days (average of 10.9 days). However, even with nor-
malization of_temperature, a cough persisted for a long time (12-28 days, average
21.8 days), with gradual change from suppurative to mucous sputum, after which

it disappeared. The physical changes in the lungs persisted for 10 to 30 days
(average 17.6 days). According to roentgenological examination, the inflammatory
changes in lung tissue persisted for 3-5 weeks. In cases of abscessing and con-
comitant pleurisy (see Table), fever, pleural pain, physical and roentgenological
changesin the lungs lasted 6-8 weeks.

In most cases, the outcome of illness was good. Seven patients expired, mainly
among elderly individuals, including 4 who were 80-81 years old. There were
serious concomitant diseases in 6 out of these 7 cases: chronic cardiac ischemia
with cardiac decompensation (2 cases), chronic nonspecific lung disease (2),
blood disease (1), severe diabetes with diabetic coma (in patients 65 years of
age), with massive (destructive in 2 cases) pneumonia. As a rule, death was

60

FOR‘OFFKJAI.USEGMNLY
due to respiratory and cardiovascular insufficiency, pulmonary and cerebral edema.
In four cases of late hospitalization, death occurred within the first 24 h.

Long-term followbup was pursued for 3-5 months after discharge on 10 out of 18
convalescents. By this time, virtually all of them were fit for work. However,
some of them periodically suffered from dull, pulling aches in the chest when
breathing deeply. Physically, there was vesicular respiration (attenuated
breathingiJla 15-year—old female patient after abscesaing pneumonia), without

raies or pleural friction. Recheck x-rays revealed deformation of lung pattern and
pleural superpositions only in cases of abscessing and pleurisy. AB test showed

no deviation from normal. Signs of infectious-allergic myocarditis persisted
clinically and according to EKG findings in one case (28 years old).

Thus. treatment of patients with severe, complicated form of influenza is a com-
plicated and difficult task. There is worsening of the prognosis among elderly
patients, particularly in the presence of concomitant chronic disease.
Influenza is often complicated by toxicosis, with development of pulmonary and
cerebral edema, which determines the tactics of intensive therapy of this group
of patients.

[Article by L. I. Borodkin from book "Modeling and Optimization of Complex Control
Systems", editor in chief Ya. z. Tsypkin, corresponding member of the USSR
Academy of Sciences, lzdatei'stvo "Nauka", 2350 copies, 271 pages]

[Text] Availability of information about structure, intensity and direction of
cosmunications between elements plays a substantial part in controlling any complex
system. when considering oncology as a complex dynamic system, one usually singles
out the information relations between scientific directions of this major scientific
discipline as a decisive factor [1, 2].

Analysis of the structure of information relations in oncology and their quantitative
characteristics becomes particularly important in solving a number of practical
problems of optimum organization and control of research in this important branch

of medicine. One of the most pressing problems of this type is to refine the
planning of scientific research, particularly complex research; in this regard,

it becomes necessary to also solve more special problems, for example, that of
improving the supply of information to oncologists concerning the latest results
obtained in allied areas of research. .

A new approach was described [2, 3] to analysis of the structure of communication
networks in oncology; which is based on the approximation method of aggregating
empirical charts with many peaks [6), which permits presentation of the structure
of relations between elements of a complex system in a compressed or enlarged form.

He propose here further development of this approach, which consists of using a
probabilistic analogue of the approximation method of aggregating empirical charts
[5] leading to broader opportunity of interpreting aggregation results. An algo-
rithm is offered that executes the stochastic method of analyzing the structure

of information relations in oncology, which is based on the use of this method.

1. Approximation method of aggregation of empirical charts (stochastic
approach). Let G(x, A) be a weighted "orgraph" [organisation chart?], where x

is the set of peaks specified by numbers 1. 2, ..., n; A - Haijﬂ? is the matrix

of arc weights. Let us specify that Y - {Y1, .... in} is s set of "diffuse" units
["blocks"] Oncn). For each £GK let us also take into consideration a set of

numbers {¢' , q - I. m} characterizing the we ht of reference of the ith peak

of chart culo each of them units {Yq, q - 1, m :

£9.51. 9.,>0 (q=1._nl);wherel<l<n. u)

 

Expressions (1) specify matrix 0- ||¢ II man in size, the 13th line of which can
be interpreted as distribution of proﬁbilities that element 126x belongs to each
of units {Yq, q - l, m}. According to [6]. we shall describe the strength of
relation of each pair of unite (1p, Yq) by a certain number Cqui‘

 

c" = O. ’2” “‘17 0710/ “’2“ 909;. (P. 4= 17"»). (2)

Let us approximate the initial chart c(x, A) by means of chart 6(x, 2), where
X - 0001' (3)

Then the stochastic approach to aggregation of weighted charts is formalized as
the following extremal problem:

minim—0091’]. I ' 5 ' (’0)
0e! .

where 27 is the set of matrices 0 mm in size. determined in accordance with (1).
With consideration of formulas (2) and (3), problem (4) is reduced to minimization
in set F of the functional: ' '

 

a. I m a I I '
_ 5
l _k.;a| [at] — I'VE-I ?tp,]g (“z-I a""""/r,z-| ,rp,h)] ' ' ( )

Thus, problem (6) is a. problem of nonlinear programing with restrictions (1);
functional J (0) in general is not convex. The algorithm of minimization of func-
tional (5) on set (1) is described below.

2. Algorithm of stochastic aggregation of empirical charts. The sub-
stantial distinction of emtremal problem (4) is that the restrictions (1) are
"separable": the permissible ran e of 9" specified in the (man-dimensional space
of variables {01; , i - l, n; p - l, m is the direct product of '5'- s’xs’x, ..., XS"
nil-dimensional s plexes:

This structural feature of problem (lo) enables us to turn to the general scheme of
the iterative algorithm of local minimization of functional (5), 2;. each iteration
of which there is minimization of functional (5) on a set of elements of only one

line of matrix 0 with fixed values of elements of the other n - 1 lines. Thus, in
solving each such special problem, variations of functional J depend only on varia-
tions of elements {pt-p, p - l. m} in the ith line being modified (and the permissible
range is simplex 5").

Proceeding from this. let us write out formula (5) isolating in overt form functional
J as a function of elements Nip: p - l, m}:

we shall submit functional (6) to minimization in set S": by means of an iterative
nonprojection algoritln based on the simple procedure of going on to the next itera-
tion, which assures movement in the permissible range (simplex 81').

This procedure of modifying a point on the simplex (analogous to the one proposed

where 16rd", u is a parameter of procedure (0%). and the smaller the value of a.
the closer point 3" is to point 0" (with a -> 0 ¢‘ + o‘).

Thus procedure (7) modifies point off-257; by increasing the value of the rth component
of ¢ir by means of redu ing the values of the other m - 1 components of pip(p ’1 1').

Let us designate point ‘3 which was obtained .in accordance with procedure (7) with

a certain fixed r, in the following manner: ‘1' - Dr¢1'.

Thus, let there be a given initial matrix «any:

The properties of.convergence of this algorithm are established with the follow-
ing theorem.

Theorem: If {¢i(t)} is a sequence constructed by algorithm 1, each of its limit
points belongs to the set T1681 of points, for which the necessary conditions of
minimum functional J(¢) on simplex 5" have been satisfied.

To run algorithm 1, it is necessary to set the condition for stopping it. Let us
stop operation of the algorithm if, when plotting the next point ¢’(t) the specified
precision of 6 has been achieved, i.e.,

It _ l _
I90) 9(1 1)I<3- (a)

Let us note that the scheme of constructing the above-described algorithm one
enables us to classify it with algorithms of the method of possible directions [7];
unlike known algorithms of this method, ours does not require solution at each
step of the extremal problems to determine the direction and magnitude of the

next step, which renders it quite simple to run.

0n the basis of algorithm 1, which is used for minimization of functional J on a
set of elements of one line of matrix 0, we can construct the general algorithm

to search for the approximate solution of the problem of aggregation of charts with
diffuse units (a), the permissible range of which is the set of all elements of
matrix 0 with limitations (1).

The algorithm is an iterative procedure with cyclic repetition of the sequence of
lines in matrix 0.

we start the search by specifying an arbitrary matrix 0(0Xi9— and a certain
number ¢>O. ‘

We use algorithm 1 in the kth iteration for minimization of functional J on the
set of elements of the next line of matrix 0(k - l) (algorithm 1 is stopped by
satisfying condition (8)).

3. Analysis of -he structure of information relations in oncology.
In this section we describe the results of using the above stochastic method of
aggregation of empirical charts to solve the problem of singling out the major
directions oi research in oncology and determining the structure of information
relations between them. And, as in [3], the chart of citations, the peaks of
which consisted of over 1600 publications dealing with oncology, which were
selected by experts from the Oncological Research Center of the

65

FOR‘0FFK]AL.USE(NVLY
I'UK UI'I‘ILIAI. U33. UNLI

USSR Academy of Medical Sciences,* was used as primary information. Subsequent

work was done on the basis of the classifier of the lost important topics of
uncological research, which was compiled by the Scientific Council for the Problem
oi "Malignant Neoplasms" under the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Medical
Sciences. This classifier has two levels, the first of which consists of 13 medical
directions (problems):

1. Biology and biochemistry of the neoplastic cell
2. Viral carcinogenesis

3. Chemical carcinogenesis

4. Radiation carcinogenesis

S. Immunology of tuners

6. Relationship between tumor and organism

7. Tumor morphology

8. Diagnosis of malignant tumors

9. Experimental and clinical chemotherapy

10. Surgical management

11. Radiobiology and radiotherapy
12. Epidemiology of malignant tumors
13. Scientific bases for organizing cancer control

Each of these problems consists of severa1 topics (total of 121), which form the
second level of the classifier.

Using this classifier and the initial citation chart we plotted chart 6', which
characterizes the intensity of citation (number of peaks on chart 6' is 13). The
weight of each are (i, j) of this chart equals the number of references in works
dealing with the ith problem to works dealing with the jth problem.

As in [3], we aggregated chart 6' to the level of four units.** In this case, the
units are "diffuse" and stochastic [probabilistic], so that it is possible, on the
one hand, to demonstrate the "nucleus" of directions determining the content of each
unit and, on the other hand, to define the role of each direction in each of the
units. This approach is expedient because of the complex, interdisciplinary nature
of scientific directions that make up the content of a dynamic field such as
oncology.

Table 1 illustrates matrix 0* of weights of reference of the indicated scientific
oncological directions to the four units that were singled out (the matrix is
constructed by means of the described algorithm; 6 - 0.01), and Table 2 shows
matrix C of interunit relations. As canbe seen in Table 1, only 5 of the 13 direc-
tions are contained in only one of the units, whereas the other 8 are "diffused"

in 2-3 units (this applies particularly to the "chemical carcinogenesis" and "chemo-
therapy of tumors" directions).

*Let us note that analysis of citation nets is, along with expert evaluation
methods, the main method of demonstrating the structure of relations in modern
science [1, 8].

The method of forming citation charts in oncology is described in [3].
**The structure of relations between units was so given as to have one of the units
(the fourth) isolated, i.e., the weight of reference of each peak of chart 6'
LO this unit should characterize the degree of information-related isolation
of the corresponding scientific direction.

To interpret the results contained in Table 1, let us set number p as the "threshold

of significance" of weights {¢c I. Let, for example, 0 - 0.5. Then directions 4

to data in Tables 1 and 2, contains 3 units. "Viral carcinogenesis, "chemical
carcinogenesis," "relations between tumor and organism" and "morphology of tumors"
directions are referable to unit A. The directions of "diagnosis of malignant
tumors," ”experimental and clinical chemotherapy," radiotiology and radiation
therapy," "epidemiology of malignant tumors" and "scientific bases for organizing
cancer control" belong to unit 3. The directions in unit c-"biology and bio-
chemistry of the cell" and "immunology of tumors”-play a central role in the .
structure of information; these directions, between which there is active exchange
of information, are also the "suppliers” of information for the directions in unit 3
(which could be arbitrary called clinical practice and experimentation) and
unit A (theoretical research). These two directions of unit C are consumers
of information supplied by the directions of unit A.

The nucleus [core] of unit A (Table 1) consists of directions 2 (viral carcino-

applied research; the weight of reference of chemotherapy of tumors (9) to unit
3 is 4 times greater than the weight of reference of this direction to unit C, etc.

in addition to directions 4 and 10, directions 8 (diagnosis of malignant tumors),
ll (radiobiology and radiotheraPY) and 13 (scientific bases for organizing cancer
control) are also characterized by some degree of information-related isolation.

In conclusion of this analysis, let us note that the results of stochastic aggre-
gation of the information structure of oncology, which generally conforms with
previous conclusions as to the nature of this structure [2, 3], not only defines
and enlarges upon them, but leads to a number of new conclusions.

[Text] This book deals with current problems of genetics of behavior and physio—
logical characters. It reports the results of studies conducted on various
objects, ranging from protozoans to man. Considerable attention is devoted to
research methods on the molecular, cellular, organismic and population levels.

A special place is reserved for the principles of genetic analysis of behavior.
There is rather full coverage of questions of genetic determination of behavior,
genetic control of neurohormonal distinctions and the learning process. The role
of behavior is disclosed in the process of evolution. The applied value of
genetic approaches is demonstrated with respect to monitoring the behavior of
farm animals. There is discussion of inheritance of pathological psychological
and behavioral changes in man. Unsolved problems of neurogenetics are'mentioned

and means of working on them are indicated. References 1023, figures kl, tables 30.
Introduction

significant progress in various branches of physiology, ethology, genetics, bio-
chemistry and psychiatry is to be credited for the conception and intensive
development at the present time of behavioral genetics as a science. This discipline
has achieved major success and was transformed into a broad interdisciplinary

branch of knowledge in the 2 decades that have elapsed since the first monograph

by J. Fuller and W. Thompson. "Behavior Genetics" (1960), was published. The
approaches and methods used to study the role of hereditary factors in formation

of animal behavior are being used more and more often each year in agricultural

and medical practice, in physiology and psychiatry. ~

The decree adopted by the CC CPSU and USSR Council of Ministers, "0n Measures

to Expedite Development of Holecular Biology and Molecular Genetics, and Use

the Achievements Thereof in the National Economy," opened up broad opportunities
for development of research in genetics of behavior and physiological processes.
However, the lack of a manual on methodology and problems of behavioral genetics,
in the Soviet educational literature, that would be available to all, is making
it difficult for this discipline to grow in our country. The book offered to the

69

ron 0mm use on“
reader, which was written by a team of prominent Soviet specialists in the field
of behavior genetics is an attempt to fill this gap.

It is not by chance that ”Physiological and Behavioral Genetics" was included in
the multivolume “Manual of Physiology" series, and its publication is timely. For
genetics is not only a science that deals with heredity; an equally important task
is to study the mechanisms and patterns of occurrence of intraspecific variability.
the existence of which causes considerable difficulties in analyzing and inter-

preting results of physiological experiments. Genetics can and must resolve and
explain the causes of this variability.

This textbook is constructed in-two sections. The first deals with general ques-
tions of behavioral genetics, principles of genetic analysis of behavior and
offers an idea about the special mathematical methods of processing research re-
sults. In this same part is described the current status of a number of pressing
problems of biochemical phenogenetics and neuroendocrine mechanisms of regulation
of genetic and cytogenetic processes. The second section deals with more special
problems of behavior genetics: problems of learning and inheritance of pathological
forms of behavior and, in particular, epilepsy and schizophrenia. A special dis-

tinction is made of problems of farm animal behavioral genetics and the problem
of microevolutionary role of behavior.

This manual begins with a chapter on the current status of genetics of behavior
and physiological processes. Its author, L. V. Krushinskiy, is a well-known
Soviet physiologist and geneticist; on the example of studies conducted with
different objects, he demonstrates the role of genotype and environment in forma-
tion of a number of physiological and behavioral characters. The second chapter
(written by L. 2. Kaydsnov and Ye. H. Luchnikova) deals with the principles of
genetic analysis of behavior, mainly in the Drosophila. The area of application,
advantages and disadvantages of the main methods of genetic analysis-mutation,
comparative genetic and breeding-~are submitted to a comprehensive critical
examination. Analysis of correlations between behavioral, physiological and
biochemical characters, which was made on genetically well-known material. may

be of special interest from the physiologist's point of view. In the next chapter
(author--P. M. Borodin) there is a comprehensive discussion of the bases for
planning diallele experiments and interpreting their results. Special attention
is given to the most common mistakes in using this relatively new method of
physiological experimentation, which could be used for both the study of degree
of genetic determination of a character and investigation of architectonics of
the genotype and separation of behavior and several physiological functions into
elementary components.

The next two chapters (authored by L. I. Korochkin and N. G. Kamyshev, Ye. V.
Savvateyeva, V. V. Ponomarenko)describes one of the promising directions of deve-
lopmental genetics, which investigates the effect of the genome on a character
from the standpoint of analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic relations (Chapter 4)

Chapter 6 (by L. N. Irut) deals with the current status of problems of genetics
of learning and consolidation of memory. The data obtained by means of hybrido~
logical analysis indicate that the nature of inheritance of the main parameters

70

FINIiJFIICIALIUSEZINVLY
of learning depends on the genotypic environment in which a given character is
studied. The author describes in detail a new analytical method which involves
the study of the nature of distribution of a character in a series of recombinant
lines.

Studies inthe field of genetic etiology of diseases of the nervous system and
elaboration of methods for early detection thereof is the topic of Chapter 7 (by
L. G. Romanova and L. G. Kalmykova), and considerable attention is devoted to
questions of pathophysiology of higher nervous activity in man and the house
mouse. chapter 9 deals with the genetic aspects of farm animal behavior (written
by L. A. Alekseyevich), which are related to analysis of adaptation when kept in
industrial complexes, determination of the nature of inheritance of a number of
behavioral characters and breeding animals with specific economically useful
behavioral traits.

The last chapter, "Animal Behavior as a Factor in the Process of Hicroevolution"
(by L. V. Krushinskiy and I. I. Poletayeva), occupies a special place in this
manual. The material in this chapter reflects the population-species approach

to the study of genetic behavioral distinctions of animals. and it is the most
comprehensive work on this subject in the Soviet literature. According to the
submitted data, the behavior of an individual [specimen] may determine the nature
of microevolutionary transformations in animal communities, while the breeding
value of a given phenotype (genotype) depends largely on the specific genetic
environment that thus affects formation of behavior. The latter factor is usually
underestimated in physiological experiments.

All of the foregoing warrants the opinion that publication of this volume was
needed by a wide circle of specialists studying physiology and genetics of behavior
in different sectors of the national economy.

[Text] This monograph submits the results of experimental studies conducted

by the author of operator performance in the modes of identification, recognition,
decoding and information retrieval when working with different code alphabets.

An effort was made to submit the recognition process to systems and structural
analysis. There is discussion of the place of recognition in the system of

other forms of cognitive activity. The recognition process is viewed.aa having
many levels. Investigation is made of the different operations making up the
recognition process and functional structures that express them. There is formula-
tion of ergonomic principles of building and evaluating systems of coding visual
and auditory information. This book is intended for specialists in the fields

of ergonomics, engineering and experimental psychology and engineers. It may
also be useful to psychologist-students in different specialties.

Foreword
To the bright memory of Petr Ivanovich Zinchenko

The monograph by T. P. Zinchenko constitutes a fundamental, theoretical and ex-
perimental investigation of the recognition process, which was conducted by the
author and her colleagues over a period of several years. It deals comprehensively
with recognition as a special process; its macrostructure and microstructure are
analyzed, as well as the place of recognition in the system of other mental pro-
cesses. This distinguishes the monograph to advantage from other publications
(which are very few in nunber) on the same subject that are available in the
Soviet literature.

The author explores recognition as a process with complex and multilevel struc-

ture. For this reason, the methodology of systems analysis is applied with
good justification to this study. This makes it possible to undertake development

FOI‘OFFKJAI.USE(ﬂVLY
of psychological recognition theory. It is to the credit of this book that there
is a combination of different research levels: psychophysical, psychophysiologicai,
microstructural, engineering psychology. The author also draws upon material
referable to pathology of the peripheral branch of the visual analyzer.

The first chapter of the book deals with the place of recognition in the system

of other cognitive processes: perceptive, mnemic, thinking, etc. The second chapter
merits special attention; if provides the structural and functional characteristics
of the recognition process. Recognition is explored in detail for the first time

as a multisystemic process, which contains perceptive, selective and mnemic
elements.

The use of different methodological approaches and diversified investigative
methods yielded new data, which characterize not only the psychological mechanism
of recognition, but the microstructure of attention in the recognition process.

of special interest are the general patterns demonstrated by the author with
regard to reception and processing of visual and auditory multidimensional signals.

A complete and integral description of the recognition process is obtained in the

monograph of T. P. Zinchenko by virtue of the fact that recognition is considered

not only as an independent process, but as part of processes of decoding, informa-
tion retrieval and preparation of decision.

The third chapter has an overtly practical orientation. It is concerned with
development of psychological principles of coding visual and auditory information.
The results of her investigations enabled the author to formulate the main require-
ments for coding information, which must be taken into consideration by engineer-
ing psychologists and designers, who develop the means of displaying information.

This book has an abundance of experimental data obtained on the basis of a number
of original investigative methods. The experimental facts logically ensue from
the author's theoretical constructions. In all instances, there is distinct
presentation of the hypothesis of the study, discussion and analysis of other
possible hypotheses and assumptions. This is indicative of the unity of concep-
tion of the extensive and original cycle of studies of recognition.

I am convinced that the book of T. P. Zinchenko, which constitutes a substantial
contribution to development of psychological theory of recognition, will be
welcomed by readers with interest.

Introduction

The problem of perception and recognition is among the most important ones in
psychology. Direct, sensory reflection of reality is the foundation for forming
abstract thought processes. At the same time, development of sensory processes

is of substantial importance to improvement of a subject's practical endeavors
since, as indicated already by I. H. Sechenov, "all purposeful actions are
regulated by sensations." At the present stage of development of technology,
sensory processes play as important a role in human endeavor as thinking processes.
As validly noted by B. c. Anan'yev, "the most far-reaching advances of science

and technology are intended not only for thinking, but for feeling man."

The recognition process has been drawing much attention on the part of researchers
in recent years. Since the recognition process is one of the main mental processes,
it is of definite theoretical interest to study it. On the other hand, the study
of recognition also has practical implications. The scientific and technological
revolution has led to development of new forms of labor. At the present time,
recognition really exists as a specific form of labor (for example, operator-
observer). This compels us to raise the question of demonstrating the structure

of recognition. It is imperative to take into consideration the patterns and
mechanisms of the recognition process when solving pr Klems of coding and
displaying information on indicator equipment.

means of assuring operational performance of man in the system, which also means
efficiency of operation of the entire system. The importance of working on the

tion by an operator. Moreover, the coding methods that are used affect the re-

liability and cost of information display equipment, since they determine the
type of indicator equipment.

a system of correspondences between elements of communications and combinations

of signals by which these elements are expressed. Optimality of a code implies that
it provides for maximum speed and reliability of reception and processing of in-
formation by man. In the most general form, an optimum code is one that is devel-
oped in accordance with the patterns of processes of reception and processing of
organization, in the organization of which it participates. For this reason, the
solution of the problem of optimum coding is closely linked to investigation of

Investigation of the psychological mechanisms and structure of operator performance
has occupied in recent years a central place in elaboration of theory of engineering
psychology. And, as indicated by B. P. Lomov [l], the specifics of research in
engineering psychology require investigation of how machines mediate this activity,
which includes processes of forming an image of control objects and their states,
comparison of incoming signals, retrieval of information from memory, decision
making, programming actions, evaluating results, etc.

The activities of an operator dealing with reception and processing of submitted
information include various operations: detection of signals, comparison thereof

to standards written in memory and recognition, decoding, etc. The recognition
process is an important element of this activity.

Our objective here was to investigate the psychological patterns of the recognition
process. Recognition can be defined as a process of relating directly
perceived ambient reality to perceptual and verbal standards recorded
in the individual's memory. The recognition process has a complex, multi-
level structure. For this reason, we considered it useful to draw upon the methodo-
logy of systems analysis to investigate recognition.

The systems approach implies that it is necessary to consider the phenomenon under
study from different angles. In the first place, it is a phenomenon on its own.

76

FOR OFFICJAI.US£1MVLY
IN)! 0FF1CLAI.USEZ(MﬂLY

In the second place, it isaphenomenon that is considered in a specific system and
is subject to its laws. In the third place, the synthetic aspect of studying the
phenomenon implies that it must be considered as the product of the entire set of
existing conditions, endogenous and exogneous [2].

Proceeding from the above principles, we believe performance of systems analysis of
the recognition process should proceed in the following main directions.

1. Consideration of the place of recognition in the system of other cognitive
processes.

2. Examination of the functional structure of the recognition process.

3. Investigation of recognition as a multisystem process, containing perceptive,
selective and mnemic elements.

a. Demonstration of important factors determining the structure, content and effec—
tiveness of the recognition process, investigation of these factors from the stand-
point of the nature of their influence on the recognition process and determination
of the quantitative patterns of this influence.

5. Finally, in the system of cognitive processes, recognition may emerge not only
as an independent activity, but as a special action that provides for reaching an
interim result. In this regard, it is necessary to analyse the place of recognition
in reception and processing of information and to investigate the recognition pro-
cess as an element of activity in the modes of decoding, information retrieval and
informational preparation of decision.

One of the general requirements for systems analysis of mental phenomena_is that
different levels of investigation must be combined. In our book, the recognition
process is studied in different aspects: psychophysical (determination of threshold
characteristics for different perceptive categories); psychophysiological (in order
to study coordination of functional systems implementing the recognition process);
microgeuetic (which discloses the distinctions of perceptive categories at different
stages of the recognition process); microstructural (analysis of structural organi-
zation of operations involved in reception and processing of information); use of
data on pathology which, as indicated by A. R. Luriya, "makes it possible to

break the perceptive process down into elements and examine expressly what in the
perceptive process depends on a given element"; engineering psychology (study of'
effectiveness of reception and processing of information as related to the problem
of coding and displaying information on display equipment).

As stimulus material, we used in our studies different alphabets, which are used
to develop information models: alphabetic, digital, alphabets of conventional
signs, one- and multi-dimensional alphabets made up by combining categories of
shape, size, orientation, color and brightness of an object, etc.

Since coding of incoming information is performed chiefly by means of visual sig-
nals in real control systems, investigation of reception and processing of visual
information occupies the main place in this monograph. However, considering the
advantages of an acoustical signal, such as the wide range of frequencies and in-
tensities, relative independence of spatial position, considerable imperviousness
to interference, which make it preferable in a number of situations, we also

Foreword

In the last few years, questions of engineering psychology have acquired much
importance, not only in psychology, but to some extent as the decisive factor in
development of technology. Experience has shown that technology, which is the

tool of human labor, can yield the required results only if it is properly coordi-
nated with man's psychophysiological capabilities. For this reason it is practical
necessity that determined the interest in engineering psychology, a science that

is called upon to provide for such coordination: without using the knowledge in
this field it has become impossible to develop complex control systems that would
meet current requirements.

Scientific research institutes and laboratories are seriously involved with prob-

lens of engineering psychology; they are also taken into consideration by planning
and designing organizations in development 0f man-nachine OYSCGIB. as well as those

who operate them. All these circunstances made it necessary to train specialists
in engineering psychology and to teach this discipline in technical VUZ's. A need
arose for textbooks and manuals dealing with a caurse of engineering psychology.

In 1969, we published a textbook, ”Fundamentals of Engineering Psychology," which
was intended for students in the psychology department of Tartu Universtiy, and in
1971 we published the "Brief Course of Engineering Psychology." The present book
is a substantially revised and somewhat enlarged version of this course. In the
interim years there have been many new studies in the field of engineering

psychology and a number of new books were published covering its different aspects;
All-Union standards were published, which regulated the terminology of engineering
psychology and different aspects of designing man-machine systems. All these

data were taken into consideration in the new edition of this course.

in our presentation, we tried to depart from the laboratory and fragmentary
approach to analysis of mental processes, which is partially inherent in experi-
mental psychology and extrapolated to engineering psychology. Theory of object-
related activity, which is being successfully developed by Soviet psychological
science, was the theoretical foundation of this course. For this reason, the
mental processes and characteristics of the human operator are discussed here.

as much as possible, as they directly relate to his control-related tasks with due
consideration of the goals and conditions of work, emotional manifestations gene~
rated by it and self-regulation processes. The distinctions of operator activity
proper-the specificity of goals that are set, clearcut definition of conditions
and rigid limitations on the means of achieving them--are largely instrumental

in using this approach in engineering psychology. As yet, there is no unified
and conventional structure for describing the problems and questions that this
discipline comprises. Some of its problems have not been sufficiently investi-
gated. and there is no general agreement with regard to some of them. For this
reason, in preparing this course. we tried to present, first of all, the issues
that have already been defined, either theoretically or practically, as being

the most relevant and for which there is a common point of view. The course also
includes some less studied questions that we considered promising. He did not
try to represent them as being solved and smooth over existing contradictions

for the sake of an orderly presentation; we have submitted the actual state of
affairs, voicing our attitude on this score without presuming to have definitive
solutions. In a number of cases, we used the results of our research to prove
our point of view.

Unlike other branches of psychological science, engineering psychology has one
remarkable distinction. Hhile it is usually enough for a psychologist to

discover the pattern of mental activity, the data obtained in engineering
psychologymustalso be advanced to a form that permits use thereof for making
concrete practical decisions on the design or refinement of equipment, decisions
pertaining to methods of operating it and training operators. It is necessary

to express quantitatively many of the patterns demonstrated in the course of
engineering psychological studies. In this regard, we have adhered to the follow-
ing point of view in this course: the most important thing in engineering psy—
chology is to demonstrate the mental patterns in operator performance, whereas
formalization of these patterns is a secondary problem, for the solution of

which the psychologist can call upon specialists in mathematics and engineering.
For this reason, in presenting this course we concentrated chiefly on general
principles, theoretical approaches to demonstration of the sought patterns, valida-
tion thereof, rather than a description of special algorithms of operator work,
which are used to solve different control problems.

We were governed by our previous textbooks of engineering psychology, experience
in delivering lectures on this subject at Tartu University for the last 10 years
and the advice of our colleagues in selecting the structure of this course and
order of presentation of material. Since the material presented in the "Course
of Engineering Psychology" is based on some of the general theoretical theses of
psychology, cybernetics, information theory, measurements, reliability, etc., the

For greater clarity, the order of presentation of educational material in this
course is shown in the form of a block diagram (Figure 0.1). We see that there
are four main sections. Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of the course deal with general
patterns of man's performance in a control system. Chapters 6, 5 and 6 are
concerned with different parameters [indicators] of operator and system perform-
ance. In chapters 7 and 8, there is analysis of the equipment with which the

93
FOR OFHCIAI. USE ONLY
operator comes in direct contact from the standpoint of its psychological confor-
mity to his performance. chapters 9 and lo discuss the use of the previously de-
monstrated patterns, characteristics and parameters of the operator and equipment
to describe andanalyzeoperator performance and to design [or plan] man-machine
systems.

It should be noted that the main problems of engineering psychology singled out in
this course do n0t cover all of the problems in this vast discipline. Because

of the size restrictions, the course did not include questions of setting up
experiments in engineering psychology, group operator performance, operator
training or professional screening. All these questions are important in the
field of engineering psychology, but expressly they had to be "sacrificed," since
they are discussed in general form in other courses as well: experimental, social
and pedagogic psychology and sections of industrial psychology. Incidentally, even
if all of these problems had been covered in this course, it could still not be
deemed full enough, since because of the youth of engineering psychology it is

not deemed possible to clearly outline the range of problems that are contained

in this field .

Conclusion

Thus, we have completed the presentation of the course of engineering psychology.
As we look back and sum up, let us single out some of the most important theses
that have run through all of the chapters of this course.

In presenting it, we tried to digress from the laboratory and fragmentary approach
that has been established in engineering psychology to the study of operator
performance, and to consider his different actions and different tasks related to
his entire goal-oriented activities involving the use of equipment [technology]

to reach the required results.

For this purpose, we used theory of object-related activity, which is the most
consistent with the selected approach and enables us to analyse operator work and
his interaction with the equipment he controls with consideration of both the
goals of the operator, specified conditions and requirements of his performance,
and human capabilities.

Such an approach was used in this course by means of singling out the range of
cxogenous-technical-restrictions (pertaining to promptness and precision of
actions) on operator performance, the requirements and conditions of the task

put to him, as well as the range of endogenous-psychophysiological-restrictions
(referable to the same parameters), which ensue from man's individual capabilities.
When mental processes and different parameters of operator performance are
considered in connection with these restrictions, it is possible to submit this
performance to systems analysis, taking into consideration man's characteristics
and parameters of equipment, as well as the problems that man solves using

this equipment.

Another important distinction of this course is that mental processes and para-
meterslafoperator performance are discussed with consideration of self-regulation.
Previously, little attention had been given to this aspect of operator performance
in the field of engineering psychology. For the sake of convenience of presenta-
tion and analysisof this range of problems, we arbitrarily singled out two areas

96

of self-regulation: one based on energetic processes (ensuing from physiological
changes in the body) and the other based on information processes. 0n the basis
of theoretical theses, experiments and practical examples, it was shown that not
only the area of information processes (which had been chiefly studied heretofore)
but the area of energetic processes ensuing from emotional manifestations of the
operator are important to engineering psychology. For this reason, much attention
was given to these manifestations as well in this course. The concept of signifi-
cance [relevance], which determined the operator's emotional reactions to differ-
ent communications, actions, tasks, indicators and controls, runs through all of
the chapters. The concept of significance. as it was shown, is not only a useful
tool for psychological analysis, which makes it possible to relate the different
actions of the operator to the problem he is solving, but a means of considering
the subjective distinctions of the work studied and, which is quite important,

its motivational aspect. It is of particular value to engineering psychology

that this concept can be submitted to quantitative vinterpretation.

The next important idea that has pervaded the entire course is the thesis that
investigation and evaluation of operator performance must be pursued not only from
the standpoint of his potential capabilities, but with consideration of the fact
that the operator does not always by far make use of these capabilities. It was
shown that the route toward answering the question of the extent to which an
operator will use his capacities to reach a specified goal lies on determination
of the degree of significance to him of these goals and of the tasks related to
achieving them. For this reason, investigation of the causes of delayed or in-
accurate operator actions, causes of inadequate reliability or effectiveness of
his work must be pursued not only by means of analysis of his information pro-
cesses, but by means of determining the significance to a given operator of these
actions and adequacy of these measures for actual conditions of working on the
task.

In this course, considerable attention was devoted to questions of operator adap-
tation. It was shown that this feature is manifested on all levels of his mental
activity in the control system. Thus, an operator adjusts to reception of in-
coming information, to processing it and performance of control actions on its
basis, and this adjustment is fine and flexible on different levels and at
different stages of each of these processes. As he gains experience, the
operator's control actions are transformed into appropriate operations, and

he acquires the ability to perform them instantly. It was shown that an operator
also adapts to performing entire control tasks, and it is expressly on the basis
of the requirements of these tasks (rather than the different characteristics of
indicators or controls) that he organizes his performance-its speed and precision
parameters-making use of information and energy reserves. It was also established
that the human operator inherently adapts to the entire work performed, in accord-
ance with individual capabilities and its external conditions, developing his own
individual style. Moreover, an operator is found to be capable of successfully
adjusting to disruption of working conditions and, like a truly "goal-oriented"
system, he finds the optimum raute for reaching his goal. Thus, the operator
demonstrates a vivid tendency for purposeful adaptation to the equipment he
controls and purposeful use thereof to reach a specified goal, in spite of
occurring obstacles. This voluntary and involuntary adaptation of man to equip-
ment encounters the tendency for adaptation of equipment to the capabilities

and tasks of the Operator, which is the essential objective of engineering
psychology. Hence there is anorher important thesis: research and measures

95

dealing with engineering psychology must take into consideration the operator's
inherent tendency to adjust to equipment and to the tasks performed with the use
thereof.

Such are the distinctions and main ideas of this book, to which we should like to
call the reader's attention. Presentation of thesubject of engineering psychology
from the indicated points of View. in the form of a single organised system of
knowledge. was the main objective of this course of instruction.

USING HUMAN ENGINEERING TO IMPROVE OPERATOR PERFORMANCE
Moscow VESTNIK AKADEHII NAUK SSSR in Russian No 2, Feb 81 pp 30-40

[Article by B. F. Lomov, corresponding member. USSR Academy of
Sciences: "Equipment Development and Problems of Psychology: A
Scientific Report"]

[Text] Scientific and technological progress is leading to signi-
ficant changes in industrial processes; there are also changes
taking place in the conditions and nature of equipment operators'
activities.

The most specific thing in the operators' performance is the fact

that they are not able to directly observe the controlled processes:
the operator works not with the actual objects but with models of
them; information on the objects is transmitted in code using

various devices. In order to carry out a particular control function.
the operator must not only perceive the instrument signals but he

must also decipher (decode) them. The signal decoding is, at times,
an extremely difficult task whose accomplishment requires the
expenditure of a rather large amount of time and a significant

amount of mental stress from the operator.

The changes in the conditions and nature of the equipment operator's
activities are such that he frequently has to work to the limit

of his mental ability. This fact has a negative effect on equipment
efficiency and reliability. As shown by an analysis of accidents
which occur during equipment handling, the majority of them occur
due to operator error. Acoording to American statistics. this is
the cause of about 70 percent of flying accidents, over 50 percent
of the "malfunctions" of various types of equipment and over 60
percent of naval accidents.

The mistakes occur because the operator is not able to react to

an unexpected signal in time, incorrectly perceives the signal,

does not have time to shift his attention from one set to another,
incorrectly deciphers the signal or acts by impulse under the effect
of the high emotional strain. In other words, in many cases the
causes of the mistakes are psychological in nature.

Analysts shows that attention is one of man's most "delicate"
mental functions; it "malfunctions" under the influence of very
many factors.

Figure 1 shows the changes in the level of a subject's visual
attention due to exposure to noise. Controlled measurements were
made before the exposure to noise, immediately after the exposure.
and 1/2. 1. and 2 hours after exposure. The size of the reduction

in the subject's level of attention depended upon the intensity of
the noise. The greater the intensity. the greater the reduction in
the level of attention and the longer the time for restoring it.
Let's make note of the fact that at moments of a decline in the level
of the operator's attention, mistakes also appear in his work.

Naturally. the mistakes are made by the operator himself but
sometimes it turns out that they are "provoked" by the equipment
or the industrial process. Mistakes occur either because the
information is transmitted in a form that is not suited to

human perception, or because distracting signals appear during
operations, or because a very high operating speed is required
of the individual, etc.

when new equipment or a new industrial process is being developed,

the designers unfortunately do not always think about how conditions
will turn out for performance by the individual who will have to
maintain or operate the equipment. Then, during equipment operations,
it is discovered that it is "psychologically unsuitable" for the
individual. Operation of it involves a great deal of "stress" on

the operator's memory, perception or attention.

80. with the development of equipment, there arises the very complex
(but very important) task of "integrating" it with human capabilities.
The accomplishment of this task presupposes the examination of equip-
ment operations and human performance in a single system (the "man-
machine" system).

There are various ways of improving the effectiveness of "man-machine"
systems reliability, ways which rely on the basic sciences. One of
these ways is to consider human performance and abilities when new
equipment is developed, in other words, matching the equipment and
work conditions to the individual. In this case. it is necessary

to have data on the principles of mental processes common to all
people. Another is to select and train people for specific types

of work. For this, it is necessary to have data on people's indivi-
dual psychological differences, methods of determining these
differences as well as a knowledge of training principles and
characteristics. It should be pointed out that both of these

ways do not exclude, but rather supplement, each other.

The task of finding ways of optimizing the match between equipment
and the human operator's traits and abilities is directly related

to three groups of psychological problems which are being studied

by staff members of the USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of Psych-
ology.

The first of these problems is the operator's receipt and processing
of information. In its theoretical psychological aspect, this is a
problem of perception, memory and thought.

The information required to monitor and operate equipment. as is well
known, is transmitted to the operator by certain display systems in
the form of an information model. The first requirement for the
model is that it properly display the characteristics of the environ-
ment and the controlled objects. But, a human operator works with
this model. This means that the model must be constructed in such a
manner that it ensures timely and accurate perception of it.

Therefore, while selecting a method for transmitting the informa

tion. it is necessary to know precisely how it will be perce sad by
man. In other words, it is necessary to consider the "chain":
controlled entity--information model-~operator perceptionnof the model.
The first link in this "chain" is a problem for the engineering
sciences while the second is a problem for psychology. No matter

how well the first link is designed, the efficiency and reliability

of the entire system will be low if the second link "malfunctions."

The bottom line for the entire system depends upon how well both

links are matched with each other.

The information transmitted to the human operator. as is well known,
is encoded using various values for certain physical values (sound,
light, etc.). In developing a signal alphabet, it is frequently
assumed that the physical @bjective) values are directly and
innediately reflected by the individual, that is, it is believed
that the relationship between the objective and subjective values

is a linear one. However, research shows that this is not so.

The actual alphabet used by the individual to process information

is formed on the basis of so-called subjective scales which are
developed in the individual's head.

Research conducted at the Institute of Pscyhology on the subjective
scaling processes has shown that the subjective scales are different
when the individual accomplishes different tasks. 1he scales are signal
discrimination, categorization and evaluation scales. Moreover,
while the discriminattion scales bear a logarithmic relationship to
signal size. the categorization and evaluation scales hear an
etponential relationship (the.exponents are.different for signals

of different modalities). When a physical alphabet of signals is
being developed. it is important to know what subjective scales

an individual will use to perceive them.

One of the operator's difficult jobs is the one whose performance
requires him to receive weak signals which, on top of being weak,
appear against background noise. In this case. when working

in the "threshold area" (at the boundary of human perceptual ability).
part of the signals are detected by the operator while part are missed:
in some cases, there are false alarms: there was no signal. only
noise. but it seemed to the operator that there was a signal.

Tho Institute of Psychology's research on operator detection of weak
sounds against background noise has revealed a definite relationship
between signal detection threshold and frequency. This research

has also uncovered several possibilities for improving the detection
or weak sounds by using the operating -principles of the sensory
systems (Figure 2).

ﬁne of the general principles of the perceptual processes and
related attention is that their level varies over time. At some

with a drop, roughly speaking, in the brain's "voltage" which varies
periodically.

Information 61 play systems have traditionally been created basically
by considering visual perception. The capabilities of the other
sensory organs are not yet being used enough; however. each of them
has its own special features whose use could have a significant
impact. At times. signal redundancy (visual and auditory. auditory
and tactile. etc.) is effective.

Here's an example. The task of the operator controlling a system
was to match one moving signal with another moving signal during

a specified time. Both objects were only displayed on a visual
display. With this method of information input, the operator
correctly accomplished the task in only eight percent of the cases.
Psychologists recommended that the visual signal be supplemented with
an audio signal (with specially selected characteristics). As a
result. the task was accomplished by the operator in 86 percent of
the cases.

From psychology's point of view, here is another very important case--
showing the operator the final results of his actions. It is the
Image of these results that "organize" the entire system of mental
processes which control the individual's actions. It turns out

that it is not so important for optimum task accomplishment to per-
coive the actual status of the object as it is to perceive its
deviation from the desired status and to perceive the ultimate

results of one's actions. In other words, the operator evaluates
signals not in isolation but relative to the assigned task.

In the process of his work, the individual not only perceives but
also stores and processes the information received. A significant
number of mistakes occur because the proper information is not
extracted from the individual's memory at a particular time or

the perceived information is incorrectly deciphered.

vor a long time, there was an opinion in psychology that memory

was a kind of homogeneous function, so to speak. However, experimental
research has shown that it is necessary to indicate at least two
information storage "units"--a short-term and a long-term one. Short
term memory is the retention of information just long enough to per-
form a particular, isolated act. As shown by experiments, the capacity
of this memory is negligible; it is limited to 7 i 2 units. Short-
tcrm memory is "delicate"; during strong emotional (stress) reactions.
it can "malfunction“; that is, a strong emotion can "dislodge" the
information stored in the memory. The individual can even "lose"

the purpose of the act being performed. And this leads to chaotic
movements and mistakes.

Let's give an example which testifies to the importance of considering
the capacity of human memory when designing new equipment. To optimize
pilot decision-making, a method of displaying information on the
windshield was developed for several aircraft types. It was antici-
pated that this would free the pilot of the need to frequently shift
his attention and would, thereby, ensure his uninterrupted visual
spatial orientation. Fifteen values were put on the glass and, as

is well known, this significantly exceeds the capacity of human short-
term memory. As a result, flying accuracy declined, the error rate
increased and pilot "malfunction" reaction time increased. A redesign
of the information display based on data on perception, attention

and memory made it possible to increase the accuracy of course cruise
ing by 25 percent, it reduced pilot reaction time to an emergency
signal by a factor of approximately 10, it freed additional time for
observation (about 30 percent), etc. And, of special importance was
the significant reduction in the pilot's emotional strain.

Information processing includes various aspects of the thinking

process. It may take the form of operating with either ideas (operat-
ing with visual images) or with symbols or systems of symbols (in a
logical, verbal form). In the operator's work, these aspects are
integrated, sometimes rather uniquely. When the "man-machine“ system
is being developed, it is important to have a clear idea of what
thinking operations the operator will have to perform and in what

form he will have to perform them.

Anticipation, or predicting the course of events (advance reflection).
is extremely important in the operator's work. Research shows that
interruptions in the operator's work occur especially frequently when
the opportunity for anticipation is hampered. This occurs when each

of the operator's individual acts is strictly "regulated" by signals
appearing at each specific moment, that is, when the individual is

put in a "signal-response" operating mode.

The experimental data make it possible to talk about different levels
of anticipation. The first level is the unconscious (subliminal level),
the second is perception, the third is conception and finally. there

is the level of thinking in words. Each of these levels has its own
"resolution" or range of anticipation. It is important to note that

the ability to anticipate makes it possible for the individual to

106_

funullun with a shortage of information and also to regenerate in—
formation which is broken up in transmission. Obviously, it is
necessary to develop information display systems so that they pro-
vide the operator an ability not only for signal discrimination and
identification but also for anticipation. Research conducted at

the Institute of Psychology has shown that it is possible to rather
actively manage the process of anticipation. that is, affect the
efficiency of information processing by changing the individual's
work environment and the methods of transmitting information to him.

The second group of psychological problems related to the task of
matching equipment and industrial processes to the human operator's
traits and abilities consists of an assessment of the mental "cost"
of the actions being performed; in other words, what does the
accuracy and speed of the action being performed cost the operator
(in the sense of his mental strain). These are problems of the
lndividuafs mental states (especially the problem of so-called
emotional stress).

At the Institute of Psychology, studies were conducted of the pilot's
emotional state in case of an equipment malfunction during actual
flight. It was established that in these cases the individual usually
takes his bearings not by relying on instrument readings but by
relying on his own direct sensations (which sometimes significantly
hinders proper decision making). Moreover, the stress especially
increases if the individual does not receive immediate information on
the results of his actions.

Laboratory studies conducted at the Institute of Psychology have
revealed a rather good correlation between the level of the indhdduaPs
mental strain and the quality of his performance. This makes it
possible to predict the quality of an operator's performance based on
an evaluation of his mental state. Now, we are faced with the task
of developing an automatic system for monitoring the individual's
mental state. It will make it possible to continually track the
dynamics of the individual's state and, depending upon the results,
change, for example, the flow of information being directed to him,
redistribute the workload between individual operators, vary the work
rate or switch the information from one set of sensory organs to
others.

The third group of psychological problems involve the task of operator
selection and training. The accomplishment of these tasks must be
based upon basic research on the individual psychological differences
among people and on the principles for forming and developing voca-
rionally important traits.

It is well known that there are extremely large differences among
people in the statistics on perception, memory, thinking, emotional
stability, peculiarities of spatial orientation, etc. Based on
psychological research, several ways have taken shape of developing

a typology of people based on their mental characteristics, that is,
"dividing" them into specific classes, which significantly facilitates
the task of selecting people for specific types of work.

Lvl'n look at one of the experiments which illustrates people's
individual differences. The experiment describes differences in
people's estimate of the spatial location of objects during a change
in the gravitational effect. During the experiment (Figure 4),

the subjects were located in a closéd space for an extended period

of time (the experiments were conducted on a yacht). The room that
the subjects were in changed its position (for example, it was tilted
at a particular angle). Under these conditions, the people had to
accomplish different tasks. One of the tasks was for the subjects

to put a rod into the vertical position by manipulating the handles.

Figure a shows the situation where the room was tilted at 15 degrees.
During the exneriments, it was established that some people took their
hearings from gravitational signals (Line 1), others took them from
visual signals. from the inside (Line 2). and still others "slipped"
from one method to the other (Line 3).

The study of individual psychological differences among people is a
necessary condition for a rational selection of them for specific

types of work. Let's mention that until now this selection has fre-
quently been based only upon an evaluation of the individual's physical
health; meanwhile, it is people's psychological traits which are at
least as important, if not more so.

At the Institute of Psychology of the USSR Academy of Sciences, studies
are under way in this area and they are having a considerable impact.
For example, the system of principles developed at the institute for
vocational-psychological selection of entrants to special educational

institutions made it possible to reduce the number of first-year
dismissals by a factor of 2 and to improve the students' progress.

The hardest part of the job at present is finding effective methods
of psychological diagnosis. For the future expansion of research
to evaluate the individual's psychological features, the Institute
of Psychology needs the assistance of interested parties.

But. the special selection of people for a specific type of work is
only half of the job; these people still have to be trained. The
acuteness of the training problem is dictated by the fact that the
rates of equipment development are very high. Therefore, the develop-
ment of methods for accelerated specialist training and retraining

is especially important. This in turn presupposes a knowledge of.

the psychological principles for developing specific sets of vocation-
ally important traits in the individual. specifically, developing
vocational skills.

As shown by studies, the process of acquiring a skill is not simply
"rote learning" of an action. During training, a reorganization of
mental processes and their corresponding methods of acting takes place
in the individual.

Figure 5 is a graph of operator training for the skill of working
with a flow sheet. During a specific period of time. the operator
must detect the disturbance and control it.

At first, the trainee works by components, as if scanning the {low
sheet component by component. from trial to trial, the efficiency
of his actions increases. But then the time arrives when there is

a temporary decline in the efficiency of his actions. At that time.
it seems that there is a reorganization of the operator's method

of acting; he attempts to combine the components into groups and
then to work with these groups. This reorganization makes it
possible for him to increase the efficiency of his actions. Later.
there is another slight drop in efficiency. It involves a new
reorganization of the method of action: the trainee is beginning

to "grasp" the entire situation as a whole--to operate simultaneously,
which, in the final analysis, provides a further increase in the
efficiency of his actions.

The reorganization of the individual's methods of acting and the
reorganization of their related mental processes is a given. general
law. It is very important to consider this reorganization during
the training process in order to find procedures which will make it
possible to accelerate the transition from one phase of training to
another, more effective one.

The results of psychological research--results which are uncovering
general and special laws of human mental processes and states, the
common and individual human traits for receiving and processing infor-
mntion and also the change and evolution of the individual's vocational
traits--is being used on a rather wide-spread basis in various fields
of human performance and has a definite economic impact.

But, the issue is not just one of economic impact; it is even more
important that the problems being solved by psychologists are helping
maintain people's mental health and capacity for work.

Here's a few words about the Institute of Psychology's plans and
prospects for studying the problems listed. Members of the institute's
staff will continue research on the problems of human information
reception and processing. At the same time. plans call for more
widespread development of the work to study problems involving human

Overall. research on human performance within "man-machine" systems
is a good field for integrated studies which may bring together
specialists from_the social, natural and engineering sciences.

* a t
The speaker responded to questions from Academician S. N. Vernov
on the enhanced "psychological compatibility" between computers and
their operators; from Academicians Ye. P. Velikhov and
P. 0. Kapitsa on the study of psychological problems involving
the design of control systems for various processes (specifically.
the development of an automated monitoring system for the human
brain's bioelectrical performance) as well as techniques for optimum
human "collaboration" with automated systems; and from Academician
H. A. Markov on the level of accuracy of data obtained from
psychological research.

In opening the discussion, Academician P. N. Fedoseyev, vice-
president of the USSR Academy of Sciences. suggested that a
special resolution be adopted on B. P. Lomov's scientific report,

a resolution which would highlight the basic areas of psychological
research on the problems of the man-equipment-interface. It is
necessary to do this because the problems raised in the report are
very important and urgent ones but the solution to many of them is
still in the initial stages. The goal of the present discussion

at the USSR Academy of Sciences Presidium was precisely to speed
up this research.

P. N. Fedoseyev made the following suggestions.

Recognize the need to increase research on problems involving operator
performance on up-to-date equipment.

Concentrate the efforts of scientists primarily on solutions to the
most important problems. such as. the human processes of receiving.
storing and processing information, scientific principles of operator
selection and training. the dynamics of human mental states and the
pnyrholuglcal aspects of joint operator performance.

Set up integrated studies of these problems with the participation of
phvsiologists and specialists in human genetics. social psychology
and sociology. Commission the Institute of Psychology of the USSR
Academy of Sciences. along with the Academy's departments of physi-
ology and biology and institutes of sociology. and the Academy of
Educational Sciences to develop concrete proposals on the organi-
zation of integrated research.

improve the supply of the Institute of Psychology's technical equip-
ment: provide assistance in developing special equipment to conduct
psychological studies. To this end. commission the Institute of
Psychology to prepare concrete proposals and commit the appropriate
academic organizations to provide assistance to the institute.

Support the Institute of Psychology's initiative to establish
psychological problem laboratories. groups and institute branches
during 1981-1982: on psychological diagnosis in Yaroslavl'. on
applied psychology in Cor'kiy and on measurement of human operator
psychological performance in Saratov.

It is also necessary to express the desire that the USSR Ministry
of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education examine the issue
of establishing departments at leading institutes of higher
engineering education to train specialists in the field of
engineering psychology.

Academician A. P. Aleksandrov, president of the USSR Academy of
Sciences. pointed out that in the development of power plant
control systems, there are rather frequent difficulties involving
the fact that the psychological aspects of the complex equipment
operator's actions have not yet been studied, recommendations have
not yet been made, and experience which could be applied has not
been stored “Po This forces us to build very complex simulators,

but even this does not always have positive results.

For example, when routine information on plant status was "supported"
by emergency warning signals providing evidence that certain
parameters exceeded the norm and it was necessary to turn the
plant off, the operators did not react to these signals rather
frequently. This was specifically accounted for by the fact that
the particular monotony of monitoring plant operations at the
control console led to a short "failure" of operator perception
(sometimes, it even led to dozing), to a situation where the
operator did not completely perceive the signal. The visual
signal had to be "reinforced" with an audio signal. But. even

in this case. the operator was not able to immediately "plug into"
the work rhythm accurately; he began to act hastily and. as a
result, made quite a lot of mistakes. This finally made it
necessary to change over to a system where the operator was

used in such a manner that he did not affect the plant directly
but through a plant operating mode selector (that is, the operator
only sets the goal and the automatic equipment itself "selects"

the proper procedure for changing plant operations from one mode
to another).

In this respect. the question arises: wouldn't it be simpler to
eliminate the individual altogether from any participation in the
plant control process and just leave the machine? This question
also concerns automated monitoring of human mental states--after
all, this is by no means an easy problem. In the final analysis,
it turned out that it was more advantageous (and more reliable)
to retain a system of control with human participation. where the
individual can duplicate the response to an emergency signal.
However, it is necessary to emphasize that finding an optimal
solution in the development of the "man-equipment control" system
is a very difficult. delicate problem.

During the investigation of the circumstances of one of the last
mishaps at the American Three-Mile Island nuclear plant. for
example. it was revealed that such an "avalanche" of signals

"fell upon" the operator at the time of the accident that he was
not able to make the proper response to them (in his words. the
abundance of signals brought him to such a state that he wanted

to blow-up the panel). When we developed the control console
where principles of symmetry were observed (right and left consoles
with their mirror displays of each other). this led to incessant
operator errors. It turned out that it was more advisable to

make not mirror displays on the consoles but a sort of cooy of each
of them.

These examples attest to the critical need for serious psychological
analysis of all feasible control systems and the development of
concrete recommendations to design optimal models of them.-consider-
ing the special features of human perception and response. This

is one of the major goals of the Institute of Psychology. It is
precisely in this area that the institute should closely review

its plans for scientific work and select the most important and
critical research areas.

I think it is necessary to concur with P. N. Fedoseyev's proposal
and adopt a special resolution on B. F. Lomov's scientific
report.

Academician V. S. Semenikhin talked about the need for solving the
range of problems involving control of modern automated systems
where the operator has to process hundreds of reports within a

very short period of time. This is the aspect that has been worked
on the least right now, he emphasized. We need recommendations
which are not based on intuition but on concrete. in-depth
psychological research which would help the operator extract

from the enormous flow of information that which is required for
de« ision making.

no A. P. Alcksandrov's remark that the development of such a system
will evidently require preliminary processing of information and
input of it in a form where the operator is faced with alternative
decisions and is shown the results of his actions. V. S. Semenikhin
stated that. even in this case, there were still a lot of subjective
cases of an intuitive approach to an assessment of the situation.
In order to make the task more concrete for the designers of control
systems, he noted. it was necessary to have a knowledge of the laws
based on psychological studies of human capabilities.

A. P. Aleksandrov pointed out that, in his opinion. alternative
formulations of the problems were also possible (formulations which,

perhaps, were sometimes not very well supported but which werethenwre
effective of those available). These possibilities should also

he considered. -

attention to the development of psychologically warranted
recommendations which will make it possible to build technical
devices guaranteeing a high degree of efficiency of control
equipment. It cited the most important and urgent problems
upon which the efforts of psychologists should be concentrated.

The advisability of establishing integrated research in the

fields of human psychology. physiology and genetics as well as
education and sociology was emphasized. To these ends. the

USSR Academy of Sciences In:titute of Psychology, in conjunction
with the Academy's Department of Physiology, Department of General
Biulogy. Department of Philosophy and Law. as well as the USSR
Academy of Pedagogical Sciences, should develop concrete suggestions
to organize integrated research. '

instructions were issued to take steps to equip the USSR Academy of
Sciences Institute of Psychology with the equipment required to
develop a system for automated psychological experiments. The

USSR Academy of seiences Institute of Psychology. in conjunction
with the Academy's Council on Scientific Instrument Engineering

and the Academy's Engineering Association,were commissioned to
prepare recommendations on the design of special equipment to
conduct psychological research.

The Academy's social science sections and Department of Philosophy
and Law were commissioned to prepare for review by a session of

the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences the issue of setting
up laboratories of the branches of the Institute of Psychology:

on psychological diagnosis in Yaroslavl'. on applied psychology

in Cor'kiy and on measurement of the human operator's psychological
characteristics in Saratov.

It was recommended to request the USSR Ministry of Higher and Secondary
Specialized Education to review the issue of developing special depart-
ments in the country's leading institutions of higher engineering
education to train specialists in engineering psychology.

Followup on performance of this decree is assigned to the Social
Sciences Section of the USSR Academy of Sciences Presidium.

Brief Description:

This textbook presents the main points of Soviet military psychology and education
science in conformity with the curriculum at higher conlmnd and engineering schools.
Advicv and recommendations on teaching and training enlisted personnel and non-

commissioned officers are presented on the basis of practical experience in combat
and political training of Soviet Armed Forces personnel. This textbook is in-

tended for personnel enrolled at higher command and engineering schools. It can be

recommended to officers of military units and naval ships, as well as to persons
enrolled at party schools.

INTRODUCTION

The Soviet Armed Forces are called upon reliably to defend the socialist homeland

and to maintain a continuous state of combat readiness guaranteeing an immediate
rebuff to any aggressor.

An important feature of the contemporary development of the USSR Armed Forces is a
continuous improvement in their technical equipment. V. I. Lenin considered this
to be one of the main indicators of the defense capability of the state. "The very
finest army and persons most dedicated to the cause of the revolution," he stated,
"will be immediately annihilated by the enemy if they are inadequately armed,

provisioned, and trained."1 The Communist Party of the Soviet Union rigorously
follows these Lenin precepts.

.Attaching great importance to technical equipment of the USSR Armed Forces, the CPSU
at the same time has always believed and continues to believe that weapons can be

a powerful means of national defense only if army and navy personnel are deeply
aware of their great responsibility to the homeland and possess a consummate mastery
0[ their weapons. "A solid fusion of a high degree of technical equipment, military
expertise and indomitable morale -- this is the fighting potential of the Soviet
Armed Forces,"2 stressed L. I. Brezhnev in the CPSU Central Committee Acc0untability
Report to the 26th CPS!) Congress. For this reason the party devotes unrelenting at-
tention to training and indoctrination of Soviet military personnel and increasing
the combat readiness of the USSR Armed Forces.

Demands on the content, quality and effectiveness of work in the area of Communist
indoctrination of Soviet servicemen have increased in present-day conditions. CPSU

120

FOR 0F?1CJAI.USEGDNLY
decisions have stressed time and again that the heart of ideological and political
indoctrination work has been and remains formation in Soviet citizens of a sci-
entific philosophical outlook, total dedication to the cause of the party and Com-
munist ideals. a love of the socialist homeland, and proletarian internationalism.
Also of great importance in indoctrination of personnel is development of a
vigorous political attitude, total dedication to the military duty, a high degree of
discipline, political vigilance, hatred toward imperialism, readiness and willing-
ncss to come to the defense of the homeland at all times.

In order to accomplish these important tasks of Communist indoctrination of Soviet
citizens, army and navy personnel, the CPSU Central Committee considers it essential
continuously to raise the scientific level of ideological and political indoctrina-
tion work, further to strengthen its bond with practical realities, and to develop
the aggressive character of the indoctrination process.

Officer cadres play the principal role in development of the Soviet servicemen and
in ensuring the continuous combat readiness of the USSR Armed Forces. Officer
cadres train and indoctrinate army and navy personnel and direct the daily activi-
ties of their subordinates.

Troop training and indoctrination are organised and conducted on a scientific basis.
v. I. Lenin emphasized that a modern army cannot be built without science.3 These
words ring particularly true today. "Soviet military science," notes USSR Minister
of Defense Mar SU D. F. Ustinov, member of the CPSU Central Committee Politburo,
"reliably serves, as it always has, the cause of practical accomplishment of the
tasks facing the Armed Porces.‘ '

Niiitary psychology and military education science play an important role in train-
ing and indoctrination of personnel.

Military psychology studies the laws and patterns of development and manifestation
of the psychological features of the individual servicemen and military collectives
in conditions of peacetime and wartime. Military education science investigates
the essence, content, laws and patterns of training and indoctrination of ser-
vicemen and military collectives. It substantiates the principles, forms, methods
and means of training and indoctrination of servicemen and military collectives.
Working in close coordination, military psychology and military education science
elaborate the conditions and ways of effectively influencing the consciousness and
behavior of military personnel for the purpose of forming excellent moral-political
and fighting qualities in these personnel.

Military psychology and education science incorporate advances made in many sci-
ences dealing with man, the collective, their labor and combat activities.

Military psychology and pedagogy as sciences are closely linked with the theory and
practice of party-political work. At the same time party-political work in the mili-
tary produces fine, positive results if it is performed taking into account the

laws and patterns revealed by military psychology and education science. Army Gen

A. A. Yepishev, chief of the Main Political Directorate of the Soviet Army and Navy,
notes that "successes in combat, moral-political and psychological training of
personnel are due to a significant degree to the fact that their activities are

grounded on scientific theory and practice of party-political work and take into ac-

count thespoints and conclusions of Soviet military psychology and education
at iuucc. "

ProfOund mastery of military psychology and education science is a serious matter.

In order successfully to train and indoctrinate his subordinates, it is not enough
for an officer to possess a certain sum total of knowledge which he acquires at mili-
tary educational institutions and in independent study of the literature. As is in-
dicated by practical experience, he must develop in himself a psychological-
pedagogic mode of thinking -- the ability to think in terms of psychology and educa-
tion science in accomplishing training and indoctrination tasks and in daily supervi-
sion of his men, just as he thinks, for example, in the terms and concepts of tac-
tics in solving tactical problems.

This textbook will assist future officers in this. It contains a systematized
presentation of military psychology and military education science in conformity
with the curriculum faringher military schools and reveals the fundamental
psychological-pedagogic laws and patterns forming the foundation of successful
service and combat activity of military personnel, the essence, forms and methods of
training, indoctrination and moral-psychological preparation of personnel, cohesion

of military collectives, strengthening of discipline and combat readiness of units
and subunits. '

Knowledge of military psychology and education science is transformed into firm
concepts and ideas, into a psychological-pedagogic mode of thinking only when the
student systematically assimilatesthe curricular material and thoroughly understands
theoretical content and practical significance. This is promoted by the student
thoroughly thinking through each and every lecture, independent study of the recom-
mended literature, as well as regular, well—prepared presentations at seminar
classes.

The habit of reading on a regular basis newly-appearing works on military psychology
and education science, active participation in a military psychology and education
science study group, and systematic reading of war memoir literature, which con-
tainsaawealth of experience in training, indoctrination and guidance of the ac-
tivities of personnel during the years of the Great Patriotic War -- all this helps
gain a better understanding of the service performance, combat activities and daily
life of personnel, as well as training and indoctrination tasks assigned to Soviet
Army and Navy officers, and helps understand the essence of a psychological-
pedagogic approach to accomplishing them. Very helpful in mastering military
psychology and education science is viewing and discussion, from the standpoint of
psychological-pedagogic science, of training and feature films dealing with the
life and activities of Soviet servicemen.

A decisive role in mastering curricular material on military psychology and educa-

tion science is played by practical application of knowledge obtained on these sub-

Jects and work with personnel during a tour of duty in line units, in daily train-
ing and service activities.

Vigorous and systematic independent work by cadets and young officers in order to
master military psychology and education science will produce the desired results -—

122

FOI.OFTWCJAI.IEHE(MULY
military-psychological and pedagogic knowledge will be he transforned into their
personal views, into a system of psychological-pedagogic thinking. And this is the
foundation of effective, genuinely innovative work in the area of training and in-
doctrinating subordinates and guiding their activities.
