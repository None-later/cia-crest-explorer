[Article: "to Increase the Effectiveness of Agricultural Production")

[Texti Comrade l..I. Breshnev'e report on the July (1978) Plenum of the

cc CPSU and the Plenua's decree 'vn Further Develop-ant of USSR Agriculture"
node a profound iapression on the workers of our country. This historic
document has been cowletely approved by the Soviet people, who have directed
their efforts touard solution of the neat urgent problem of agricultural
production, elimination of weak points, and lore effective use of scene to
ensure progress in this extremely i-portant meter of the scone-y. In
accordance with the party's agrarian policy, capital investment in agricul-
tural production is constantly increasing. While in the 7th Five-Year Plan,
the proportion of the total value of capital investnenta was 20 percent,
during the 8th Five-Year Plan it was 23 percent; in the 7th, 26 percent, and
in the 10th it is more than 27 percent.

hiring the last ten years such has been done to create a modern industrial
base for agriculture. "Previously we had no such specialised, independent
major fields as water conservation, land reclamation, engineering for
agriculture and fodder production, agricultural construction, nixed feed
production, and the nicrobiological industry," said I..l. Brezhnev in his
report. "Now we do!" The report further said that the experience of years
past indicates that the capacity of the industrial fields supplying agricul-
ture dust be increased lore vigorously.

This goal is being net by the decree of the CC CPSU andthe USSR Council of
Ministers ”0n Further Development of Fodder Supplements, Crop-Protective
Agents and Other Products of the Microbiological Industry in 1975-1978,"
which was approved by the July Plenum of the CC CPSU. This docuunt states
that the realization of the resolutions adopted by the party and the govern-
ment on the creation and accelerated developnent of the microbiological
industry has made it possible to increase significantly the production of
fodder yeast, nonaedical antibiotics, enzyme preparations and vitaine and
to organize the industrial production of fodder concentraticns of lysine,
prenixes and nicrobiological crop-protective agents.

The decree further states that use of the products of the microbiological
industry is highly influential in improving the effectiveness of agricul-
tural production, particularly in stock breeding.

This high evaluation of the role of the microbiolgical industry is inspiring
its workers to new achievements of labor and overfulfillment of production
plants, first and foremost those for fodder yeast.

As a result of protein scarcity, enormous overexpenditure of fodder is going
on. In order to eliminate this deficiency, along with expanding plantings

of leguminous and oil-producing crops, alfalfa, clover, rape and soy, it is
necessary to take all possible measures to increase the industrial production
of protein substances. Use of fodder yeast as a supplement in rations for
animals and birds, for example, not only economises on the usual fodder, but
also sybstantially increases the quantity of meat, milk and eggs obtained.

The CC CPSU and the USSR Council of Hinisters has given the Main Administra-
tion for the Microbiological Industry the responsibility for implementing
new production capacities in 1981-1985 of 1,210,000 tons of fodder yeast.
This goal must be fulfilled not only by constructing new, but also by
expanding and reconstructing existing, enterprises. In addition, in order
to sntizfy the needs of agriculture, it is necessary to increase on a
significant scale the production of amino acid premixes, enzyme preparations,
fodder antibiotocs and vitamins. microbiological crop-protective agents,
and bacterial fertilizers. Thus, in 1981-1985, new production capacities

of 21,000 tons of lysine, 164,000 tons of premixes, and 7,300 tons of micro-
biological crop-protective agents are to be implemented.

The necessary raw material resources have been allotted for realising the
wide program of developing the production of microbiological products. In
1985, for example, different ministries and departments will provide the
nicrobiological industry with 9,199,000 solid cubic meters of technological
raw materials, including 3,258,000 cubic meters of chips, 5,961,000 cubic
meters of sawdust, 1,765,000 tons of ccrn cobs, 668,000 tons of rice husks,
759,000 tons of sunflower husks, and 1,730,000 tons of cotton pods.

In the eleventh five-year plan, a 2.9 billion are earmarked for the
development of the microbiological industry. Goals for constructing and
implementing new capacities and organizing serial production of technological
equipment have been set by the construction and industrial ministries. The
decree of the CC CPSU and the USSR Council of Ministers states that the
materials, resources and equipment for the creation of enterprises and units
of the microbiological industry must be received first and foremost by the
contract construction organizations.

Considerable funds will be invested in the reconstruction of existing
hydrolysis industry enterprises with the aim of increasing their output

of products for agriculture. new produztion capacities for fodder yeast
must be created in the Arkhangel'skiy, Bobruiskiy, Biryusinskiy, 21minskiy,

2
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
lvdel'skiy, Oneshskiy, Tavdinskiy and Nlinskiy hydrolysis and the Kanskiy,
Krasuoyarskiy and Kirovskiy chemical plants. The Khekasskiy and Khorskiy
hydrolysis plants will become major suppliers of premises. New high-power
enterprises will be built in Tomskiy Oblast and Krasnoyarskiy Kraynthe
Tonmko-Asinovskiy and Hakalekovo-Yeniseyskiy hydrolysis yeast factories,
each of which will give agriculture 80,000 tons of protein-vitamin fodder
yeast annually.

In reconstructing existing hydrolysis plants and building new ones,
application rust be found for the latest achievements of science and
technology, so that the new capacities are really new, meeting the needs

of the times, and highly effective from the point of view of economics and
the quality of products manufactured by them. This obligates the scientific
research and designing organizations to examine their proposals and decisions
once again and, with great creative enthusiasm and a feeling of great respon-
sibility, to work on implementing the goals of the party and the government.

The indicated decree of the cc CPSU and the USSR Council of Ministers
entrusts the Main Administration of the Microbiological Industry of the
USSR Council of Ministers with developing, with the participation of the
USSR Acaduy of Sciences and interested industries and departments, and
with approving before 1 October 1978 in agreement with the USSR State

Com-.ittee on Science and Technology and the USSR Cosplan, measures to ensure
in 1978-1985:

further development and increase in the effectiveness of scientific research,
experimental~industrial, and design work in the field of manufacturing
products of microbiological synthesis;

significant increase in technico-economic indexes of microbiological
production;

attaiment in the shortest time possible of a high level of production for
lysine, nonmedical antibiotics, microbiological crop-protective agents,
enzyme preparations and bacterial fertilizer;

increase in the quality of products turned out;

development of highly productive and stable industrial strains of micro-
organisms;

more complete use of wastes from the enterprises of the microbiological
industry and development and creation of wastefree technological processes
for manufacture of microbiological products:

decrease in outlays of raw materials, fuel, and electrical energy per unit
or production;

3

development and creation of highly productive technological lines with units

of high unit-capacity and equipping the enterprises of the microbiological
industry with them;

decrease in outlays of stainless steel per unit of product output;

creation of technological processes of microbiological synthesis which use
new types of raw materials;

the creation of qualitatively new products of microbiological synthesis
necessary for agriculture;

expansion of the application and effective use of microbiological products
in agriculture, light industry, the food, meat and milk, and fish industries
and in other branches of the national economy.

The development, manufacture and testing of new engineering is an urgent
matter. In particular, it is very iaportant for the hydrolysis industry to
receive an experimental model of a yeast-growing apparatus for processing
concentrated hydrolysis media with an output of 50 tons per day from the
"Dserzhinskkhimash" Plant in 1979, and to test it at the Volzhskiy hydro-
lysis yeast plant in 1980, so that the corresponding enterprise of the
Ministry of chemical and Petroleum Machine Building can organise serial
production of this apparatus in 1981.

The goal of the new engineering also includes developing initial requirements,
performing technical documentation, manufacturing the experimental mdel,
testing it, end organizing serial production of continuous output reactors

for enzyme hydrolysis of pulp-containing raw materials with an output of

6,000 liters per hour; purification systems for exhaust air from dispersion
driers with an output of up to 300,000 cubic meters per hour, and other highly
effective equipment. The Ministry of Chemical and Petroleum Machine Building,
the Ministry of Machine Building for Light and Food Industry and Household
Appliances and the USSR State Omittee for Material and Technical Supply have
been entrusted with manufacturing and supplying the Main Administration of

the Microbiological Industry with a number of complex technological lines

in 1981-1985, among them three lines for the hydrolysis industry with an
output of 12,000 tons of furfurol and 38,000 tons of fodder yeast per year;
two lines for manufacturing xylitol with an output of 10,000 tons per year
and four lines for manufacturing premixes with an output of 36,000 tons per
year.

The biochemists of the cellulose and paper industry are also contributing
to solve the protein problem. Through maximal use of sulphite waste liquor
and pre-hydrolysates, its enterprises will bring the manufacture of fodder
yeast up to 215,000 tons by 1985. In order to fulfill this goal, envisaged
by the indicated decree of the cc CPSU and the USSR Council of Ministers,
collectives of hydrolysis factories and biochemical shops of the pulp and
paper industry will have to accomplish significant work in perfecting
engineering and technology and in modernizing equipment. Institutes in

[Article by A.K. Sdomina of the All-Union Scientific and Research Institute
of the Hydrolysis Industry; A.A. Hisyukov, SJ. Borisevich of the Leningrad
Hydrolysis Plant]

[Text] Growing fodder-protein yeast on hydrolytic media in air lift
apparatus is accoqanied by foam formation, which, as is known, is a
positive event. In the stage of yeast separation, however, the foam must
be extinguished. were are several methods for extinguishing it, the most
widely used being the mechanical and chemical methods.

While in mechanical foam extinction, the foam bubbles are destroyed by means
of mechanical devices (bearers, paddles, etc.), the chemical method of foam
reduction is more coupler, depending on many factors.

According to the data (1), two variants of the action of chemical antifosma
are possible. The first is when a drop of antifoam penetrates the film
between two bubbles and spreads as a thick double film; the tension created
during the spreading mechanically destroys the film. The second variant is
when a drop of antifoam penetrates into liquid foam but spreads to a limited
extent, forming a mixed monolayer with the frothing agent. If this monolayer
has poor coherence, the foam will be destroyed.

Con-on to both methods is the fact that the antifoam penetrates the film
between two bubbles. This capacity of the substance may he expressed as
the coefficient of penetration B. As soon as the drop penetrates the
film, its capacity for spread is determined by the coefficient of spread S.
E and S can be expressed as surface tension and tension on the surface of
the partition between the antifoam and the frothing agent:

where ,4: - the surface tension of the frothing agent;
H - the surface tension of the antifoen;
\‘l'd I surface tension of the partition between the antifosn and
the frothing agent.

As can be seen fro- Foruule l, in order for the penetration coefficient B

to be positive, it is necessary to have an antifosn with low surface tension.
And in order for the spread coefficient 5 to have a positive value, substances
also having hydrophilic properties are necessary.

It should be kept in nind that the outlay of chemical antifoan in hydrolytic
yeast production depends not only on the physico-chenical characteristics of
the sntifoaa, but also on the lethod of addition, the physico-chelical
characteristics of the frothing nediun, the strain of yeast, the physiological
condition of the calls, etc. These indices are different in every plant,
therefore the outlay of antifoeln per ton of yeast is not uniform in the
hydrolysis enterprises.

For cospnrison, Table 1 presents data on outlays of chemical antifoaa in
1974 for each plant in the hydrolysis industry. The data presented in
Table 1 show that the outlay of chenical antifossn fluctuates from 5-38 kg
per alcohol plant and from 115 to 77 kg per nonalcohol plant. This causes
differing expenditures per ton of yeast of R 5-35.

Because of curtail-ant of supply stocks of cod liver oil for the needs of
the hydrolysis industry, the authors of the present article conducted a
study on selecting and finding new types of chemical antifoals which can
be used for production of fodder yeast.

In order to investigate the autumn properties of a number of new chenical
substances, water emulsions of then in different concentrations of the basic
substanceus-lO-lS-ZOI—were prepared in the laboratory in s nixer. The
time of enulsificstion was 5 nin, the frequency of nixer rotation was 5000
rev/Din. The caulsion obtained reduced yeast foals taken from the first
section of the production floatstors of the Leningrad Hydrolysis Plant.

After the focus was reduced, the value of the yeast suspension and the amount
of yeast in it were determined.

Qualitative indicators--dispcrsion and stability--were chosen in order to
evaluate the whim: obtained. Dispersion was determined visually, and
stability was expressed by the relation:

The results of the laboratory eotperinents are presented in Table 2.

As can be seen from Table 2, of the nearly no different chemical substances
tested, the most effective were technical oleic acid, fatty acids of tall
oils, soap stocks from vegetable oils, synthetic fatty acids and alcohols.
They reduce foam with sufficient speeduin 30 to 80 s--with a relatively
small outlay of 12-20 g of antifoam per kg of absolute dry yeast. The
stability of the emlsion which was determined by methodology described in
the literature (2), is as high as 75-981.

it should be noted that all these substances have compatively low surface
tension, a long hydrocarbon radical chain, and a hydrophilic group. Conse-

quently, the conclusions (1) are, to an extent, valid for selection of
antifoams for hydrolytic media.

The substances which showed high foam-reducing properties in laboratory
investigations were tested under industrial conditions in the Leningrad
plant which processes spent beer with yeast. Hater emulsions of these
substances were prepared in a plant unit with aid of a vortical pump. The
conditions under which the emulsion was prepared and the results of indus-
trial testing are presented in Table 3.

Testing demonstrated that the most effective antifoams were soap stocks
from vegetable oils and fatty acids of tall oils. These substances are
inexpensive (ll 300-600/ton) and they give a stable water emulsion under
industrial conditions.

Although synthetic fatty acids and alcohols have foam-reducing properties.
they have an unpleasant, asphyxiating odor; therefore With the existing
technology it is impossible to use them for fodder yeast culture.

Organic silicon compounds proved to be ineffective as chemical antifoams
in continuous process cultures.

Conc lusions

1. Studies on the selection of new types of chemical antifoams for
hydrolytic yeast production were conducted. Approximately loo types of
sybstnnces of different origins were tested.

2. The most promising were soap stocks from vegetable oils, fatty acids
of tall oils COST 14845-69, types A, B, or V, and technical oleic acids
obtained from hide fat.

3. It appears that in selecting chemical antifoams for growing fodder
protein yeast, it is necessary to focus on substances having sufficiently
long hydrocarbon chains and having hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups.

[Tut] Nutrient salt solutions for yeast production are usually prepared
by dissolving dry salts in water. In accordance with planning decisions,
such a nethod was also used in the hydrolysis yeast plant in the town of
Razlog. As e result oi dissolving salts in industrial water, the lean

concentration of phosphorus counted per P205 in the solutions was only 1.5
P¢rccnto

In order to demonstrate the possibility of increasing the phosphorus
concentration of solutions in our plant, starting in 1965, the process of
dissolving nutrient seltensuperphosphete and potassium chloride-oin
recirculated yeast rashes using the approach of experilental planning was
investigated. The positive results of the investigations iqelled us to

conduct industrial tests of the nethod; the u-Iarired results are presented
in the present article.

The industrial tests were conducted in the Rarlog hydrolysis yeest plant
in accordance with a detailed technological diagran uhich is presented
in the figure. In order to conduct the tests, from the total nunber of
observations 301 were selected at an interval of 86.64038, representing
the sea arithetic values of the results obtained at an inteval of
86.410 . The total duration of testing was 2.584055. Analyses were
done using the standard nethodology. The volune of yeast lash 9"
deterrdned by "all of a float gage and by colputation. The results were
statistically analyzed using Student's t-test.

The characteristics of the nutrient salts and the yeast lash during the
test period are presented in Tables I and 2, respectively.

1110 operating conditions of the industrial apparatus for preparing nutrient

the test period the mean concentration of phosphorus counted per P205 was
1.8 percent. Its increase to 21.33 percent in comparison with the existing
aethod is caused by the increased temperature of the process (30.15 K), the
active acidity (pH-6.1) of the yeast trash and the optimal conditions for
obtaining nutrient salt solutions. In the solutions obtained, the average
content (kg/n3) of nitrogen was 9.63; of PB, 1.10; of potassium chloride,
10.39. The comparatively large reliable interval for individual observation
of the phosphorus concentration (counted per P205) is caused by the varia-
bility of its superphosphate content and disturbance of the technological
conditions.

As a result of introducing a method for obtaining nutrient salt solutions
by recirculating yeast meshes, it was determined that the effectiveness of
fodder yeast production increases therewith. Thus, in manufacturing 11,500
tons of yeast, 332,900 tons of superphosphetee (with a “7. P205 content),
98.1.16 tons of amoniac water (257. N113), 2.09 tons of potassium chloride
(627. K20), 600 tons of steam and significant amounts of electric energy

and capital expenditures were saved. In addition, ”Ks contamination of
sewage decreased. The economic effect obtained in this case was 8,000 Levs.

Conclusions

1. Industrial tests of a method for obtaining solutions of the nutrient

salts superphosphete and potassium chloride using yeast meshes did not
present any difficulty.

2. It was denonstrated that yeast mash accelerates the process of salt
solution. The concentration of phosphorus counted per R205 in the solution
increases by 21.33 percent in comparison with the existing method.

3. As the result of applying the method, savings are achieved in super-
phosphate, amoniac water, potassium chloride, steam, electric energy and
capital expenditures; ”Ks contamination of sewage decreases.

lo. The method developed can be used in modernizing and reconstructing
existing enterprises and in planning new plants for producing fodder yeast
from hydrolysates of forestry and agricultural wastes.

MODERN METHODS FOR CREATING ULTRACLBAN PREMISES

Moscow KHIHIKO-FARHATSEVTICRBSKIY ZHURNAL in Russian No 2. 1979 pp 89-95

[Article by c.-r. Khortig. babcock-nShKh Company, Federal Republic of
Germany]

[Text] Increasing importance is being attributed to creating aseptic or
ultraclean working conditions in the most diverse areas of scientific
research and industry. In the pharmaceutical industry. with the develop-
ment of new injectebles that cannot be subsequently sterilized, the
production of such products under ultraclean conditions acquires special
importance. The goal of working under absolutely sterile conditions,
free of all foreign particles, is an ideal that can only be more or less
approached in practice.

A distinction is often made between pollution by dust particles and micro-
organisms. Of course, these are two very different types of pollution;
however, experience in working in the field of methods for ultraclean
premises shows that both these forms of pollution should be taken into
consideration simultaneously, since there is no method as yet for removing,
for example, only biologically active particles from air, whereas the exist-
ing modern methods of filtering air permit trapping both types of pollutants
simultaneously (by means of modern instruments. the concentration of all
particles in air in a suspended state is measured within 1 min and. at the
some time, determination is made of their distribution according to site).

The main objective of modern engineering for the creation of ultraclean
premises is to trap. along with all suspended particles in air, the
elements of nicrobial contamination. Thus far, it has not been possible

to determine precisely the proportion between biologically active particles
and inert ones that are transported in air. Very approximately, the

ratio can be considered to constitute 1:1000.

Figure 1 illustrates the usually encountered concentrations of particles in
air. The y-axis shows the numbar of particles that are larger than the

site of the arbitrary unit. Let us consider, for example. particles that are
0.5 pm in size; we see that there are 100,000 to 1,000,000 such particles
per liter air in a large city; premises with higher air purity requirements,

18

FOR OFFICIAL USB ONLY

equipped with an ordinary ventilation system, contain about 1000 such par-
ticles per liter air. while those equipped with a system operating on the
principle of laminar flow of air have up to one such particle per liter
air. This figures demonstrate convincingly that the use of modern methods
for creating ultraclean premises air purity can be improved by 1000 times.

2) clean premises with ordinary

3) laminar flow throughout
4) laminar flow in a localized area

In order to answer the question of
why the air purity indices are so
low in premises with ordinary
ventilation we should consider the
sources of air pollution. Han
himself is the primary source of
air pollution indoors. Table 1
lists the indicen of particles
emitted by man into the environment
as related to the nature of his
movements. The scale covers indicea
of 100,000 to 30,000,000 particles
per minute. Let us consider what
happens to air in a too. equipped
with ordinary ventilation when there
are 1 to 10,000,000 particles
(Figure 2). Purified air enters

the room at a high speed through
hoods or grating [louvers) that are
located in the ceiling in most cases.
Because of this and jet pumping. a
highly turbulent flow is generated
in the room, which blows through
all tones and corners, after which
the air is removed from the room
through outlets located near the
floor. Usually air is exchanged

10 to 20 times per hour. Let us
estimate the number of suspended
particles in the room. Let us assume
that the area of the room is 10 m2,
its height is 3 a, air is exchanged
10 times an hour and that a man is
working in the room who emits about
5010‘ particles over 0.5 pm in site
per min. or 300x10‘lh. The volume

01 air removed from the room constituting lOXJO, i.e.. 300 m’lh, even on
the assumption that the delivered air contains 0 particles, we shall find
that the concentration of particles in room air would constitute 1000 par-
ticles per liter air or, when scaled arbitrarily to microbial contamination.

l microorganism per liter air.

This estimate cleerly shows that the usual systems of air purification have
very limited effectiveness. The chief flaw of such systems is that the
air in the room is constantly mixed with freshly supplied air. and instead
of removal of particles and microorganisms there is merely dilution thereof
in the fresh incoming air. Consequently, usual air purification systems
serve only as a barrier to exogenous pollution. but they do not prevent
pollution arising in the room in the course of human activity.

Before we discuss more refined methods of room air purification. we should
summarize the most typical cases of pollution. This can be done by
defining the lirection of movement of pollutants (Figure 3). The work zone
or product itself are arbitrarily depicted in this figure in the form of

a table (1). while the worker in the environment is rendered as a human

figure. In case a(2). the possibility of contamination of the product (or
work tone) from the environ-ant should be ruled out. The arrow points to
the direction of movesent of pollutants that have to be averted. In other
words. we are dealing here with a case of protection of the work tone that
has high air purity requirements from external pollution. There are also
the opposite situations, for example. in manufacturing drugs for intake

by mouth. when it is not the product that has to be protected from the
environment. but the environment from the product. In (3), the arrow
points to movement of pollutants in the opposite direction for such a case.

In addition, it is necessary quite often, particularly when conducting
pharmacological or microbiological tests. to prevent pollution in both
directions. case 2 (4).

These three cases (3,‘§ and 3) cover virtually all situations that are en-
countered. Let us use d to designate all special cases that are not
covered bya _, b and c. The same situations as in cases a. h and.5 apply to
cases d, but when there are additional special conditions: for example,

the use of protective gases or extreme temperatures.

Let us discuss each specific case. the methods available for each of them
and the results that can be achieved.

As we have already stated. we must concentrate on processes of movement of
air flows. The main flaw of existing traditional systems is that the
incoming fresh air is mixed with the air circulating in the room.

In order to control the movement of suspended particles in air. the air
flow itself must be controlled. Instead of a turbulent, constantly mixing

21
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

flow of ai., we have to create precisely directed, uniform movement of the
air flow, free of turbulence, as much as possible. In this case, the room
is transformed into a distinctive flow-through channel.

Such uniform, slow, vortex-free flows of air resemble laminar, i.e., jet
flow, in hydrodynamic processes. Hence thename of "laminar course," or
"laminar flow." At present we already know that we are not dealing with
true laminar flow in the strict sense, but only with the initial elements
of this process with high value of Reynolds' number. More precisely, the
flow is not vortex-free but with minimal turbulence, i.e., we observe on
the sides of the flow slow and very mild displacement (mixing) of air par-

ticles. Figure 4 illustrates this phenomenon clearly; it was submitted to
comprehensive investigation when defining its patterns.

Figure 4.
Transport of substance
in flow section behind

0n the basis of these data, we can calculate the required size of a device
and define the zones that must be protected from pollution (Figure 5).
Figure 5 is a sketch of a dispensing machine that operates in a vertical
flow of air. It is shown that the farther it is from the work zone, the
larger the area of flow around must be.

Moreover, experience has shown that the smaller the work zone, the better
the results of purification. This phenomenon can be easily explained,

22
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

since the smaller the channel through which flow passes. the easier it is
for air to bypass the obstacle. Consider a production line in a pharma-
ceutical enterprise. The highest purity requirements apply to a relatively
circumscribed work zone. On this basis. one can conclude that the most

refined purification of air should be provided primarily in these zones.
and this can be accomplished with zonal devices.

Thus. the problems referable to

I case a can be solved by creating

I special "laminar flow" equipusent

in the fore of work tables or

booths. The problees referable

' to case b are resolved by using
so-cslled "reverse laminar flow."

Unlike case a, a direct flow of

air with Iinimal turbulence is ob-
,” I tained by scans of an exhaust or
h,_ . suction (Figure 6). The exhaust

In conclusion. let us return to the question of classifying premises with
increased air purity requiresents. The concentration of foreign particles
and alcroorganlan in room air is only one of the factors of probability of

pollution. The tine factor and size of exposed area are equally important.
To deter-nine the general probability of pollution. one must use an index
that is the product of all factors together for oach stage i of the pro-
duction process. This derivative index I for a specific stage i of the
production process is expressed as It - Pvtrl'lv. where P; is the concentra-

having thus obtained the derivative index for each stage of the production
process. we can readily detarsine which tone or which place is subject to

the greatest danger of pollution and where special precautionary steps should
be taken. For the entire production process as a whole. the index of

probability of pollution ﬂ is derived so the sun of indicss for each stage
of the production process. i.e..

Table 2 lists the stages of the process of prodcution of s drug at a phar-
maceutical enterprise. The first column lists the different stages of the
process. the second. the ties the product spends at each stage: the third.

the indices of probability of pollution at each stage. At the top are

indieea obtained when the equipment wss protected by ordinary ventilation
devices and at the bottoe. indices obtained after conversion to a purifica-
tion system operating on the lssinsr flow principle.

As can be seen from the listed indices. the probability of pollution is not
the sane at each separate stage of the production process; for exasple.

in the work zone where the vials are sealed. the danger of pollution is
relatively sinor. in spite of the high concentration of particles. due to
the brief time the product spends in this zone.

If we cnspsre the top and bottoa indices. we shall see that the button
ones are sore than 10,000 tines better!

Table 2 shows that the probles of preventing contamination can be resolved
by means of eetheds for providing ultrsclean premises. based on the
principle of lasinsr flow of air.

[Text] Studies of the functional state of the adrenohypophyaeol system
as related to exposure of the body to different factors make it possible
to assess the activity of nonspecific defense and adaptation reactions
under different conditions. He previously demonstrated that exposure to
continuous helium-neon lasers with beam output of a, 25 and 60 IN induces
a relatiVely brief stressor effect in rats only when the eyes are exposed
to the bean (Nikitina. Maslakov, 1977).

It is interesting to test the effect of exposing rats to pulsed lasers on
blood corticosteroid content.

Material and Methods

He used a neodyoium laser at a wavelength of [.06 um and ruby laser at a
wavelength of 0.69 no in our experiaents.

The animals (male rats) were rigidly immobilized during the experiment.

To test the reaction to lasers, the rats were divided into groups, the

blood being taken (decapitation) at different postexposure times: 5. l5, 30.
60. 120 min, 24 and 48 h. Concurrently with experimental. irradiated animals,
we also examined control rats, which were also immobilized and shielded

from the beam. we tested the effects of a beam directed to different parts
of the body: eyes. parietal region of the skull. region of the gonads and
adrenals.

in the experiments involving exposure of the eyes to pulsed neodymium lasers.
we used beans varying in energy density (from 6 to 1000 J/cn ). the area of
the light spot constituting 0. 03-0. 07 en’ . in those involving exposure of
the skull. regions of the gonads and adrenals, we first shaved off the fur

In the regions to be exposed. we repeated the ease procedure on the control
animals.

The parietal region of the skull was exposed to a neodymium laser beam with
energy densities of 10 and 600 chm2 , aimed at the hypothalamic region. The
gonads were exposed to a neodymium laser beam at energy densities of 1000 and
1500 J/cmz . the area of the light spot constituting about 0.008 cm . For
exposure of the adrenal region, the beam was aimed at the angle formed by

the last rib and long muscle of the back. In these experiments we used nee-
dymium lasers (beam energy density 38 J/cm’ . at the rate of 5 pulses, and
300 J/cm’ . 1 pulse per adrenal) and ruby lasers (energy density 25 J/cm ,

3 pulses to the region of each adrenal). In these experiments, the area of
the light spot was 0. 2—0. 5 cs .

To examine the functional state of the adrenals. we assayed blood plasma cor-
ticosteroid content in experimental and control animals by the method of
competitive protein-binding analysis using h-cortiaol-l, 2 and rat serum
transcortin as binding protein (Volchek. 1973).

He first tested the characteristics of different types of stress on the basis

of glucocoritoid content of experimental animals' blood (Volchek at el., 1976;
Hukhsmmedov. Nikitins et al., 1976).

The experimental results were submitted to statistical processing (nayley.
1962).

Results and Discussion

Effect of beam aimed at the eyes: he deviations from normal. in
either behavior or condition of the eyes. was observed with the use of a
beam with energy density of 6 and 30 J/cm (1-3 pulses). With the use of s
200 J/cm2 been. we demonstrated a deleterious effect on eye tissues. The
animal twitched and squeahed when the laser unit was turned on. One could
detect almost immediately the formation of a white spot deep in the eye.
Single exposure to a beam of pulsed neodymium laser did not induce signifi-
cant changes in corticosteroid content for 2 days (as compared to the
control) (Figure 1).

A deep white spot appeared in the rat eye after exposure to neodymium lasers
at energy density of 266 and 1000 J/cmz (once a day for 3 days). as was found
after single exposure. Some animals presented bleeding from the eye and
impairment of its fibrous tunic after the first exposure to a 1000 J/cmz
beam. Hith repeated exposure, the leukoma grew larger in site; the eyelids
stuck together in some rats. 0n the bth experimental day (2b h after the

3d exposure), most rats presented hyperemia on the internal side of the
laukoma, which was a sign of development of an inflammatory process. Never-
theless, the irradiated animals appeared normal throughout the experiment.
and their behavior differed little from that of control rats.

He failed to demonstrate appreciable differences between irradiated and
control rats with respect to blood corticosteroid content (Figure 2).

Thus. under the conditions we used. single and aultiple exposure of the

rat eyes to pulsed neodymium lasers did not have a significant streasor
effect, as compared to the stress of rigid immobilization.

A comparison of the results of these experiments to information obtained
previously warrants the belief that the factor of duration of exposure is
more important to development of stress than the factor of intensity of

radiation. Moreover. the obtained results suggest that the nociceptive
reactions of the rats are attenuated.

Effect of beam aimed at the skull: Since the hypothalamus is the
highest elemsnt in regulation of the hypothalamus-hypophyais-adrenala system,
it was interesting to examine the effects of a laser been aimed at the
parietal region of the skull and focused on the region of this gland. Hacro-
acopic examination of tissues in the exposed region (beam energy density

600 J/cm') revealed a skin burn and minor necrosis in cranial muscles. Bones.
meninges and the brain failed to present visible changes. Apparently. the
external tissues (skin, muscles) absorb a significant part of the radiant
energy. There were no substantial deviations in corticosteroid content in

experimental animals throughout the experiment (as compared to the control)
(Figure 3).

Thus, single exposure of the rat's parietal region to a neodymium laser

compared to rigid i-nobiliration.

Effect of been aimed at the gonadal region: we selected this organ
for Investigation in view of the fact that. in the first place, it is not
vithin the body. in the second place. there is a close relationship between
the function of the hypophyseogonadel end hypophyseo-edrenal systems and.
in the third place. this organ and adjacent tissues have high sensitivity to
pain. It was also interesting to conpare the effect of exposing rats to
neodymium lasers aimed at the testicular region and the mechanical effect

of pricking the skin of the scrotum with a needle on blood corticosteroid
content.

The rat squeaked at the time of exposure to the laser beam. Snell areas of
necrosis appeared on the external and internal sides of the skin. Bffusion of
blood in the external tunic of the testes was observed in some animals in

the experiment with a 1500 Jlomz beam. Visually, no changes in tissue of the
gonad proper were demonstrable in any of the experiments.

He used a preparation needle. about 1 III in diameter. to puncture the rats.
The anterior surface of the scrotum was pulled away so that the needle would
not touch the testes. The prick was administered as briefly as possible. to
correspond to the duration of the laser pulse used.

revealed a reliable difference only 30 min after exposure to a 1500 J/cmz beam

Effect of been aimed at the adrenal region: we previously denoa-
strated that exposure of the region of the adrenals. one of the Iain ele-
aents in the etressor mechanism. to continuous action helium-neon laser bean
did not induce significant differences between experimental and control
animals. with respect to blood corticosteroid content (Nikitina, Haslakow.
1977). Minor aecrobiotic changes in the external surface of the skin were
observed in rats exposed to pulsed lasers. at the site of exposure. The
other tissues. including the adrenals. remained intact. In this series of
experiments. the corticosteroid content of blood of experimental animals did
not differ froa that of control rats (Table 2). Evidently. the lack of a
direct effect of the laser been on the adrenals is attributable to absorption
of nest of the energy by the skin and auaclea.

[Text] This conference, which convened in Khar'kov on 18-19 May 1978,

was organised by the USSR and Ukrainian ministries of health. the All-Union
and Ukrainian scientific societies of neuropathologists and psychiatrists.
the Central Scientific Research Institute of Forensic Psychiatry iaeni

Prof V. P. Serbskiy. the Khar'kov Scientific Research Institute of Neurology
and Psychiatry. as well as the Ukrainian Institute for Advanced Training of
Physicians. 6. V. MOROZOV, chairman of the board of the All-Union Scientific
Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists. delivered the opening reaarks
at the conference. He stressed the need to create a broad network of psycho-
therapeutic care, to expand the training of psychotherapists. as well as

to work on theoretical problems of psychotherapy.

E. A. BASAYAN (Hoscow) delivered one of the main papers at the conference,
dealing with the role of psychotherapeutic care in the structure of the
addiction service. with analysis and specific suggestions to augaent the
role of psychotherapy in the treat-ant of patients suffering from alcoholism
on different levels of the addiccion [”narcological") service.

The papers of M. S. LBBEDINSKIY (Moscow). V. YE. ROZHUOV (Moscow). H. H.
KABANOV (Leningrad) and b. D. KARVASARSKIY (Leningrad) discussed various
aspects of theoretical probleaa of psychotherapy. Organization of psychiatric
care was the topic of the papers of I. Z. VEL'VOVSKIY (Kher’kov) and N. K.
LIPGART (Khargkov). A. T. FILATOV (Khar'kov) discussed in his paper

questions of correlation between psychotherapy, psychohygiene and psycho-
prophylaxis [preventive psychiatry].

Pour section aeetings dealt with psychotherapy in the treataent of soaatic
diseases. borderline states. alcoholisa and drug addiction. as well as in
psychiatric practice. Surveys prepared by nesting chair-en on the basis of
published data served as the basis for discussion of relevant probleas.
Thus. at the aeeting entitled "Psychotherapy in the Treat-ant of Somatic
Diseases." the survey paper of V. V. KOVALEV (Moscow) suanarised the data

information of 22 reports, which delonstrated convincingly the need to

use psychotherapy in the presence of various somatic diseases. in particular,
ccrebrovascular diseases. myocardial infarction. bronchial asthma, pathology
of the gastrointestinal tract, endocrine diseases, etc. V. V. Kovalev dwelled
in particular on a group of papers dealing with psychotherapy in bslneology.
At the meeting entitled "Psychotherapy of Iorderline States," N. H. ASATIANI
(Moscow) delivered a survey paper summarizing the data in 30 reports. he
analysed different aspects and methods of psychotherapy in cases of functional
neurotic pathology and discussed interaction between psychotehrapy and psycho-
pharmacology. I. V. STRBL'CHUK (Moscow) delivered a paper summarizing the
data in 13 reports at the meeting on "Psychotherapy for Alcoholism and Drug
Addiction." and demonstrated the role of pcychotharapy at different stages

of treatment of alcoholics. the participants in the discussions stressed

the special importance of group psychotherapy in the treatsent of alcoholism,
which is directed toward altering the personality sets of the patients. At
the section meeting entitled "Paychetherapy in Paychiatric Practice,” the
survey paper of H. H. KABANOV (Leningrad) systematized the data from 15
reports. A special place was given to reports indicating the importance and
potential of developing group forms of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice.
There were animated discussions at all of the above meetings, which de-
veioped and defined a number of theses pertaining to practical and organi-
zational problems of psychotherapeutic care.

SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRISTS
Moscow ZHURNAL NEVRDPATOLOCII I PSIKHIATRII in Russian No 3, 1979 p 377

[Article by H. A. Hadvedev, A. l. Potapov, Ye. D. Krasik and H. I. Petrov
(Tomsk)]

[Text] There is an age-old tradition in Tomak, a tradition that consists

of close collaboration between the chair of psychiatry (headed by Prof Ye. D.
Krasik) and the Oblaat Psychiatric Hospital (chief physician H. I. Petrov;
A. I. Potapov prior to 1975), Which serves as the base of operations for the
chair.

At the present time, they are functionally united for the purpose of further
expansion of scientific research on pressing problems of psychiatry, upgrading
the quality of differentiated psychiatric care of the inhabitants of Tomskaya
Oblast and improving educational and methodological work. A special statute
was prepared and approved for this scientific and clinical association. The
following are considered its main objectives: 1) expansion of scientific
research on the problem of epidemiology, symptomatology and rehabilitation

of mental patients; 2) improvement of diagnostic work, develop-ant, trial and
immediate introduction to psychiatric practice of new, scientifically sub-
stantiated clinical, paraclinical and sociopsychological methods of patient
examination; 3) expansion of highly qualified consultant services for patients
in hospitals and under extramural conditions; A) systematic advancement of
qualifications of physicians, interns, nurses, junior medical personnel,
vocational instructors, psychologists and social workers; 5) improvement of
specialized care of patients suffering from chronic alcoholism and drug
addiction, as well as expansion of in-depth scientific research in this
field; 6) expansion of studies, faster trial and adoption in psychiatric
practice of new ways and means of early detection and dispensary care of
patients; 7) preparation of new, more effective rehabilitation programs,
clinical substantiation thereof, rapid trial and introduction to psychiatric
practice; 8) continued improvement of management aspects of hospital and
extramural care of the public, improved continuity of all stages of rehabili-
tntion; 9) expansion of sociohygienic research on the problem of controlling
drunkenness and alcoholism on the basis of business contracts with industrial
enterprises. the Tomsk ASU [automatic control system] and a number of insti-
tutes; 10) improvement of educational and methodological work, differentiated

according to faculties. bring Instruction closer to the demands of prac-
tical public health care; ll) development of new forms of student participa-
tion in research pursued by the scientific and clinical association: 12) im-
provement and expansion of dissemination of medical, sanitary and hygienic
information in different rayons of this oblast and at industrial enter-
prises of Touch.

This association does not. therefore. cancel the tasks facing the hospital
and chair; rather. it raises them to a new level. providing conditions for
more immediate and effective development of neuropsychlatric care for the
residents of the oblaat. upgrading the quality of scientific. educational
and therapeutic work. as well as personnel training. By order of the

hand of the Oblast health Department and rector of the medical institute.
an association council was formed to administer the scientific and practical
[clinical] association. This council includes the chief physician of the
hospital. his deputies. 2-3 department heads. the head of the paraclinical
service, head of the chair of psychiatry of the medical institute, a
decent (assistant), representatives of public organizations of the chair
and hospital. The same order includes the appointment of a scientific
administrator for the association. The council meets at least once every

2 months in accordance with a specially prepared nlan. Its decisions

are considered compulsory for all staff members of the hospital and chair.
The hospital is accountable about its operation to the Oblas: llealth
Dcpartaent and association council, while the chair is accountable to the
rector of the medical institute and also the association council. 0n the
whole. the scientific and clinical association is accountable to the joint
meeting of the rectorate of the medical institute and board of the Oblast
Health Department. In spite of some debatable aspects of the statute con-
cerning the scientific and clinical association. which must be resolved,
even now it is apparent that organisational integration of the work of
scientists and practicing physicians is quite effective. This is shown

by the fact that the scientific and clinical association of Tonak psychia-
trists has become a school of advanced knowhow: a regularly operating
All-Union seminar on rehabilitation of mental patients was organized on
the basis of the hospital and chair.

The CPSU's consistent policy of creating healthful and comfortable living
conditiOns in cities and settlements. protecting the environment from

pollution. making rational use of resources and of efficiency and

increased work quality is promoted by such basic goals of sanitary cleaning

and waste disposal in cities and settlements as ensuring highly sanitary
conditions in residential areas. streets. squares and areas of green plantations.
complete treatment and utilization of wastes in the national economy.

complex mechanization of waste collection. removal. treatment and processing

and of waste disposal in urban areas. decreasing the cost of waste collection.

removal. treatment and processing operations and of cleaning operations
in urban areas.

The wide program of social development. the constant increase in the soviet
people's standard of living. the increase in the use of products and industrial
goods and the increase in the urban population all cause rapid growth in

the amounts of waste and lead to an annual increase in the volume of urban

sanitary cleaning work. In recent years. progress has been aade in organizing
the sanitary cleaning of cities and settlements: a planned. regular system

of waste collection and removal has been introduced; the amount of manual
labor has been sharply reduced; the material and technical base of the
sanitation enterprises has increased. and a great deal of work has been
done in equipping and organising landfills for solid residential wastes.
Large rubbish treatment plants have been put into operation.

Further planning and construction of plants for the biological and thermal
treatment of wastes from which it vauld be possible to obtain and use in
the national econoay heat. electrical energy. compost. organic fuels.
metals. etc.. are urgently needed. Such plants are being built in Hoscow.
Vladivostok. Khar'kov. Odessa. Tol‘yatti. Rovno. Zhitomir and other cities.

In order to use effectively the enormous funds allocated for developing

and perfecting sanitary cleaning--a branch of municipal service which is
technically and organizationally one of the most complex—-it is necessary
to use a scientifically-based approach in selecting types of plants,
machines and mechanisms and technological schemes for sanitary cleaning and

in predicting changes in the composition. properties and accumulation of
wastes.

In preparing the present handbook. we used normative materials. instructions.
recommendations and studies from the K. D. Pamfilov Academy of Municipal
Service. literary materials and the experience of the sanitary cleaning
organizations of the cities of the Ukrainian SSR. In connection with the
development and division into independent branches of individual branches

of municipal service bewerage. gas-scrubbing. protection against noise and
vibration. etc.). data on these subjects are not presented in this book.

The foreword and chapters 1. 3 and b were written by P. D. Dmitrenko,

chapter 2 by P. D. Dmitrenko and Yu. L. Shevchenko, chapters 5 and 7 by
Yu. L. Shevchenko.
