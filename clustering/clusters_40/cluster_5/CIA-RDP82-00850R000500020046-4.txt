llntroduction:]

The ancient lands of the Ukraine. scorched by fierce wars. lie on both sides of the
Dnepr-Slavutich in the southwestern part of the Soviet Union. Sons of the Ukraine
steadfastly defended their land for many centuries against forays by foreign
invaders. The Ukrainian people's struggle against oppressors and for national
independence became more decisive and successful following their reunificatvon with

the Great Russian people. The 325th anniversary of this historic event is being
celebrated this year.

The union of fraternal peoples was filled with new content and becsne one of the
decisive factors in the struggle for reorganizing society on a socialist basis with
the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution. when the workers overthrew
the exploiting classes and took power into their own hands.

Led by the Party of Lenin. the fraternal peoples acted as a single front against
the interventionists and internal counterrevolution. which raised their hands to
the historic achievements of the working class and peasantry. From October 1917
through March 1919 fierce class battles took place in the Ukraine against the
bourgeois-nationalist Central Rada. German occupiers. the hetmanste and the Pet-
lyura Directory. At that time there was a process of development and consolidation

of Soviet power in the Ukraine. and a regular Red Army was formed.

The Kiev Military District was organized in March 1919 in the central part of the
Ukraine on the basis of local entities of military control. This was one of the
important activities of the Communist Party, which under Vladimir Il'ich Lenin's
leadership was conducting an organizational development of the armed forces of the
young proletarian state.

Prominent party, state and military figures took an active part in the struggle for
the power of the soviets. in the creation and strengthening of armed forces in the
Ukraine, in formation of the Kiev Military District and in troop management.

Prominent military leaders worked in the district in different years: I. Kh. Bagra-
myan,V. K. Blyukher, N. P. Vatutin. A. A. Grechko, A. I. Yegorov. 6. K. Zhukov, M.
P. Kirponos. P. K. Koshevoy. V. G. Kulikov. K. S. Moskalenko. K. K. Rokossovskiy.
S. K. Timoshenko, I. P. Ped'ko. V. I. Chuykov. I. B. Yakir and I. I. Yakubovskiy.

The district was a border district for a long while, and this placed an imprint on
the troops' life and combat training. Commanders. fighting men. political entities
and staffs struggled persistently to increase combat readiness and master new
models of combat equipment. Many test exercises with the participation of large
masses of troops were conducted in the district in prswar years. The combat train—
ing. which took place in a situation approximating actual conditions of combat
actions to the maximum. was a good school for development and maturity of fighting
men. commanders and political workers.

The district officer corps demonstrated boundless devotion to their people. the
Communist Party and the Soviet government. and mature military proficiency in the
stern tests of the Civil and Great Patriotic wars. Rank-and-file soldiers and the
NCO's fought the hated enemies courageously. The names of many true sons of the
multinational Soviet people who performed exploits on the soil of the Ukraine. now
a quadruple-order Soviet Socialist Republic famed for its industrial might. well
developed agriculture and outstanding successes in science and technology. have
become legendary. Labor victories of Ukrainian workers became possible thanks to
the wise Leninist policy of nationalities. which united the peoples into a single
powerful Soviet Union. "The unity of the multinational Soviet people." said CPSU
CC General Secretary. Chairman of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet L. I.
Brezhnev. "is as strong as diamonds. And as the diamond hasan iridescent facet. so
the unity of our people sparkles with the diversity of its component nations. each
of which lives a rich. full-fledged. free and happy life."‘

The grateful memory of the Ukrainian people sscredly preserves the names and heroic
deeds of the defenders of the socialist homeland. Cities and villages of the
Ukraine have set up more than 2.000 museums where exhibits and documents have been
Cullectcd about the exploits of Soviet soldiers. Memorials have been erected and
monuments and obelisks set up in honor of their utter dedication to the Motherland
and their courage.

A feature of the district is the fact that over 20 military educational institu—
tions of varying profiles are located here. Military schools. other schools and

courses have prepared tens of thousands of officers for the Soviet Army who are spe-
cialists in their work. capable indoctrinators and strong-willed commanders. Among

those who began their combat career here were army generals N. F. Vatutin and I. D.
Chernyakhovskiy. marshals artillery Yu. P. Dashanov and G. F. Odintsov. generals A.
Ye. Borovykh. A. c. Kravchanko. V. D. Kryuchenkin. V. D. Lavrinenkov. I. V. Pen-
filov. P. C. Shafranov and many others.

District troops and military educational institutions and the collectives of mili-
tary enterprises and establishments. which are an organic component of the USSR
Armed Forces. take an active part in all major events involving the strengthening
of national defensive might. The privates. uco'a. officers and generals of all
generations. brought up by the Communist Party. serve their people and the great
cause of communism selflessly.

In the postwar years as before. the Kiev Military District was the initiator of
many famous patriotic undertakings which contributed to a comprehensive strengthen—
ing of the Armed Forces' might and the defensive capability of the Soviet state.
Ita troops participated in major exercises and maneuvers. The more advanced models
of combat equipment and weapons were tested here and new theoretical propositions
of tactics and operational art were checked in practice. All this served for the
further development of military affairs.

The Soviet Motherland appraised the military efforts of personnel highly. The Kiev
District. many of its combined units and units. and military educational institu-
tions were awarded orders. memorial banners. and jubilee Lenin honor scrolls. Grand
revolutionary and combat traditions of heroes of the Great October and of the Civil
and Great Patriotic wars live and multiply among the troops.

Historic resolutions of the 25th CPSU Congress. adoption of the new USSR Constitu-
tion and celebrations in connection with the 60th anniversary of the Great October
Socialist Revolution and our valorous Armed Forces generated a new surge of energy
in district personnel. The Motherland's defenders are steadfastly mastering combat
proficiency. they are strengthening military discipline and efficiency daily. and
they are secredly implementing Lenin's behests and the Communist Party's demands
for a further comprehensive increase in the defensive capability of the land of

developed socialism. and an increase in combat readiness of units and combined
units.

Rallied closely about the Leninist Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet
government. district personnel are ready to perform their patriotic and interna-
tional duty with honor at any minute.

This book tells about the establishment. development and activities of the Red
Banner Kiev Military District. It was written by a group of authors on the basis
of archive materials. official documents of the USSR Ministry of Defense and of
party entities. military-scientific literature and memoirs.

The editorial board and group of authors were given great assistance in working on
the book by the Agitprop Directorate of the Main Political Directorate of the
Soviet Army and Navy. the Military Science Directorate of the USSR Armed Forces
General Staff. the Military Science Department of the Main Staff of the Ground
Forces. Main Personnel Directorate of the USSR Ministry of Defense. the Institute

Chapter Seventeen: Always in Combat Readiness
Indissoluble Ties

The past decade in the district's history is characterized by a further consolida—
tion of ties between the people and the Army. Military personnel take part in
congresses of the CP of the Ukraine and the Komsomol and in the work of party,
Komsomol and soviet entities. They are elected to the cc CP of the Ukraine. to the
Republic Supreme Soviet. and to local soviets of people's deputies.

The Communist Party and government of the Ukraine devote constant attention to the
development of businesslike. creative ties between the workers and military units.
They delve into the life and combat training of the personnel and give necessary
assistance in increasing combat readiness. improving material and living conditions
and organizing political indoctrination work. In early May 1977 leaders of the
Ukrainian Communist Party and government comrades V. V. Shcherbitskiy. N. M.
Borisenko. A. P. Botvin. A. P. Vatchenko. G. I. Vashchenko, A. P. Lyashko. I. Z.
Sokolov. V. A. Sologub. V. V. Fedorchuk. V. Ye. Malanchuk. Ya. P. Pogrebnyak and
others visited Unit "X." They were accompanied by Col Gen I. A. Gerasimov,
commander of the Red Banner Kiev Military District. and Lt Gen V. T. Dement'yev.
member of the military council and chief of political directorate. Residents of
the military post greeted the deer guests cordially. The unit commander reported
the status of combat readiness. He said that the guardsmen were confidently ful—
filling socialist pledges in competition for a worthy celebration of the 60th anni-
versary of the Great October.

Party and government leaders attended a tactical exercise and familiarized them-
selves with the life and living arrangements of the personnel. They gave high
praise to the guardsmen's combat schooling.

V. V. Shcherbitskiy chatted with commanders. political workers and the party and
Komsomol activists. He told about the international situation and successes of the
Soviet people and toilers of the Ukraine in fulfilling resolutions of the 25th CPSU
Congress, and dwelled on matters of the need for improving military proficiency and
a further increase in combat readiness. Shcherbitskiy passed on a warm greeting to
the personnel from the CPSU cc General Secretary. Chairman of the Presidium of the
USSR Supreme Soviet Comrade L. I. Brezhnev and from USSR Minister of Defense Mar SU
D. F. Ustinov. He congratulated the soldiers on Victory Day and wished them new
success in strengthening national defenses.

The meetings between leaders of the party and government of the Soviet Ukraine and
the soldiers are vivid proof of the indestructible unity of the party. people and
Army. They help the fighting men and commanders prepare even better for armed
defense of the socialist homeland.

A traditional friendship has formed between cadets of the Donetsk Higher Military-
Political School of Engineer Troops and Signal Troops and the production collective
of the Donetsk Machine Building Plant imeni Leninist Komsomol of the Ukraine, the
Mine imeni Cor'kiy. the Kirovskaya Mine and the Trudovskaya Mine. There are firm

sponsorship ties between personnel of the Kiev Garrison and collectives of the
Arsenal imeni V. I. Lenin. the Leninskaya Kuznitsa Plant ‘4 Others. Kolkhozes and
sovkhozes sponsor military subunits. There are no units in the district which do
not have their sponsors.

The soldiers' relations are developing with creative organizations and figures of
science and the arts. Some 20.000 activities have been conducted in the district
in the year of the 60th anniversary of the Great October through the efforts of
scientists~and workers of culture. Science and Technology Days have turned into a
unique military-technical lecture bureau. Academicians. leading scientists of
scientific research institutes of the Ukrainian 588 AM [Academy of Sciences], and
leaders of industry and agriculture tell the soldiers vividly and figuratively of
the achievements of Soviet science and technology and offer advice on improving
equipment operation and on increasing the effectiveness and culture of military
labor.

Questions of mass defense work hold a special place in sponsorship ties. They are
constantly the focus of attention of republic. oblsst. city and rayon party. soviet
and Komsomol organizations. The joint conduct of courses. seminars and activists'
meetings on preparing the youth for service in the Armed Forces has become a good
tradition.

A noteworthy ritual of sending off draftees for active military service has
originated. This becomes a mass popular holiday with good. thoughtful preparation.
It has become the tradition in the settlement of Rakitnoye. Kiycvskaya Oblast, to
send off future soldiers at the memorial erected in honor of the soldier-victors.
Fierce fighting went on here during the war. Each time the young boys go off to
serve in the Soviet Army they go to the lines where their fathers and grandfathers
fought the hated enemy to the death. Rallies are held here. At one ofthemﬂero SU

the mother of Hero 80 Aleksandr Shevchanko. who repeated the exploit of Gds Pvt A.
Matrosov. also spoke warm. emotional words.

Such send-offs are arranged in a majority of the cities and villages of the Ukraine.
Vivid and memorable. they generate deeply patriotic feelings in the young boys'
awareness and a desire to become steadfast. courageous. ideologically conditioned
defenders of the Motherland.

The military units' ties are growing stronger with schools of cities and villages.
Serviceman sponsor tekhnikums. vocational-technical schools and boarding schools.
Detachments of young friends of the Soviet Army and military-technical circles have
been set up with the active assistance of military personnel. Many Komsomol mem-
bers work in schools as Young Pioneer leaders. The Zarnitsa and Ollenok military
sports games are conducted with their help. "Lessons of Courage." topical evening
and morning gatherings. and mass tours of the youth to places of revolutionary.
combat and labor glory in which servicemen. officers and generals in the reserve
and retired take an active part. have become widespread. Councils of veterans-
countrymen make a great contribution to the noble cause. Many interesting activ-
ities have been conducted by collectives headed by reserve officers 1. T. Kopylov.

The district has established close contact with republic and oblast radio and tele-
vision committees and press entities. Broadcasts and publications on matters of
military-patriotic indoctrination are carried out under plans drawn up with the
participation of commanders. political officers. military commissariat workers and
military journalists. On Sundays television broadcasts "The Soldier's Glory." It
lasts an hour. One hears the words of heroes of the Soviet Union. veterans of the
Soviet Armed Forces. officers and generals, and draft—age and predraft-age youth.
Once a month the broadcast "Soldier's Valor" is heard on the program of the radio
"Young Guard." The radio journal "Senior Classmsn" and the program "Star is Our
Password" also enjoy popularity among the youth.

Military commissariats perform productive work. Relying on the help of party.
soviet and trade union entities. they arrange meetings of persons outstanding in
combat and political training with draftees. contests in applied military sports,
and they carry on correspondence with units where youths they have called up are
serving. DOSAAF organizations are combat assistants of the military commissariats.
Motor transport personnel. parachutists. radio operators and so on are prepared in
their training centers. Every third draftee sent into the Armed Forces from the
Ukraine has a military-technical specialty. DOSAAF organizations of Voroshilcv-
gradskaya. Dnepropetrovskaya. Donetakaya. Kiyevskaya and(nmrnigovskaya oblasts
showed their best side in this work.

Based on results of competition. the district's military commissariats have held
leading places in the Armed Forces for a number of years. The Donetskaya Oblast
Military Conmusaariat won first place twice. second place twice and third place
once; Dnepropetrovskaya Oblast Military Commissariat won first place twice. and
second and third place once each; and Chernigovsksya Oblast Military Commissariat
mnta second place and won third place twice. They were presented with Challenge
Red Banners and a challenge prize of the USSR Ministry of Defense. For taking a
prize place three years in a row. the Chernigovakaya Oblast Military Commissariat
received the Ministry of Defense Challenge Prize for permanent retention.

Assistance to the local populace is an age-old tradition of the district which
arose back at the dawn of its birth and which was strengthened in subsequent years.
This noble quality shone with new facets in the 1977 harvest. That year the
Ukrainian agricultural toilers grew a major harvest of grain. sugsrbeets. potatoes
and other crops. The state was sold 1.127 billion pooda of grain and over 50
million tons of sugarbeets.

District motor transport personnel also made their contribution to the labor vic-
lnry ur the Ukrainian people. Best results in transporting the harvest wvrv
achichd. in various years. by the subunits headed by officers A. P. Borzenkov. P.
L. outlyutulltn. V. M. Kov'yur. Ye. V. Huger. L. S. Motovitskiy. A. Ya. Rodionov
and V. l. Starchenko. The leaders were commended by the Presidium of the Ukrainian
SSR Supreme Soviet. the Komsomol CC and the Ukrainian Komaomol CC.

Combat engineers enjoy great respect among the populace. Their help is extremely
necessary to this day. The rusty heritage of the war is discovered here and there.
In just the last five years combat engineers have visited 17,000 points. They have
neutralized hundreds of thousands of dangerous explosive objects. Among people of

this courageous profession are officers V. A. Mironov and N. S. Romanov. who have
been awarded the Order of Red Star.

Celebrations dedicated to the 60th anniversary of the Soviet Ukraine left a deep
trace in the awareness or district personnel. Meetings. evening and morning
gatherings. lectures. briefings and talks about successes of the Soviet people in
building communism and about the magnificent victories of the party in implementing
the Luninist policy of nationalities took place in combined units, units and mili-
tary educational institutions. District personnel are proud of the fact that the
Ukraine--an equal among equal Soviet republ 1cs--is making a worthy contribution to
strengthening the economic and defense might of our Motherland. the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

A parade of Kiev Garrison troops took place on 24 Decenber 1977. Passing along the
Kreshchatik in parade formation. the best representatives of the district denun—
strated fraternal feelings toward the Ukrainian people, who are heading constantly
and confidently toward communism along with all peoples of the multinational social-
ist state. Their labor is under the reliable protection of valorous Soviet mili-
tary personnel.

The Chronicle Continues

The jubilee year of 1977 went down in history as a vivid. unforgettable page. It
gladdened everyone with remarkable successes in military labor and in the life and
work of subunits, units and military educational institutions. Such is the custom
that a good predecessor must have a worthy successor.

Personnel of units which were initiators and leaders in competition in honor of the
60th anniversary of the Great October again turned to all personnel of the USSR
Armed Forces with an appeal to continue the jubilee conpetwtion in 1978. The motto
of the struggle is inspiring: "Reliably defend the socialist homeland, be in con-
stant combat readiness, persistently master weapons and equipment. improve your
combat proficiency and make the year of the 60th anniversary of the USSR Armed
Forces a year of vital military labor." And personnel of the Taman' Red Banner
Order of Suvorov Guards Motorized Rifle Division imeni H. I. Kalinin suggested
stepping up the intensity of competition for foremost coutined unit.

Guardsmen of the order-bearing combined unit where Lt Col M. I. Rudachenko is chief
of the political department and which was famed in the war years were first in the
district to support the patriotic initiative. Through the district newspaper they
called on their contemporaries to improve military and political knowledge stead-
fastly, to develop persistently one's comuniat convictions and high mcral-
political and combat qualities. and to maintain at a high level the readiness to
defend the achievements of socialism.‘ The guardsmen set forth concretely their
program of action. The basis of their plan was Lenin's direction not to dwell on
what had been achieved but to go forward and achieve more.

The military council and political directorate supported the guardsmen's initiative
and expressed firm conviction that district personnel would unfold the struggle to
implement resolutions of the 25th CPSU Congress even more vigorously and'would lurk
the new training year-~the year of the 60th anniversary of the USSR Armed Forces-
with shock military labor and a further increase in combat readiness of units and
combined units.

successfully fulfilled.

the Letter of the CPSU CC. USSR Council of Ministers. AUCC'l'U and Komsomol CC to
aarty. soviet. economic. trade union and Komsomsl organisations and workers of the
Soviet Union entitled "On Developing Socialist Competition for ?ulfillment and
)verfulfillment of the 1978 Plan and lntensification of the Struggle for Increasing
Effectiveness and Quality of Her " had a beneficial effect on organizational and
ideological work in those days. It was discussed at management conferences. in
political entities of combined units. units and military educational institutions,
and in party. Komsomol and trade union organizations. The party's call to work
even better found a fervent response in the hearts of soldiers, workers and
employees and multiplied their energy in the struggle to achieve higher results in
military labor and in fulfillment of production plans.

The 19th district Komsomol conference held on 9 February 1978 was a noteworthy
event in the life of the youth. It examined the question "0n progress in fulfill—
ing resolutions of the 25th CPSU Congress and the 17th Romsomol Congress on
communist indoctrination of the Army youth and ways of further increasing the
activeness of Komsomol organizations in high-quality accomplishment of tasks
assigned by the USSR Minister of Defense for 1978, and on a worthy greeting to the
60th anniversary of the Soviet Armed Forces and the All-Union Leninist Communist
Youth League." Capt V. C. Dobrovol'skiy. assistant chief of the district political
directorate for Komsomol work. gave a briefing. The agenda of the day was dis—
cussed in an atmosphere of efficiency. fundamental criticism and self-criticism.
Delegates demonstrated the fervent desire of Kousomol meubers and young soldiers to
park the year of the 60th anniversary of the Armed Forces and Leninist Kemsomol
with a further increase in combat readiness. an improvement in the quality of com—
bat schooling and comprehensive mastery of new equipment and weapons.

"The Soviet Armed Forces on guard over the achievements of the Great October.
Embodiment of Lenin's ideas of defense of the socialist homeland in the USSR Con-
stitution." Participating in it was A. P. Botvin. member of the Ukrainian
Conmmnist Party Central Committee Politburo and first secretary of the Kiev party
gorkom; F. .. Rudich, chief of the department of science and universities of the cc
CP of the Ukraine; V. V. Kulik, secretary of the Kiev party gorkom; veterans of the
USSR Armed Forces; and writers.

A review was performed of museums and libraries of combined units and units. The
best were presented with awards of the ClC of the Ground Forces. the district
commander and the Ukrainian Society for Protection of Monuments of History and Cul-
ture. The district political directorate together with republic creative organiza-
tions made the film entitled "Kiev Red Banner." and put out phonograph records with
a recording of performances by the Honored Ensemble of the Ukrainian SSR and of the
District Song and Dance Ensemble. A republic art exhibit was opened in Kiev
entitled "60 Heroic Years." and there were photo exhibits in oblast cities dedi-
cated to the Soviet Armed Forces and the everyday routine of district troops.

0n the eve of the Armed Forces jubilee, the district military council. commanders
and political entities of combined units and units. and the heads of local soviet
entities held a reception and honor ceremony for Army and Navy veterans and war
participants. District leaders and generals and officers of the staff and direc-
torates were warmly congratulated by CPSU CC Politburo Member. First Secretary of
the CP of the Ukraine V. V. Shcherbitskiy.

Results of the fulfillment of socialist pledges in honor of the 60th anniversary of
the Soviet Army and Navy were summarized on 20 February at a session of the dis-
trict military council. There was a reception of socialist competition winners.

A large group of personnel were commended by the USSR Minister of Defense, district
commander and the commanders of Combined unite and units for high indicators in
combat and political training. Many were awarded certificates of the Presidium of
the Ukrainian SSR Supreme Soviet. Among the generals and officers commended were
N. P. Babich. D. P. Baaov, V. H. Galinov. V. P. Gubenko. A. S. Yelagin. N. c.
Kochan. Yu. S. Kitichenko. A. K. Kozlov. V. V. Komerov. V. I. Hurstov. G. C.
Skovnrodko. F. I. Teleshev, V. I. Tsvetkov and others.

Following celebration of the 60th anniversary of the USSR Armed Forces the politi-
cal and labor intensity in troop units built up under the motto "An outstanding
result for the jubilee year." District personnel perfected their combat expertise
at firing ranges. training ranges. tank training areas. in classrooms and in the
field. they persistently mastered new equipment and weapons and became mentally and
physically conditioned. Generals and officersof the district staff and director-
ates are directly among the troops for a large part of the time. teach commanders
and political officers the forms and methods of training and indoctrinating person-
nel and the organization of socialist competition. and help remedy deficiencies.

Resolutions of the [8th Komsomol Congress and the theses and conclusions contained
in the striking. deeply reasoned speech by CPSU CC General Secretary. Chairman of
the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet, Comrade L. I. Brezhnev helped further
improve the coummnist indoctrination of soldiers. to mobilize them for successful
accomplishment of combat and political training tasks. and to increase the politi-
cal vigilance and combat readiness of personnel of combined units. units and

military educational institutions. Practical tasks of military collectives were
discussed at a meeting of the district Komsomol aktiv and in combined units and
units. Congress materials and the speech by Comrade Brezhnev were studied in
detail in the system of political studies for personnel and KomsOmol political
enlightenment. All the work was carried out under the sign of a worthy greeting to
the 60th anniversary of the Leninist Komsomol. Its results were sunmmrized at the
All—Union Komsomol Meeting “True to Lenin's Behests." The number of persons out-
standing in combat and political training. rated specialists. ranking athletes and
shock workers of communist labor increased noticeably among Komsomol members in
district troop units.

Many Komsomol members in district units and combined units became winners of compe-
tition for the right to sign the Report of Komsomol Menbers of the USSR Armed
Forces to the CPSU Central Committee in honor of the 60th anniversary of the Lenin-
ist Komsomol. The report of Komsonol soldiers to the military council and district
political directorate stated that 35 percent of KomsomOI members in foremost com-
bined units and units greeted the glorious 60th anniversary jubilee of the Komsomol
as persons designated outstanding in the Soviet Army, 65 percent of the soldiers as
specialists with a higher class rating. over 40 percent of subunits headed by
commanders who were Komsomol members had become outstanding. and 51 percent of
teams. squads and crews had achieved full interchangeability. Among competition
winners 85 percent had been awarded 3-6 badges of soldier valor and 197 persons
were shock workers of communist labor.

A ceremony of the Komsomol aktiv of Kiev Garrison dedicated to the 60th anniversary
of the KomSOmol was held in the district officers' club. Col Con V. T. Dement'yev,
member of the military council and chief of the district political directorate.
spoke to the KomsOmol acrivists. I. S. Dunayev. a veteran of the party and Kon-
SOmOl and a delegate to the 3d RKSM [Russian Communist Youth League] Congress,
greeted participants of the ceremonial meeting. A. I. Korniyenko. first secretary
of the Ukrainian Komsomol CC, told of the high political and labor enthusiasm in
Ukrainian Komsomol organizations. District commander Arm Gen I. A. Gerasimov con-
gratulated participants of the ceremonial meeting warmly. He called on all per-
sonnel to struggle to ensure that the Red Banner Kiev Military District was the
leading district in the USSR Armed Forces.

Participants of the ceremonial meeting received with enormous enthusiasm the letter
to the Central Committee of the Conmuniat Party of the Soviet Union and to the CPSU

CC General Secretary, Chairman of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet. Comrade
Leonid ll'ich Brezhnev.

The July 1978 CPSU CC Plenum; Comrade Brezhnev's speeches during his trip to
:cgluns of Siberia and the Far East and in presenting high governmental awards of
the Motherland to the city-hero of Minsk and to Baku; his new work "Tselina" [The
Virgin Lands]; as well as adoption of the new Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR,
celebration of the 75th anniversary of the 2d RSDRP [Russian Social Denncratic
Labor Party] Congress. the 60th anniversary of the lat KP(b)U [Communist Party
(Bolshevik) of tho Ukraine] Congress. and the 1st anniversary of adoption of the
Basic Law of the USSR were powerful incentives for a further increase in the polit-
ical and military activeness of the personnel.

the CPSU's measures in domestic and foreign policy, and to mobilize personnel for
successful performance of missions assigned by the USSR Minister of Defense for the
1978 training year. The work of agitprop collectives. lecture and agitprop groups.
political briefers and agitators became more profound and meaningful. The following
generals and officers proved themselves to be capable propagandists: A. P. Andreyev.
S. D. Burdo. L. P. Glushkevich. V. I. Gordeyev, Ye. I. Zelenov, V. s. Kuznetsov, H.
G. Harichev. A. P. Pluzhnikov. I. D. Stopnikov. l. P. Sokirko. N. N. Tolkachev. V.
Ye. Tret'yakov. L. c. Trunin. V. B. Khachaturyan. N. I. Chernechkov. I. I. Yankin
and others.

Considerably assisting in stepping up agitprop work were the CPSU CC decrees
entitled "0n the Status and Measures for Improving Lecture Propaganda“ and “On
Raising the Role of Verbal Political Agitation in Fulfilling Resolutions of the
25th CPSU Congress"; Comrade Brerhnev's work "Aktual'nyye voprosy ideologicheskoy
rsboty KPSS" [Current Issues of CPSU Ideological Work]; and the Directive of the
USSR Minister of Defense and Chief of the Main Political Directorate of the Soviet
Army and Navy entitled "0n Haas Agitation work in the Soviet Army and Navy." This
work is being carried out under plans approved by the district military council.
Troop units regularly hold five-day training methods courses for T/OSE propagan-
dists. They are a good school of propaganda expertise and an important factor in
the further improvement of ideological work and an increase in its quality and
effectiveness.

The jubilee year of 1978 remained in the memory of district personnel as a year of
great achievements. It was the year of a further improvement in the personnel's
combat schooling. Generals. officers. warrant officers. NCO's. privates and Soviet
Army employees bent much effort to prepare and successfully conduct a number of
important exercises. A step forward was taken in improving the work style of
staffs. Their role in command and control rose. Much military-scientific work was
conducted in the district.

District leaders were received by CPSU CC Politburo Heuber, USSR Minister of
Defense Mar 80 D. F. Ustinov. A number of issues touching on troop life and activ-
ities were resolved positively.

A district management conference on Comrade Brezhnev's book "Tselins" was held in
early December. It was opened by Col Gen V. T. Damsnt'yev. member of the military
council and chief of the district political directorate. District commander Arm
Gen 1. A. Cerasimov. CPSU CC candidate member and Ukrainian Communist Party CC
Politburo candidate member. gave the briefing entitled "Comrade L. I. Brezhnev's
book 'Tselins‘ is a vivid chronicle of the great exploit by the party and people."

It was emphasized at the congress that publication of Comrade Brezhnev's book
"Tselina" was an outstanding event in the ideological-political life of Soviet
society. Being a natural and organic continuation of the books "Malaya Zemlya" and
"Vozrozhdeniye." "Tselina" teaches an evaluation and analysis of past experience in
a Leninist manner. At the same time. one visualizes in the book the clear and con-
sistent concern for the future and a scientific approach to resolving urgent prob-
lems of modern times. Brezhnev‘s new book calls on Soviet military personnel for
new achievements in military labor for the glory of the socialist homeland.

Foreword

[Excerpg/ In writing the handbook the group of authors had the aim of providing
information on military topography in a convenient form for the reader. The refer-
ence material is systematised according to the following basic divisions: topog-
raphical and special maps, map measurements, aerial photographs of terrain. terrain
study. measurements on terrain and target designation and terrain orientation.
Information not introduced into thematic chapters is given in a separate chapter in
an alphabetical-lexical account and by individual points (paragraphs). Examples

of topographical maps, conventional symbols of topographical maps and a list of
abbreviations used on maps are included in the supplement.

For the convenience of using the handbook and of rapid location of necessary
information, the basic concepts and methods of operation are typed separately in each

chapter. Moreover, an alphabetical-subject index is located in the handbook with the
aid of which the reader can rapidly find concepts or terms that interest him.

During compilation of the handbook. regulations, lectures and 'uides of the Soviet
Army and regulations and guides on topographical. geodesic and :artograpbic opera-
tions as well as textbooks and training manuals on military topography and
topogeodesic security of combat troop operations were used.

18
FOR OPFICIAL USE ONLY

During rework of the handbook. changes of corresponding regulations and guides were
taken into account, questions associated with the use of new technology were included,

and some secondary information (the technique of topographic training of soldiers.
tables of trigonometric functions and others) included.

Taking into account that detailed information on one or another question can be

obtained by the reader from corresponding regulations and guides and from textbooks
and training manuals, the authors of the handbook directed main attention to brevity
of the exposition, to accessability and the convenience of finding information, and
they aspired to make the exposition stand up in a scientific respect. Much informa-

tion on military topography is interrelated. therefore references to other points
(paragraphs) are in the handbook.

With deep gratitude the authors will accept criticise from readers on content of the
handbook and suggestions for its inprovenent.

FRENCH SOURCE (XI SOVIET mm OWSIVE TACTICS
Paris MES D'AUJOURD'IIUI in French Nov 81 pp 20-23

[Article by Jacques Priedberg, fellow at CEPODE (Center for Defense Policy Studies,
Universtiy of Paris I. Sorbonne): "Soviet Tactics for Breaching Antitsnk Defenses"]

[Text] The author's thorough con-and of Russian has enabled his to
analyze articles appearing in specialized military periodicals and.
as a result. describe for us a Soviet battalion commander's concerns
over how to comter the effects of "new battlefield weapons" as
effectively as possible. The general information obtained by sinply
perusing the Soviet ailitary press will no doubt be of interest to
our readers. The author's consents are based on his analysis of
articles in VOENNYI VBSTNIK, a Russian nilitary review that serves
as an instructional and training aid for Soviet Army officers and
nco's. It publishes either opinions, or reports on standard field
exercises and original experinents, all relative to tactics, morale,
and political matters. With the exception of its editorial which
presents the official viewpoint, the review's articles do not
necessarily reflect Soviet doctrine or regulations. They are
primarily part of the high coalnnd'e effort to increase officer

and NCO interest in tactics. They reflect the main stress of

ideas flowing from officers and NCO'a to higher headquarters

and staffs.

Ever since the Arab-Israeli Her of October 1973, the doctrine for battlefield
employment of tanks has been the subject of intensive controversy. 0n the one hand,
the exceptional success rate of aissiles proapted the belief that the tank was
obsolescent. Yet the Israeli counter offensive against the Syrians and BSYPtians
was crowned with success. These events established the definite fact that the tank
was no longer the absolute offensive weapon.

Far removed from nedia publicity, the Soviet general staff was itself obliged to take
into account the results of that war waged by both sides with the type of modern
equipment the USSR'e potential adversaries in the European theater of operation
would have.

In the Soviet view, however, the tank is still the backbone of all operational
military strategy. For then, it is the spearhead in the breakthrough phase and the
main instrument for the exploitation phase conducted deep inside enemy rear areas.

20

Its advantages. compared with other combat weapons, in a nuclear environment or in
a conventional war naturally make the tank the most suitable means of accomplishing
missions of this type. The large percentage of Soviet units equipped with armored
vehicles of recent manufacture-vsrious versions of the T-72 tank--proves, without
any doubt. the confidence Soviet staffs have in the operational capabilities of
armored formations. Consequently the major problem is not one of reconsidering the
priority given to the tank or of seeking another means of conducting offensive
operations, but rather one of adapting the tank and its eaployment doctrine to the
new threat.

Without making too hasty a judgement about the technological defense discoveries
made by the most probable enemy, NATO that is, developments such as third-generation
missiles. remotely-delivered minefields, enhanced radiation weapons. etc.. it is
essential to devise a functional tactical solution to the problem of front-line
antitank barriers deployed in Europe. Such a solution is beginning to show through
in a few articles published in the Soviet military press. The points developed
therein offer a new perspective of the course of military operations in the forward
battle. while the use of nuclear weapons is not broached in these articles, and
while the arguments advanced do not have the authority of doctrine, the proposals
made continue to uphold the enduring importance of the offensive as a means of
waging war.

Tactical Principles

The basic principle of Soviet tactics is cooperation between the various combat arms:
combined arms operations extended to the third dimension. It is by judiciously
using all of the means at his disposal that the wit con-lander can hope to control
his scheme of maneuver.

At tank or motorized battalion level. the unit comander has a small staff with which
to plan and coordinate his scheme of maneuver with reinforcing units: a tank or
motorized company. an antisircraft artillery section, a section from the NBC [nuclear,
biological, chemical] reconnaissance detachment. an artillery battalion with three
batteries. each with six pieces. and an engineer section. Bis higher headquarters
may allocate exceptional reinforcements, such as. for example, other tank or notorized
companies. obstacle-crossing equipment. antitank support, air support (fixed-wing
aircraft or helicopters), and artillery support with multiple rocket launchers.
Ibwever. the battalion commander is always solely responsible for employment of his
troops.

Command

The Soviet Army very closely follows developments in western antitank weapons and
tactics. particularly within the American and West German armies which make up the
bulk of NATO forces. It also analyzes the tactical dispositions employed by these
armies.1 in addition to a clear perception of the capabilities of one's own forces,
knowledge of the enemy's weapons is an indispensable condition of success.2 From
such knowledge, it is possible to deduce. for example, the most likely areas for
deployment of missiles. The Soviet officer is trained to conduct on-site
reconnaissance and personally make visual observations of his maneuver ares, thus
supplementing his theoretical knowledge of that area. In combat, information

’1

son omcfu. use ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

obtained by observations made by the battalion's subordinate units are centralized,
particularly the data obtained by artillery forward observers, the battalion's
reconnaissance unit (dozor). and the engineer reconnaissance unit. The battalion’s
higher headquarters may conduct radio, electronic, and air surveillance missions.
All of the data thus obtained should enable the battalion commander to determine
the axes of advance for his attack, the means to be employed. and their deployment
according to the quality of the enemy defenses and their organization.

Preparation, Control of Combat Operations

This involves coordinating the action of the battalion's different camponents,
choosing a good tempo for the attack in coordination with the delivery of supporting
fire and with engineer activities in support of the advance. Subordinate units must
be very closely controlled to ensure their coordinated action. It seems difficult

to reconcile this latter requirement with the spirit of initiative demanded in

modern combat or simply with the uncertain operation of radio communications. In any
case, an exact plan must be drawn up prior to leaving the line of departure.

Instruction and training take on special importance. There are. for example, a few
simple techniques that make it possible to reduce the effectiveness of enemy fire
against a moving vehicle, such as changing the speed of the advance, utilisation of
natural obstacles, advancing in serpentine fashion, etc.3 The soldier facing a
difficult situation must also be prepared psychologically. This is where the unit's
political structures play their part, whether it be the party or communist youth
organizations, "socialist emulation." Frequent field exercises conducted under the
most realistic conditions possible must give tank crews the reflexes required to
engage rapidly appearing targets of opportunity.“

Enemy's Antitank Capabilities

The tank faces a manifold threat on the battlefield. This threat may come from tactical
air support aircraft, guided missiles or rockets, helicopters, field artillery and
even antiaircraft artillery delivering direct fire, other tanks, or mines. of all
these threats, the guided missile threat engages the most Soviet attention because
it is the one on which Westerners rely the most. Guided missiles are steadily
increasing in density throughout the combat zone.5 A missile's qualities are
determined by: reliability that does not depend upon range, capability of piercing
every type of armor, and great accuracy of fire. The T0" and HOT missiles have a
kill probability of 80-90 percent against a stationary target at a range of 3-k,000
meters. At that range, the missile is protected from the tank's fire. Until it is
launched. the missile is not very visible and is difficult to detect. "hen mounted
on a vehicle. it becomes as mobile as the tank. Mounted on a helicopter, it is even
more mobile.

0n the other hand, its weaknesses include: its time of flight and, as a result. its
reduced rate of fire, hence giving the tank gun an advantage; limited visibility
(rain. fog) which lowers its kill probability; the fact that the missile crew has to
move to a new position after firing its first round because the latter betrays its
position. In addition, the missile cannot be guided until it has completed the first
500 to 600 meters of its flight. To determine their plan of attack. Soviets assess

22

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

enemy defensive positions precisely on the basis of the missile's characteristics.

A typical defensive position is depicted as consisting of a motorized battalion with
a special antitank reserve. Two of its companies are deployed in a strongpoint with
a 360-degree firing capability. The defensive tactic consists in taking tanks under
fire as soon as they near the forward edge of the battle area, channeling their
advance by means of natural obstacles or minefields laid throughout the depth of the
position, i.e. approximately 4 kilometers, then attacking them from the flank, if
necessary with supporting fire from armed helicopters, dug—in tanks, and artillery
used in the direct-fire role. Hinefields and antitank obstacles are sited throughout
the depth of the position and in the area in front of it.

Special attention is given to the possibility of being confronted with mines rapidly
scattered by helicopter, fixed-wing aircraft. or artillery. The problem posed by
armed helicopters is outside the strict scope of the breaching of antitank barriers,
but it is the subject of a separate study6 encompassing the different phases of
combat operations. Acceptance of the helicopter and the role assigned to it in the
maneuver of forces prove to what extent the Soviets consider it a potential danger
requiring exceptional vigilance. This is one of the reasons for the rapid pace of
the helicopter build-up in the Warsaw Pact forces.

Special Tactics for Overcoming Antitank Barriers

0n the basis of the principles Outlined above, the Soviet unit commander will employ
a certain number of special tactics to help him accomplish his mission. First, we
must underscore the continuity which exists, according to the Soviets. at least at
the "operational art" level; between a conventional warfare situation and a nuclear
or chemical warfare situation. Battlefield use of these weapons is but one means of
delivering large-scale supporting fire which must be exploited immediately as if it
were fire from conventional artillery or tactical air support aircraft. That is why,
even in the conventional phase, the Soviets are prepared to shift without warning
into the NBC phase, because their disposition of forces is already adapted to such
warfare and their equipment has the technical capability of withstanding NBC attacks.
The customary mass troop concentrations of world Her II will no longer be seen.

This latter principle has been replaced by the principle of combined arms and mobility.
It must also be emphasized that tactical air support is an army responsibility and

is furnished only along the main axes of advance. This support is mentioned here
solely for informational purposes, but it may be decisive in a good number of cases
because of its concentration.

Artillery. Engineer Support

Artillery observation posts must be so located as to cover an observing sector
extending at least 4,000 meters beyond the enemy front lines. If forward observers
follow the tanks in the attack, they must be able to direct fire upon the flanks
and reverse slopes where the enemy's missiles are deployed. Each battery must be
capable of firing simultaneously at two point targets a few hunPred meters apart
(distance between two missile firing positions). The artillery must have the
capability of delivering nonprearranged fire in support of troops on the line of
contact. and also be prepared to blind certain sectors with smoke shells.

The engineer section's action begins at the line of contact where minefields are
likely. To neutralize them, the section uses special bangalore torpedoes rapidly
emplaced in the depths of the minefield. The section also helps mount heavy demining
rollers (KMT-S mine sweeper) on the lead tank and trains the crew on their use.

Other tanks are equipped with simpler rollers. During its reconnaissance, the
engineer detachment marks out those lanes deemed most favorable to a rapid advance.
During the attack it accompanies the lead elements for the same purpose. The section
tries to widen the lanes through the minefield for the second echelon. The section
may be reinforced with obstacle-crossing equipment if such obstacles as tank ditches
or marshy areas are detected. Lastly, it may be ordered to nine probable axes of
counterattacks by enemy tanks, particularly on the attacker's flanks. Excellent
coordination is required between engineer activities, the advance of armred units,
and cessation of artillery fire.

Action of Advancing Armored Unics7

After assigning to support units those targets to be neutralized so as to further the
advance of armored units, the battalion commander then indicates direct-fire targets
for the tanks and BMP's (armored personnel carriers armed with a 73-11:: gun and antitank
missile launcher). As a general rule, the tanks fire, in salvo if possible, upon
enemy tanks and long-range missile positions. The BMP's fire upon personnel and
short-range missiles. The tanks keep as close as possible to the artillery's creeping
barrage. The BMP's follow very close behind the tanks so as to intensify fire

against the defenders and observation posts, while at the same time producing a
psychological effect. If the advance through difficult terrain is in colum formation,
tanks and BHP's try to deploy in line for the actual assault. In open terrain,

they will advance in serpentine fashion. while breaking the tempo of the advance,
thereby making it difficult for enemy missile crews. Tank crews receive special
training in target recognition and assessment of their importance, selection of
appropriate amunition, rapid delivery of fire upon the target and its destruction
with the first round.8 In the attack, the tank and BM? will be close to each other
and mutually support each other with fire from their weapons.

The Soviets expect to have their troops acquire the reflexes necessary for this type
of engagement by having them undergo intensive training under conditions as close as
possible to actual combat on specially designed and equipped ranges and courses,

and above all by frequent field exercises.

Countering Antitank Helicopters

The Soviets constantly reiterate that. for Westerners, the attack helicopter has bedome
one of the most effective weapon systems, because it has very great maneuverability
and more and more decisive firepower. It can be armed with guided missiles, rockets,
rapid-fire cannon, droppable mines, and incendiary devices. It is a general~purpose
platform for carrying weapons and personnel mder modern combat conditions. Its
qualities enable it to deliver surprise strikes during the assembly and approach

march phases as well as during the attack.

The Soviets hel ieve that Western helicopters will be employed in pairs (one or two) or
in groups of six. and against the following targets, in the following order of
priority: tanks, antiaircraft weapons, couand vehicles, M's. etc. Their tactic

21:
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

will consist in firing on targets at maximum range. namely from 5,000 meters at

minimum altitude, i.e. 50 meters at most, using the "flea hop" method when the terrain
is open and the ambush method when the terrain is wooded. As a general rule. they

will fly in line. Accurate knowledge of their tactics should enable the Soviet
battalion commander to anticipate the probable directions of attack and hence deploy
his antiaircraft weapons accordingly, especially if he cannot rely on air cover from

a higher echelon. The battalion is reinforced by antiaircraft artillery (AA)-4 guns-—
or surface-to-air missiles. (Noteworthy is the AA's effectiveness in direct fire upon
tanks).

Moreover, it is always possible to deduce the location of helicopter waiting positions
or helicopter maintenance and supply depots which can be fired on by field artillery.
The infantry is armed with man-portable infrared-homing missiles. These light

weapons are always effective at short range when employed in concentrated fire. Even

a tank's gun can hope to bring down a low-flying aircraft.9 To reduce the effectiveness
or fire from helicopters, the Soviets recommend utilization of the terrain (defilade),
bad weather conditions, night attacks. or even smoke screens. Each tank is fitted

with thermo-condensation smoke-generating equipment and high-capacity smoke pots.
Decontamination teams have a machine, the THS-65, which can also be used as a smoke
generator.

The principle of concentrating fire support weapons replaces the principle of
concentrating troops and vehicles. when this firepower is concentrated, the unit
commander may then hope to overcome antitank obstacles.

Introduction of the enhanced radiation weapon10 will prompt the Soviets to seek first
a technical solution such as special shielding for tank crews, but also some form of
tactical counteraction. In addition, consideration is being given to increased ways
and means of maintaining surveillance of probable neutron-weapon launchers, such as
artillery and missiles. In any case. absolute priority will be given to their
destruction. 0n the other hand. use of such weapons by the Soviets themselves may
prove decisive against NATO forward positions, against antitank barriers in particular.
Actually. the only really planned counteraction consists in further increasing the
mobility of units, and hence making greater use of helicopters to fill gaps on the
battlefield.

"Standard" nuclear weapons make the exploitation phase more difficult when troops

have to cross a contaminated area or an area in which material destruction impedes

their rate of advance. This latter disadvantage can be avoided by using chemical
warfare agents. Although the Soviets publish only chemical warfare defense information,
they are giving use of chemical agents an increasingly important place on the
battlefield. and certainly for protection of the attacker's flanks.

As mpintvd out by C.N. Donnelly.‘1 the way the Soviets tackle the problem of antitank
defenses is not “devoid of common sense." but there is no single straightforward

answer or absolute weapon. In the final analysis, the chances of success rest upon

the individual and collective combat readiness of the troops. Hhile the task is not
deemed impossible. it still is very costly. It is obvious that by the end of the

assault phase, a tank battalion's capacity to exploit its own success will be very
diminished. Hence a second echelon completely replacing the first. no longer in

fighting condition. becomes an imperative necessity. The helicopter, with its capability

2

of operating in great depth, is also available to replace the tank or give it
indispensable support. For the present, can recourse to massed and highly mobile
supporting fire offset or reduce losses in the initial phases of the attack? The

speed and sustained tempo of the attack depend upon coordination betveen the different
components of the forces and also between echelons. We nust not, however, overlook

the importance of the phychological factor in the battle, a factor to which the Soviets,
from experience, always accord predominance.

From the Author

The years go by. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party. the Soviet peo-
ple are accomplishing the grandiose tasks of peaceful construction in our country.
The combat effectiveness and might of the Soviet Union's Armed Forces are growing.
New people who have not taken the difficult tests of the older generation come to
replace honored veterans of labor and the Great Patriotic war.

But time does not have the power to drive from the people's memory the names of
those who gave all their energy. knowledge. experience and life to a common cause--

selfless dedication and service to our beloved Hotherland and the building of
communism.

I have worked on this book for several years. I would like to describe the life
and combat career of a remarkable person. the prominent and talented military
leader Mitrofan Ivanovich Nedelin. with when my service was linked. For me it was
always a great good fortune bringing full moral satisfaction to work with this
superb. fascinating person and to carry out with him the difficult and responsible
missions of creating and developing the Strategic Missile Forces.

I knew much about our hero personally. Hitrofan Ivanovich'a constant companion.
his wife Mariya Dmitriyevns. his daughter Lyudmila Hitrofanovna. as well as his
companions in arms and friends told me warmly about him. and I express to them my
most sincere gratitude and thanks.

Written and verbal reminiscences of veterans of the Rocket and Artillery Troops
were an invaluable help to me in working on the book. I was ab) . use this docu-
mentary and historic material in far from a complete manner. but all letters I
received. copies of [rontline and postwar newspapers and journals. and photographs
are kept carefully in memory of our outstanding contemporary and as material for
future books about him and for museum exhibits.

I will consider my task fulfilled if this book sparks the interest and enthusiasm
not only of representatives of the older generation. but also our youth. the
soldier-Kamaomol members who now stand in formation of defenders of our socialist
homeland.

Introduction

Military topography is one of the mandatory training subjects for soldiers. It pro-
vides knowledge of the terrain and methods of studying it. and teaches techniques
of orientation on the terrain and capable use of topographic maps.

Combat actions take place on the terrain. and the methods of troop actions and
techniques of employing combat equipment and weapons depend on the terrain's influ-
ence. A proper evaluation of its tactical and protective features and capable use
of these features contributes to success in combat. This is why it is very impor-
tant to be able to study terrain rapidly. orient oneself on it confidently and use
it correctly.

All information about the terrain is customarily called topographic data. The
topographic map serves as the primary source of obtaining these data. It has wide
application both in the national economy and in military affairs. The map is
referred to by pupil and scientist. officer and enlisted man. It is used by people
of quite varied specielites connected with the study and use of the terrain and
natural resources. In a combat situation a topographic map is the comander's con-
stant companion. He uses it to study the combat situation. to make his decision
for combat, to assign missions to his subordinates and to control the subunits in
combat. One can not only study the terrain and orient oneself on it from the map.
but also determine target coordinates and perform precise measurements and calcula-
tions for launching missiles and for effective employment of other contemporary
weapons.

The compass is used widely as a supplement to the topographic lap in orientation on
the terrain. Compass orientation is used especially widely when moving along bear-
ings under difficult terrain conditions and with restricted visibility. and so it
always is given much attention in training.

This book contains generalized material on those basic questions of military
topography which predraft-aga youth must know. Readers are given questions in each
section which require reflection and which have the purpose of sparking interest in
the subject material and reinforcing knowledge obtained.

it is impossible to use a topographic nap for accomplishing various tasks and to
orient oneself on the terrain without practical skills in working with the map and
compass. The book gives many interesting problems for the purpose of instilling
practical skills. and trainees can solve them on their own or under the instruc-
tor's direction. Solutions to these problems or recommendations for practicing
various techniques are given at the end of the book.

Becoming Familiar with the Terrain

The combat actions of ground forces are conducted on the terrain. and it makes per-
formance of the combat mission easier or more difficult depending on its nature.
Terrain can provide troops and combat equipment with cover against the effects of
nuclear and conventional weapons. It affects conditions of movement. camouflage.
and conduct of fire; and it affects concealment of troop actions. Alignment of the
combat formation. selection of firing positions and observation posts and the use
of combat equipment depends to a significant extent on the nature of terrain. One
and the same terrain will provide more advantages to a person who studies it better
and uses it more capably.

The terrainis studied by various methods. but basically by a direct inspection and
from topographic maps. The training subject concerning the terrain and methods of
studying it and using it in combat is called military topography. Reading a
topographic map and orientation on the terrain comprise the primary content of
military topography as applied to military training of predraft-age youth.

Topographic Maps

The topographic map is used widely among the troops. The commander uses it to
study and estimate the combat situation. to make a decision. to organize coordina-
tion and to control subunits in combat. The topographic map is used for orienta-
tion on the terrain for preparing artillery fire and missile launches. But to use
a map successfully, one must have an idea of how it is constructed and what it can-
teina.

Orientation on the Terrain

The ability to orient oneself on the terrain is of great importance for successful
conduct of troop combat actions. Orientation on the terrain means determining the
cardinal points and one's location with respect to local terrain features and ele-
ments of the relief. choosing the necessary direction of movement and maintaining
this direction en route. We orient ourselves on the terrain from a topographic map
or. lacking this. using a compass. celestial bodies. or other very simple methods.

Training in Military Topography

Hllitnry topography is among the subjects which are Linked organically with tactics.
A knowledge of military topography permits the fullest estimate of the terrain.
making the most correct decision for combat. and better organizing observation. the
conduct of fire and control of the subunit in combat. Military topOgraphy also has
a close tie with specialized and technical training subjects. since it is necessary
to study methods of using combat and specialized equipment on the terrain for its
proper employment.

Basic training of predraft-ege youth in military topography has the primary task of
teaching them to read a topographic map. perform the simplest measurements on it

and orient themselves on the terrain. These questions comprise the basis of topo-
graphic knowledge end abilities. Their development in trainees occurs more success-
fully with the use of appropriate training and visual aids and specific methods
techniques. We will become familiar with some of them.

Introduction:

The Suvorov military schools were formed in 1963. In the time of their existence
they have taught and indoctrinated thousands of young boys. who now have become
cadets. officers and generals. They are distinguished by ideological conviction.
devotion to the Communist Party and Soviet people. extensive and diversified knowl-
edge. high culture. and a desire to serve their Motherland and the cause of defend-
ing socialism selflessly.

During the period of school training Suvorov personnel receive firm. detailed
knowledge and acquire the necessary ideological-political. moral-combat and other
qualities needed by the future Soviet officer. The military educational institu-
tions where they continue studies take note of their high general educational train-
ing. political competency. social activeness. discipline. industriousness. interest
in the study of military disciplines. and enthusiasm for sports.

After coming to the Suvorov school following the eight-year school. the boys study
in it for two years. In this time they learn general educational subjects under
the secondary school curriculum and the foundations of Harxist-Leninist ethics and
esthetics. and they receive good physical development.

Much time in the schools is allocated for military training. and this is natural.
since the further destiny of Suvorov students is service in the rank of officer.
classes in military subjects are conducted in the classroom and in the field. In
accordance with the training program. Suvorov students practice the soldier's
actions in different kinds of combat. study models of small arms. familiarize them-
selves with the design of a vehicle. learn to drive itsndgain skills of operating
a radio. Many hours are set aside for drill training of Suvorov students. They
demonstrate their magnificent drill schooling in military parades in our Mother-
land's capital. Moscow. and in other cities of the country.

All this is related in the book "Suvorovskoye Voyennoye." The book's author P. A.
Buchenkov. now a reserve colonel and Honored Schoolteecher of the RSFSR. worked for
many years in one of the Suvorov military schools as an officer-indoctrinator,
instructor and senior instructor. He served a long while in the central apparatus
of the Ministry of Defense. where he handled matters involving the activity of
Suvorov military schools. For this reason he knowledgeably tells about the history
of the schools' development and their present day.

The author shows convincingly that all political indoctrination work performed in
Suvorov military schools is aimed at developing in Suvorov students utter dedica-
tion to the Communist Party. a feeling of Soviet patriotism and socialist

internationalisn. and a feeling of friendship of the peoples of our country. and at
developing in them a high awareness of social and military duty and love for the
mil itarp- service and the profession of Soviet officer. The baton of selfless serv-
ice to the homeland is passed from generation to generation. Heroic traditions of
the older generation are continued honorably by the present generation. As noted
in the CPSU Central Committee Report to the 26th party congress by CPSU CC General
Secretary, Comrade L. I. Brezhnev. "now it is the sons and grandsons of Great
Patriotic War heroes who stand in the ranks of the Motherland's defenders. They
did not go through the severe tests which fell to the lot of their fathers and
grandfathers, but they are true to the heroic traditions of our Arty and our
people." These words also can relate fully to the Suvorov students--future offi-
cers of the USSR Armed Forces.

In telling about the history of creation and the present day of Suvorov military
schools. the author refers in the book to documents which define their activity. He
shows the process of improving training and indoctrination work in then. gives the
names of generals. officers and employees who have made a considerable contribution
to the establishment and development of the schools and who continue to work in
them even today. and he introduces some former Suvorov students who are serving
successfully in the Armed Forces.

The book is addressed to all who are interested in military topics. who are engaged
in the military-patriotic indoctrination of the youth. as well as those who are
connected in one way or another with the work of Suvorov military schools. It can
be said confidently that pupils who are deciding an important question for them-
selves of “What shall I be?" also will refer to it. Familiarity with the work of
Suvorov military schools possibly will generate in some of them the desire to
obtain the officer's profession so as to dedicate their lives to service in the
ranks of our glorious Armed Forces, which stand on guard over the achievements of
the Great October and the building of comunism.

'lhe Pages of history

The Suvorov military schools were set up by decision of the Communist Party and
Soviet government in the menacing years of the Great Patriotic War. The Soviet
Motherland assumed responsibility for care of the children of its glorious defend-
ers. All steps were taken to ensure that the boys who put on the tunics with scar-
let shoulderboards became worthy successors and continuers of the glorious conbat
traditions of their fathers and of the older generations. The schools received
everything necessary for successful accoaplishment of the missions facing them:
experienced off leer-instructor personnel. well outfitted classrooms. textbooks and
library holdings.

Taking advantage of the experience of troops. military schools and other schools.
the comand element. indoctrinators and instructors of the Suvorov schools devel-
oped s system of military-patriotic indoctrination of Suvorov cadets which gave
them interest in the future ailitary profession. instilled discipline. execution
and a feeling of pride for our grand Armed Forces. and contributed to their devel-
opment of high moral qualities.

The schools covered a long path in search of form and methods for training and
indoctrinating Suvorov cadets and improving their preparation for further training

in military educational institutions of the Armed Forces and for Army service.
Let's follow this path.

Suvorov Traditions and a Search for New Things

In the early 1950's the Suvorov military schools already had taken shape as a new
type of military educational institution. The first graduations had been held.
Former Suvorov cadets were Completing military educational institutions and begin-
ning to serve in troop units. Senior supervisors and comrades in service watched
the lieutenants with “Suvorov mettle" closely. The officers and instructors of
Suvorov military schools also did not lose sight of their students and were con-
stantly asking how their service was going. They carefully analyzed responses
about their former students coming from troop units and drew conclusions as to
which traditions should be secured and developed and which path to take further,
and they sought new and more effective training and indoctrination methods.

The Soviet school took a path of exploration after the war and the Suvorov military
schools tried to adopt the school's foremost experience and develop it with con-
sideration of their own specific missions. Organizttional changes were taking
place in the schools: The principle of recruitment cnanged and the training period
was cut, initially to three years, then to two. The C( tent of training and
indoctrination work also changed. Tasks facing the schools became more difficult.
The transition to a two-year training term required the officer-instructors to
intensify the training and indoctrination process. Training and indoctrination
work had to be readjusted so that Suvorov cadets in two years received detailed and
firm knowledge in all subjects of the curriculum for the 9th and 10th grades and
corresponding training for further studies in higher military educational institu-
tions.

We Introduce the Schools

At the present time eight Suvorov military schools function in our country. As

before, the training and life of Suvorov cadets is organized in conformity with

military routine and with consideration of their age. They are placed together

lnto platoons and companies with officers as their commanders. School students

perform duties as squad commanders (and as deputy platoon commanders in the 10th
grades).

Suvorov cadets who have completed the school receive a secondary education certifi-
cate. They are issued a badge with the silhouette of A. V. Suvorov, which was
instituted in 1959 by order of the USSR Minister of Defense. The badge is a laurel
wreath. convex in shape. with a five-pointed gold star in its upper part. a has-
relief of A. V. Suvorov in the center. a red enameled shield with the inscription
"SVU" [Suvorov Military School] below. with the inscription "SSSR" covered with red
enamel above the bar. Today this badge is worn proudly by former Suvorov cadets.
from the school cadet to the general. It reminds them of the Suvorov years, of
their youth. and of the school which determined their life's career.

The statute on Suvorov military schools and Nakhimov naval schools establishes that
graduates of Suvorov military schools are sent for further training to military
educatlonal institutions of the USSR Armed Forces by the chiefs of the Suvorov
schools in conformity with an allocation approved by the Clc of the Ground Forces.
The level of the Suvorov cadets' general educational. military and physical train-
ing. their moral qualities. state of discipline and state of health are taken into
account in determining the school.

Classes are held in all Suvorov schools according to identical curricula and pro-
grams. The conditions for the Suvorov cadets' studies and living also are identi-
cal in them. Nevertheless. each school has its own aspect. its own features. and
is distinguished from another. This uniqueness is determined by many circum-
stances: individuality. uniqueness of the city in which it is located, traditions
which have formed over many years. and the names of their graduates who have taken
significant steps in their Army career. But ask any former Suvorov cadet which
Suvorov school is best in his opinion and he will name the one in which he studied
and which gave him a ticket to life.

The party has placed responsibility on the Soviet Armed Forces for reliable assur-
ance of peaceful conditions for the creative labor of our people. This responsi-
bility grew especially under conditions of the more complicated international situ-
ation where imperialist and other reactionary circles are making a furious counter-
sttack against detente. whipping up tensions in the world. accelerating the arms
race. fanning centers of military confrontation in various parts of the world. and
provoking new conflicts. In this situation the party is conducting a consistent
and firm policy of peace. combining it with a strengthening of the Soviet state's
defenses. The aggravation of the military-political situation in the world
increases the social responsibility of the Soviet Armed Forces for defending the
achievements of socialism and increases the demands on their codat readiness.

The 26th CPSU Congress noted that our party and the Soviet state have not lost
sight for a single day of questions of strengthening national defensive might and
the country's Armed Forces. The international situation made and is making this
mandatory. The combat potential of the Soviet Armed Forces was and is being main-
tained at a proper level with consideration of it.

The level of combat readiness of units and subunits depends largely on the organ-
izing role of officer cadres. their professional training and their ability to
adjust the process of training subordinates in conformity with modern requirements.
combining this process organically with the indoctrination of people. They have a
leading role to play in all the life and combat activities of the Armed Forces.
Following Lenin's behests. the Communist farty steadfastly concerns itself with
seeing that the Armed Forces have cadres worthy of the great Soviet land. The
Soviet officer must be distinguished above all by ideological conviction. utter
dedicationto the party and people. profound knowledge. high courage and valor. firm
will and good organizational abilities.

The foundations of high command and moral-combat qualities and skills are laid down
in schools. including the Suvorov schools. Tens of thousands of Suvorov cadets who
received a start in Army life are now serving successfully in troop units. They
hold various command and staff positions. they are political officers and military
engineers. they engage in scientific activites. they teach in military academies
and schools. and they serve in the Ministry of Defense central apparatus. Many
officers who are former Suvorov cadets have been recognized with high governmental

awards for courage and valor displayed in performing responsible command assign-
ments.

ho
CPSU CC Politburo hember. USSR .‘iinister of Defense liar SU D. F. Ustinov notes: "The
party shows great concern for Army and Navy personnel. believing that the individ-
ual has been and remains the decisive force in war. It attaches particular impor-
tance to training and indoctrinating Soviet officers. viewing them as carriers of
the Army's revolutionary. military spirit and its combat traditions and experience.
Military councils. commanders. political entities, party organizations and all
Armed Forces officers act as conductors of party policy in the Army and Navy.
Through them the CPSU exercises its influence on all aspects of troop life and
aetivities."

Officers can be seen today in all branches of the USSR Armed Forces who proudly

wear the badge with the silhouette of the great Russian general A. V. Suvorov. They
implement party policy firmly and consistently and are making a worthy contribution
to performance of missions assigned the USSR Armed Forces by the 26th CPSU Congress.

True to the grand heroic traditions of the older generations. today's officer
cadres are full of resolve to achieve new success in improving the quality of per-
sonnel combat and political training. the personnel's mastery of contemporary
equipment and weapons and a strengthening of military discipline; and in increasing
the cambat readiness of units. subunits and ships. In greeting the 26th CPSU Con-
gress. the USSR Armed Forces delegation assured the congress delegates that the
Army and Navy would continue to serve their people and the native party selflessly.
"Soldiers of the 1980's," states the greeting. "serve with lawful pride under the
colors steeped in the glory of legendary victories. And we report to you. dear
comrades, that Army and Navy combat traditions live and are multiplying. and that
the present generation of the Hotherland's defenders are demonstrating by their
daily labor a deep dedication to the native Leainist Party and a constant readiness
to defend the socialist homeland."

Capt Sergey Pavlovich Kozlov. a former Suvorov cadet. was among members of the USSR
Armed Forces delegation who greeted the party forum. And words coming from the
heart rang out in the greeting lnhis name: ". . . Comsndsra, political entities
and party organizations will continue to do everything to ensure that military serv-
ice conditions and indoctrinates Soviet boys in a spirit of deep understanding of
the responsibility for the prosperity and security of the socialist Hotherland...

"Let our enemies know that the formidable weapons which our Motherland presented us
are in reliable and capable hands. Hissilemen and motorized riflemen. tankers and
artillerymen. aviators and navy-en master first-rate equipment expertly, are per-
sistently learning to act in the most difficult cosbat situation and are ready to
offer a crushing rebuff to any aggressor.

"Al‘. Soviet soldiers from the private to the marshal assure the 26th Congress of
the Comunist Party of the Soviet Union. the native Leninist Party and the heroic
Soviet people that we always are on guard.

"Shoulder to shoulder with brothers in class-—soldiera of Warsaw Pact nations—we
will continue to perform our patriotic and international duty honorably and will
defend the historic achievements of socialism and peace against all encroachments."
