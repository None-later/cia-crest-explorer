FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUES STATEMENT 0N DRUGS
PA281756 Havana PRELA in Spanish 1617 GMT 28 Jan 82

Irext] Havana. 28 J n (PL)--The Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry has rejected
the U.S. effort to PrLa it Cuba as an accomplice in the international drug
traffic.

in a statement issues last night, the Foreign Relations Ministry declares that
Cuba has never given or sent arms to the Colombian guerrillas.

Here is a text of the Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry statement:

The U.S. State Department has just issued an official statement trying to link
Cuba with drug-traffickers to facilitate, allegedly, arms supplies to Latin
American guerrillas.

The State Department states: 'tuba facilitates the work of networks of
traffickers by allowing mother ships transporting marihuana to seek refuge
in Cuban waters while waiting for the arrival of transport boats from the
Bahamas and Florida." This is a lie that represents true infamy.

If there is drug-trafficking in America and if this is a profitable business.
it is because of the growing corruption in U.S. society. This corruption
has resulted in a continuous increase in the number of drug addicts at all
levels of society and in an unstoppable consumption of drugs.

The links between the "mafia." politics and the U.S. authorities is daily
exposed by the yankee news media, films and novels. It was the U.S. Senate,
and not an anti-imperialist center, which clearly established the agreements
made between the CIA and the mafia--with the encouragement and support of
".5. Government officials--to organize the assassination of chiefs of state
of the reg Inn .

If there is drug traffic. it is because in countries such as Colombia, the
planting, production and international sale of drugs annually produces
millions of dollars, a good share of which goes into the pockets of well-known
civilian and military authorities in those countries.

can: is the only lmtln American country that has been able to rid itself of
the spreading drug vice. Cuba is also free of the cultivation and sale of
drugs. No one would dare deny this fact.

No country of Latin America has fought harder. or with more energy and decisive-
ness than Cuba to prevent air and sea traffic of drugs to the United States.

Proof of this is that dozens of 0.8. and Latin American drug-traffickers have
served time in Cuban prisons. Those who did not complete their time or who
are not still in prison. were released because Cuba acceded to do this due

to humanitarian requests from important U.S. and latin American persons.

For this reason. we reject with indignation the ignoring of this fact and the
presenting of Cuba as an accomplice in the international traffic of drugs.

We also flatly reject the information that the State Department claims to have
According to which Mr Jaime Cuillot Lara "went to Cuba on two occasions since
October 198! and on his second visit received €7u0,000 from the Cuban Government
to buy arms for the Colombian 19 April Movement, K 19, guerrillas." This is.
absolutely, another lie. That person has never been in Cuba. He has not
received a single dollar from Cuba for any purpose.

We have stated that Cuba has never given or sent arms to the Colombian guerrillas
and we once again categorically reiterate this.

if the U.S. Government persists in this type of charges or in similar hostile
actions against our country. Cuba will find itself forced to cease all the

cooperation that it maintains with the United States in the struggle against
the traffic of drugs.

The truth is that our country has been some sort of gendarme in the Caribbean
against an international drug traffic that does not affect Cuba at all and
we are in no sense obligated to cooperate with the arrogant government of a
country that maintains a criminal economic embargo against our fatherland,
that illegally occupies a part of our national territory and that maintains

a continuous policy of hostility, aggression and threats against our people.

[Signed] Ministry of Foreign Relations.

ZOMNUNISTS PREDICT SOHBER ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
?A250100 Havana PRELA in Spanish 2314 GMT 24 Jan 82

[Text] Lima. 24 Jan (PL)--The Peruvian Communist Party (PCP) has predicted a
note somber economic panorama for 1982 and reiterated that the cause of the
Peruvian crisis lies in submission to the interests of transnational companies.

The PCP's statement on the eve of its special eight national congress that begins
on Thursday was released here in a document published in the weekly UNIDAD. from
its political commission.

The document stated that this year there will be a worsening of the general
economic situation with the elimination of subsidies. the increase of devaluations.
the sale of public enterprises and the closure of small and medium—sized factories.

I. also indicated that this policy will cause more unemployment and the reduction
at the people's already—decreasing purchasing power and consumption.

At the same time. it added. the government plans to neutralize the trade union
movement through an unfeasibie "policy of coordination" without a radical change
in its financial economic policy.

In this context. the document indicated that the signing of any pact of under-
standing with the government. as Prime Minister Manuel Ulloa Elias recently
proposed in a speech to the nation. is impossible.

AFivr indicating that uiloa's defense of the government's "achievements" do not
fit with reality. the document stated that the authorities are trying to evade
their responsibilities and are blaming their failure on the drop in mineral prices
on the international market. among other factors.

The real cause of this situation. it said. is the surrender of the minerals.
petroleum and other resources to the monopolies: and the suffocation of the
national sector and industry because of the lack of control over imports and high
interest ralos.

The PCP noted that production last year did not reach the announced 6 percent.
that inflation reached more than 70 percent and that industrial growth only reached
1.8 percent while there was a negative traoe balance and balance of payments.

The document stressed that 52.6 percent of this year's budget is allocated to the
payment of the public debt and military expenditures.

It also indicated that the increase in taxes and prices of fuel and the bigger

foreign debt will have effects on the consumers and will be one more burden on
their standard of living.

The PCP stated that the economic model of transnationalizntion and liberalization
on the economy has shown here. as in Chile. Argentina and other countries. that

it is not an optionforachieving development. Nevertheless. it added, Prime
Minister Ulloa affirms its concepts.

In contrast, the PCP proposed to the government that in order to overcome the
crisis it must undertake independent development, nationalize the petroleum and
mines and defend the important state sector.

It concluded by stating that this platform and the unity of the democratic and

popular forces will permit the defense of national interests and the unity of
the people around the establishment of a just and free society.

PA031924 Havana PRELA in English 1915 GMT 3 Jan 82

[Article by Dario Ibanez Fajardo]

[Text] Kingston, 4 Jan (PL)—-The "Progressive and Revolutionary Broad Front"
set up recently in Suriname announced that its vital goal will be to remove from
the country all vestiges of imperialist, neocolonialist and racist exploitation.

Dayse Boutcrse, leader of the front and head of the ruling Military Council, stated
in a message to the nation that "we will end the economic. political and cultural
subjection of our country to imperialism."

He added that the structures based on racism that served the neocolonial regime
will be destroyed and the foundations created of a new society that will guarantee
the rights and liberties achieved by the populace, especially the toiling masses.

Further on in his message the Suriname leader confirmed that a constituent assembly
will draw up a new constitution, in keeping with the national interests, to be
promulgated and take effect this year.

The Suriname Government, he stated, will accept technical, economic and financial
assistance from all countries that show they are prepared to do so without setting
political conditions.

Likewise, he declared that his country will join no military alliance nor will it
allow any military bases to be installed on its territory.

In regard to the front's foreign policy, Bouterse said it will be one of nonalign-
ment characterized by ongoing defense of peace and support for the national
liberation movements.

Finally, he announced that this year's activities will include reorganization of
the army to turn it into popular armed forces for the defense of the workers' gains.

The Broad Revolutionary Front proclaimed over 2 weeks ago is comprised of representa-

tives of the armed forces, political parties, unions, farmers and student organi-
zations of Suriname.
