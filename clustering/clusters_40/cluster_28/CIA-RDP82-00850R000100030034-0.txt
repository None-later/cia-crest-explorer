[Article by Capt-Lt A. Shcheglov: "0n the Ideologies]. Conditioning of
Cuban Soldiers"]

[Text] 0n 1 January 1979 the Cuban people celebrated its Liberation Day.
Twenty years ago its long years of struggle against American aonopolies
end the Batista dictatorship ended in victory. A new era in the life of

the country began -- an era' of revolutionary transforlstions and of the
construction of socialist.

The soldiers of the Revolutionary Arned Forces. the heirs of the heroic
past of their honelami, are vigilantly standing guard over the peaceful
labor of the Cuban people which is building aocialisa.

The development of the Revolutionary Arned Forces is being carried out
under the constant leadership of the Communist Party of Cuba. In the
decisions of the First Congress of the Comnisr. Party of Cuba it is
emphasized: "The party attributes and will continue to attribute
especial importance to strengthening the defense capacity of the country,
to naintaining the combat and mobilization readiness of the Revolutionary
Armed Forces, and to the active participation by the entire people in the

defense of our revolutionary gains and of the independence and sovereignty
of our country.“-

Political education work which influences all of the aspects of the life
and activities of the Revolutionary Araed Forces is assigned an important
place in the accomplish-eat of these tasks. Its prenises arose at the
time when under the revolutionary dictatorial regime the young revolution-
aries lead by Fidel Castro and his fellow fighters were preparing to give
battle to the Batista dictatorship. Underground workers explained the
goals and tasks of the novement to the young people who had taken the
revolutionary path and developed staunch fighters. Remembering those
days, the Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces General of the

Army Raul Castro has said: ”ln...the struggle against tyranny -
we did not forget about political training. Performing organizational
and propaganda work, we created circles in which, along with other
materials, Marxist literature was studied....we underwent a theoretical
training which included a study of the combat history of our people and

of thezpolitical ideas of the leaders of the revolutionary struggling
Cuba."

The importance of the egitational and propaganda work which was carried
out during that period is testified to by the high morale of the 165
fighters who on 26 July 1953 stormed the Honcado fortress in Santiago
de Cuba. Although the revolutionaries suffered a failure, their action

was of great political importance for the development of the revolutionary
process in Cuba.

In a speech at a Cuban-Soviet friendship nesting in Havana on 29 January
1974 the General Secretary of the CC CPSU and Chairman of the Presidium

of the Supreme Soviet USSR L. I. Brezhnev emphasized: “Today,.speaking
about the grand hours of Cuban history, we cannot but pay tribute to

the heroic standard bearers of your revolution. Under a severe dictatorial
regime a handful of fighters courageously joined battle against the
oppressora, fired the popular masses with their ideas and raised them to

a victorious struggle. This was truly a great feat.“3

At the beginning of the combat operations by the expedition of rebels
who landed from the yacht "Granma" on 2 December 1956, along with oral
propaganda, the newspaper EL CUIANO Link! began to be published and its
first editor was Ernesto Che Cuevera.

The radio also played an important role in propaganda on the territory
which had been liberated by the rebels. The first appearance on the air
by "Radio Rebelde" took place on 26 February 1958. The radio broadcast
information, bulletins on the military situation on the fronts, political
commentaries. discussions. explanations of the meaning and ideas of the
rebel movement, and reports about the repressions of the dictatorship.

Fidel Castro has emphasized that truthfulness was the basic principle of
radio propaganda. The broadcasts by this radio station were listened to
not only by the fighters of the rebel army and the inhabitants of the
liberated areas, but by the entire people of the island.

In view of the importance and necessity of training special cadres to
conduct ideological and educational work, in 1958 the first revolutionary
political instructors school was created for the rebel army in the
Sierra Maestra. During the war it conducted three recruitments and
trained two graduating classes; the third graduation took place after

the victory of the revolution in Santiago de Cuba.5 This school was

the first organized form of the training of political instructors who

played an important role in the educational and agitational-propsgsnda
work along the personnel of the revolutionary forces.

The basic task of the ideological and educational work was subordinated
to the attainment of the chief goal -» the rapid destruction of the
Batista forces and the overthrowal of the hated dictatorship. Along
with this. great attention was devoted to propaganda and agitation among
the personnel of the Batista forces. The purposes for which the rebels
were fighting were explained to the soldiers, the justness of their
cause and the corruptness of the Batista dictatorship were demonstrated.
and it was suggested to them that they make the only correct choice --
to stop shooting at their brothers and at their own people. and, by
uniting with them. to overthrow the rotten anti-popular system.

Toward these ends, the rebels conducted oral propaganda and radio broad-
casting. sent letters and leaflets to the camps of the units and subunits
of the government army, and performed explanatory work among prisoners.

The truthful words and the unmasking of the government's lies had a
positive influence on the soldiers of the Batista Army. During combat
operations hundreds of them voluntarily surrendered, while some of then
declared a desire to fight on the side or the rebels.

In the end, the combat operations of the revolutionaries, supported by
the broad popular masses of Cuba, ended in victory in January 1959. The
role of the rebel army in the historic events of its country was properly
evaluated by the First Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba. It is
stated in the summary report to the Congress that the "rebel army was
the soul of the revolution."6 with the establishment of people's power
in the country the revolutionary government devoted great attention to
the construction of the armed forces. This was extremely necessary.
American imperialism was doing everything it could to strangle the Cuban
Revolution. First it declared an economic blockade, and then it went
over to direct aggressive acts against Cuba. Raul Castro has emphasized:
'"rhe situation demanded of us that we create a mgdern arny capable of
standing against new and more powerful enemies.”

In October 1959 the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces wns formed.
Detachments of people's militia began to be formed. In the middle of 1961
the first regular units of the Revolutionary Armed Forces were created.

As Cuba developed in its socialist path its cooperation with the socialist
countries became stronger and wider. Cuba's international positions.

its interests, and its security were increasingly protected not only by
the fire policy of the Communist Party of Cuba and the heroism of its
people, but also by the support of the USSR and other socialist countries.
The Revolutionary Armed forces of Cuba -- a reliable defender of the
people's socialist gains - were created and equipped with help iron the
USSR and socialist countries.8

The Cuban people place a high value on the Soviet Union's contribution
to strengthening the defense capacity of the Island of Freedom "Decisive
military assistance was given to us by the great homeland of Lenin."

it was noted at the First Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba. "which
from the first. most difficult momenta of our revolution provided Cuba
with modern means of defense free of charge. The Soviet Union provided
us with valuable assistance through its military specialists who taught
us how to use weapons, gave us their knowledge of modern military science.
and served as an example of modesty, selflessness. and a Couunist
attitude to life."9 The adoption on 26 November 1963 of a universal
military service law was an important event in the further strengthening
of Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces and in increasing their combat
readiness.

During the course of the construction of the Revolutionary Armed Forces

a great deal of attention was devoted to political education work. "During
the period of the creation of our units," Fidel Castro has said, "and of
increasing our combat readiness and strengthening discipline political
work has been one of the most important jobs and. one might say, that this
work is the most important work.“10

In order to strengthen: educational and mass cultural work in 1959 a
department of culture was created in the Revolutionary Armed Forces. This
is the period of the opening of the Frank Pair School for the training

of Political Educators. Along with the revolutionary education of the
servicemen, one of the most important tasks of its graduates has been the
elimination of illiteracy. (as of 1 January 1959 80 percent of the fighters
in the rebel army were illiterate).11

In 1960 the work on revolutionary education and the elimination of
illiteracy in the army was headed by Ernesto Che Guevera. On his
initiative, a weekly military magazine VERDE OLIVO began to be published.”
Che Guevara activated political training for the personnel and took active
part in preparing the first textbook for political studies. In 1961 the
Osvaldo Sanchez School for Political Instructors was opened. In that year

it graduated its first 756 political instructors who were assigned to the
armed forces. -

During that period the Administration for Revolutionary Education of General
headquarters carried out the immediate leadership of ideological and
political and educational work in the armed forces. Political education
sections were created in the branches of the armed forces and in the

armies, while in the divisions revolutionary education groups were

created. Political instructors were appointed in battalions and companies.
In addition to combat training. political training for the personnel was
introduced into the Revolutionary Armed Forces.

0n 2 December 1963 party organizations began to be created in the units
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. The formation of party organizations
fostered a strengthening of the army's might, a rise in the revolutionary
consciousness and morale ”of the soldiers and officers, and an improvement
of combat training. By the and of 1966 party organisations had been
created in all of the units (ships) of the Revolutionary Armed Forces.

All of the ideological work in the Cuban Army is carried out on the basis
of the decisions of the First Party Congress, the Program Platform and
Charter of the Cot-aunist Party of Cuba, the decree of the plenuss of the
CC and Politburo, the orders and directives of the Comander-in-Chief and
Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, and the instructions of the

chief of the Central Political Administration of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces.

Political agencies have been created in all of the branches of the armed

forces. formations, units, military educational institutions, and
institutions.

The political agencies direct all of the ideological and political work
toward cultivating high morale-political and fighting qualities in the
soldiers, raising the level of combat training and maintaining the

combat readiness of the tr00ps, strengthening conscious military discipline
and the principle of one-Inn leadership, and also toward the accomplish-
ment of the concrete tasks which are set for the units and subunits of

the Revolutionary Armed Forces. The Communists of the army are the active

conductors of the policy of the Communist Party of Cuba in the Revolution-
ary Armed Forces.

"The party's work in the ranks of the armed forces," the First Congress
of the Communist Party of Cuba emphasized, "contributed to the fact that
their party organizations achieved a high level of maturity and develop-
ment as a result of a systematic study from the moment of their forma-

tion of Marxist Leninist theory, a strengthening of party organizational

work, air; a constant improvement of the quality of the conposition of their
ranks."

As of December 1976 86 percent of the officers in the Revolutionary Armed
Forces were members of the party and the Union of Young Conunists.“

The members of the Union of Young Conunists - the organization of the
advanced youth and a smithy of the party's fighting reserve - are active
helpers of the party in the Revolutionary Armed Forces.

The army organizations of the Cuban komsomol give their basic attention
to raising the political and general educational level of the members
of the Union of Young Columnists and of all of the soldiers and to a

deep study by them of Harxist-bsninist theory. They struggle for
exemplary behavior by all of the masbsrs of the Union in carrying out
their military service and also conduct work with the non-union youth,
and so forth. More than 50,000 soldiers joined the Union of Young
Conuniets during their service in the Revolutionary Armed Forces, and

after having gone into the reserve they worked successfully in the
economy.15

The cornsnders, political agencies, and party and youth organizations
attribute great importance to developing and increasing the effectiveness
of socialist competitions. They are organized between soldiers, tank
crews, gun crews, squads, platoons. companies, and battalions. Since
1972 the victors in socialist competitions have been presented with

the insignia "Outstanding Member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces."

The servicemen of the Air Defense, Air Force, and Revolutionary Navy
have achieved great successes in socialist competition. For the first
time in Cuba two units of the Air Defense and Air Force and one unit

of the Revolutionary Navy have been awarded the honorary designation of
Guard Units.

The basic forms of the ideological work which is conducted in the
Revolutionary Armed Forces are Harxist-Leninist training for officers,
political classes for sergeants and the rank-and-file, party education,
and agitational-‘propaganda and mass cultural work.

The materials of the First Congress of the Comunist Party of Cuba, the
Program Platform of the Co-unist Party of Cuba, and the Constitution of
the Republic of Cuba are studied in the Harrist-Leninist studies of the
officers and in the political classes of the sergeants and the rank-and-
file. The Cuban soldiers increase their knowledge about the history of
Cuba and study the experience of socialist construction in the USSR and
other fraternal countries. Thus, for example, in 1978 in the Marxist-
Leninist training system the officers studied such problems as Marxism-o
Leninism on war and the army and the political economy of socialism; the
soldiers and sergeants work on such topics as "The Cat-mist Party of
Cuba." "'lhe Third Congress of the Union of Young Communists and Its Basic
Decisions," "The World Socialist System," and so forth.

One of the most important tasks in the ideological work which is performed
in the Revolutionary Armed Forces is the education of Cuban soldiers in a
spirit of patriotism and proletarian internationalism.

The heroic accomplishments of the Cuban people are described by exhibits
in the Central house of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, the military ‘
glory museums, the "V. I. Lenin-J. Marti" rooms, and unit clubs. Year
after year the relationships and contacts between the Armed Forces of

the USSR and of Cubn grow stronger. Mutual visits by delegations for

the purpose of exchanging experience on the organization of cuhat training
and the ideological and political conditioning of soldiers have hecoae
systenatic.

The developnent of contacts with the Revolutionary Araed Forces and the
USSR's ailitary aid to Cuba are helping to defend the .ains of the
Cuban Revolution. "It is known that the Soviet Union is also providing

aid to Cuba in strengthening its defense.” L. l. Brezhnev esphasited at
the Cuban-Soviet friendship nesting in havens. "We know very well, as.
probably. others also know: Soviet weapons in the handn of Cubans are
not weapons for attacking anybody. and not a leans of aggravating the
international situation. They serve the just cause of defending the
revolutionary gains of your people. the cause of peace and calm”6

The relationships betuesythe Revolutionary Arned Forces of Cuba and
the other araies of the socialist co-onwealth countries are also
growing stronger and developing.

More than two decades have passed since the Revolutionary Araed Forces
of Cuba were born. Today it is a sodern any which occupies a worthy
place in the fighting ranks of the arsed forces of the countries of the
socialist co-onweslth. .
