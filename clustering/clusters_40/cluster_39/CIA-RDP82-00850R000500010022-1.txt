[Annotatiom foreword and table of contents from book "Manual for the
Design of Ships with Dynamic Principles of Support” by Boris Aleksandrovich

Kolyzayev, Anatoliy Ivanovich Kosorukov and Vladilen Aleksandrovich Litvinenko.
Izdatel'stvo "Sudostroyeniye", 4000 copies, 472 pages]

[Text] Fundamental information on the theory and practice of designing hydrofoil
and air-cushion ships (SPK and SVP) is systematized. Methods are proposed for de-
termining the principal dimensions of these ships, their propulsive and seakeepim
qualities. and their economic characteristics. Methods of optimizing a design

solution are indicated and an analysis is given of errors in calculating the basic
characteristics of SPK and SVP. The principles for prescribing design mrgins are

substantiated. Questions on the reliability and safety of these ships are eluci-
dated.

The manual is intended for engineers and shipbuilders, specialists of NH [Scien-
tific Research Institutes], 103 [design bureaus] of shipbuilding enterprises and of
the fleet. It may be used by graduate students and students of the senior courses
of higher educational establislnents and schools of shipbuilding.

Forevord. Ships with dynamic principles of support (SDPP); namely, 31’! and SW
are winning widespread acceptance as ‘convenient and profitable means of fast trans-
portation.

To further perfect SPK and SW, to improve their seakeeping qualities and increase
prof itableness. research has been conducted over many years. In recent years works
have appeared which were devoted to the hydrodynamics of hydrofoils, the aerody-
namics of air cushions, the theory and practice of designing propulsors, the de-

scription of the power plants (EU) of SD”, general and local strength, structural
materials, and the analysis of experience in operating SDPP.

Among recent works, there is great interest in the books of I. ‘1'. Yegorov, N. A.
Zaytsev, c. P. Zlobin, I. I. Isayev, N. V. Hattes, Yu. A. Netsvetayev, A. A.

Rusetskiy, Yu. H. Sadovnikov, V. T. Sokolov, A. N. Kholodilin, A. N. Shmyrev and
others.

In the development of the theory of SW, great contributions were mde by Yu. Yu.
Benua, A. N. Bagno, K. P. Vashkevich, A. D. Volkov, V. K. D'yachenko, G. P. Zlobin,
V. K. Zoroastrov, T. A. Zaytsev, V. V. Klichko, B. P. Kuzovenkov, I. A. Lyubomirov,
V. A. Lukashevskiy, Ye. Z. Novikov, I. V. Ozimov, V. N. Puzyrev, S. D. Prokhorov,
A. A. Meetskiy, V. N. Treshchevskiy, V. I. Khonzhonkov, V. P. Shadrin, V. V.
Shatalov, V. A. Tsarev and others.. 0f works, however, embracing comprehensively
all the knotty problems of designing SPK and SVP, there is a total insufficiency.

The book by the authors of this manual, "Features of the Design of Ships Hith New
Principles of Support”, which came out in 1976, because of an insufficient printing
of copies became a bibliographic rarity and could not satisfy the inquiries of
engineers and shipbuilders, teachers, graduate and undergraduate students special-
izing in the area of the theory of the design of ships. The text book of A. H.
Vaganov, "The Design of Fast Ships”, published in 1978, is a useful contribution
to educational literature, but it does not cover the basic questions in the design
of SPK and SVP sufficiently completely.

The manual being offered for the attention of readers makes up for the deficiency
of literature on the general design of SDPP. The amount of material necessary for
exploratory design studies is systematized in the book,fulfilling in the process
the formation of the conception of the ship and the substantiation of the design
proposal. In addition to general methods of design, recounendations are given for
the formation of the function of social usefulness, for the technical and ecmomic
basis of an optiml solution, and for the design of the hydrodynamic systems, the
aerodynamics of the air cushion, propulsors, and for the determination of the ex-
ternal forces, the stresses acting in the mu, hydrofoils, and the flexible en-
closures. Recoumendations on the choice of the type of power plant are given and
specific numerical examples.

In many cases several formlas are presented for the determination of the same
quantity. This was done on purpose. Basically, it does not work out well to give
preference to any one forums when the accuracy of several of then is approximtely
the same. In this case, the designer, in accordance with the problems before him
and an amount of initial information, can select independently from those presented
the most convenient formla, or compute the sought after quantity as the average
from several formalas. The formlas and charts are based on both theoretical de-

velopments and on statistically processed data from many sources. Reference data
on SPKs and SVPs are presented.

The min attention was given to the choice of the general type, the principal di-
mensions, and the fundamental characteristics of an 80?? at the beginning of design
when the fundamental properties of the ship are being defined,such as seakeeping

ability, economy and others which remain essentially unchanged in the later design
stages.

In the first stages of design, it is not always possible to give preference to

any one type of SDPP. In a number of cases, a design is developed in several vari-
ants and only comprehensive, objective evaluation permits making a final choice

for the further direction of the work. This is why it is advisable to combine in
one book, data for the design of SP! and SVP.

The book has two parts. Part I is devoted to the design of SPK, and part II to
the design of SVP. Part I was written by A. I. Kosorukov. Part II, (chapters I
and II)were written by B.A. Kolyzayev. Part II, (chapters V, VI, VII, and section
6 of chapter III) were written by V. A. Litvinenko. Part II, (chapter III, sections
5 and 7 of chapter IV and section 20 of chapter VI) were written by S. A. Smirnov
who also assembled the material on SVP of the skeg type presented in chapter II.

The reconnendations adopted by the Assembly of the International Maritime Consul-
tative Organization (IHKO) and of the Code, which was coming into effect in 1979.,

on The Safety of Ships with Dynamic Systems of Support and which have an influence
on the characteristics of a ship, are reflected in the manual.

The principal characteristics of 8m and SVPs of foreign construction are pre-
sented in tables, charts, text, and drawings taken from foreign periodicals.

The book was written on the basis of the results of investigations carried out by

the authors, and on the correlation of data presented in domestic and foreign
literature.

The authors convey their thanks to the reviewers, candidates of technical sciences
V. K. D'yachenko and B. A. Tsarev for valuable cements and recomnendations di-
rected toward improving the book. The authors also consider it necessary to ex-
press their gratitude to 1.. V. Ozimov, I. V. Ozimov, Ye. Z. Novikov, T. N. Belyayev,
Yu. H. Hokhov, A. N. Dagno, Ye. G. Finkel'shteyn, V. K. Zoroastrov, and G. D.
Baranov. whose materials and reconnendations were used in writing the book.

The authors will gratefully receive cements about the contents of the annual di-

rected to the address of the publisher, Sudostroyeniye, 191065 Leningrad, Ulitsa

A new branch of powcr-cngineering—nuclcar-—has made an enormous leap in its devel-
opment in a comparatively short time (a little more .than a quarter of a century).
The electrical power of the First AES, which was started up on 21 June 1954 in
Obninsk, Kaluzhskaya Oblast, was about 5,000 kw. At present the installed capacity
of the world's nuclear electric-power stations is about 150 million kw. This rapid
development of nuclear power was occasioned primarily by the limited nature of fos-
sil-fuel reserves and the unevenness of their distribution about the globe. More-
over, during AES operation. pollution of the air basin with the sulfur compounds
and various combustion products that are discharged in large quantities by power
stations that operate on fossil fuels is precluded.

"...Today, throughout the whole world, power plants are discharging into the atmos-
phere annually 200-250 million tons of ash and about 60 million tons of sulfur
dioxide. In the long term. prior to the year 2000. these discharges can grow. re-
spectively, to 1.5 billion and 400 million tons. But nuclear power stations do not
need oxygen and do not contaminate the atmosphere with ash. sulfur and other com-
bustion products. These are 'cleaner' stations...."*

During the 10th Five-Year Plan a major step was taken toward the construction of
AES's. New capacity was introduced at the Kurskaya. Chernobyl'skaya, Lenin—
grad, Beloyarskaya. Novovoronezhskaya, Armyanskaya, Rovenskaya and Bilibinskaya
AES's. The erection of‘ large power units is in the completion stage at the Smo-
lenskaya, Yuzhno-Ukrainskaya and Kol'skaya AES's.

At the end of 1980 the total power of the USSR's nuclear power stations had
reached 12.5 million kw.

The generation of electricity at AES's is constantly increasing. Thus. in 1980
alone, the country's nuclear power stations produced 73 billion kw-hr of electrici-
ty. This is more electricity than was generated at AES's during all the years of

the Ninth Five-Year Plan. During the period 1976-1980, more than 230 billion kw-hr
were generated at M-ZS's.

During the 10th Five-Year Plan the erection of prototype power units with WEB-1000
and sN-ooo reactors was completed. The startup and mastery in 1980 of the v unit with a
vvsa-iooo reactor at the Novovoronezhskaya AES enabled conversion to the intense
construction of a large series of power units with unified WEE-1000 reactors. Ex-
perience in the erection and start of the III unit with Bil-600 reactor at the
Beloyarskaya AES is of enormous significance for the further acceleration of the
construction of nuclear power stations with breeder reactors.

Analyses are now being made of reactor installations with an [breeder] installa-
tions with sodium coolant, with a single-unit electricity power of 800 .000 and
1.6 million kw.

During the 11th Five-Year Plan. in accordance with 26th CPSU Congress decisions.
the pace of introduction of new capacity at AEs's will almost double in comparison
with the preceding five-year plan. In 1981-1985 new power units will go into
operation at the Kalininskaya, Zaporozhskaya, Rovenskaya. Khmel'nitskaya. Yuzhno-
Ukrainskaya, Rostovskaya and Balakovskaya AES's with wan-woo reactors. New power
units with Rana-woo reactors will be introduced at the Kurskaya, Smolenskaya.
Chernobyl'skaya and other AES's, and also at the Ignalinskaya ABS with ERIK-1500
reactors. All this will enable the generation of electricity at AES's to increase
still more and to be brought up to at least 15 percent of all the country's genera-
tion of electricity by the end of 1985.

In the next few years most AES's will operate at the base-load regime. -In this
case, the largest possible amount of secondary fuel--plutonium. which is necessary
for supporting the fuel cycle for the next stage of development, which will be
based on nuclear power stations with breeder reactors—will be turned out.

The nuclear power stations that are operating in the USSR demonstrate reliable and
safe operation. However, the increase in their number and their siting in regions
of high population density require that society give serious attention to ques-
tions of ABS safety.

Questions of the reliability and safety of ABS operation require paramOunt atten-
tion. AHS designs therefore call for a set of protective. localizing and other
arrangements and systems for averting major accidents, as well as measures that
preclude the release of radioactive substances outside the A55.

The wide construction of AES's requires reliable and, what is very important, eco-
nomical solution of the problems of processing and the later burial of radioactive

wastes.

CALCULATING COMPRESSION 0F DT-HIXTURE BY ELBCTRICALLY IMPLODED CYLINDRICLs SHELL

Novosibirsk ZHURNAL PRIKLADNOY HERBANIKI I TEKHNICHESKOY PIZIKI in Runninn No 6,
Nov-Dec 80 (manuscript received 8 Oct 79) pp 3-10

[Article by V. I. Afonin. Yu. D. Bakulin and A. V. Luchinskiy. Chelyabinsk. Tomsk]

[Text] One way to solve the problem of controlled nuclear fusion is to heat a
target containing a DT mixture as it is compressed by a dense shell accelerated

to velocities of the order of 107 cm/a or more [Ref. 1]. One of the ways to do
this is by using megagauss magnetic fields [Ref. 2]. An attractive feature of
this technique is the capability of getting a comparatively high (211) coefficient
of transfer of initially stored energy to the shell. In this process. kinetic
energy is picked up both due to magnetic field pressure. and due to dispersal of
matter from the surface of the shell. Both mechanisms of acceleration operate

in electric implosion of the shell by an intense current pulse. Ref. 3 gives the
calculation of electric implosion of a thin cylindrical shell when a megajoule
capacitor bank is discharged across it. The calculation yields compression rates
of up to 3'107 cm/s; however. because of the comparatively slew rates of increase
in current provided by capacitor banks, it is necessary to take a very low initial
relative thickness of the shell of ~10". The heating of the gas filling the shell
and the conditions of the fusion reactions were not considered in Ref. 3.

Ref. 4 gives the results of numerical calculation of compression and thermonuclear
ignition of a DT mixture as it is compressed by a cylindrical shell. It is found
in the calculations that combustion of deuterium-tritium with positive energy yield
is possible when a constant power of 23 10:" H is released in the shell. Although
it is pointed out that an electrodynamic method can be used for releasing such
power. the matter is not pursued further. nor are magnetohydrodynamic effects in

the shell and plasma considered.

Our paper is an attempt at a computational evaluation of feasibility of attaining
nuclear fusion by electric implosion of a shell. Consideration is taken of processes

in the electric circuit of the facility. magnetohydrodynamic processes in the target.
and the caurse of fusion reactions. Compression of the shell is taken as ideally

symmetric. Problems of the stability of compression [Ref. 5] are not considered
in this paper.

An analysis was made in Ref. 6 of electrophysical facilities from the standpoint
of their capabilities for setting up energy densities of the order of megajoules

per gram in a wire upon electric explosion. It was shown that such a capability
can be realized if lines connected in parallel with distributed parameters are
discharged into a load in the shape of a cylindrical shell. Therefore in the fol-
lowing we will limit ourselves to consideration of electric explosion of copper
cylindrical shells located in the center of a disk collector to which a system

of lines is connected in parallel.

To describe electric explosion of a cylindrical shell. we have used a system of
one-dimensional equations of magnetogasdynamics (H60) with thermal conductivity.
where the latter is accounted for in the diffusion approximation. The coefficient
of thermal conductivity was taken as proportional to the 5/2 power of temperature.
1. e. it was assumed that heat is transferred by electrons. It there was gas inside
the shell. the energy of bremsstrahlung arising upon compression of this gas did

not return to the shell. but was extracted from the load by the appropriate heat

sink function. The energy of alpha particles of thermonuclear origin absorbed
in the gas was also disregarded.

As in Ref. 7 in calculations of processes in copper. we used an interpolation equa-
tion of state (Ref. 8] describing the vaporization of copper and the region of

the vapor-liquid mixture. The way that electrical conductivity of copper depends
on density and thermal energy was also described as in Ref. 7. In the temperature
region up to a few electron-volts and at densities greater than 0.1 g/cm’. the
electrical conductivity was selected on the basis of experiments on electric explo-
sion of wires. In the region of densities lower than 0.01 g/cm3 and temperatures
of 10-100 eV. the data on electrical conductivity were taken from Ref. 9. where
they were calculated from the Saha and Boltzmann equations with consideration of
shielding. In a certain region of states of copper. electric conductivity was
interpolated between calculated experimental values and data of Ref. 9. and in
isolated cases was even extrapolated to temperatures greater than those considered
in Ref. 9. Naturally. the accuracy of interpolation and extrapolation requires
experimental verification. However. calculations show that such states of copper
are reached only in the last phases of compression. and errors in the description
of electrical conductivity even by two orders of magnitude do not cause any appre-
cialbe change in the compression process. The equation of state of an ideal gas
with y- 5/3 was used in calculating gases of D2 or UT enclosed in a shell. 0n

the other hand, if the DT mixture was frozen. it was taken into consideration with
the following equation of state:

with the experimental data given in Ref. 10. the constants in this equation of

The gas compressed inside the shell was taken as conductive. In this assumption,
consideration was taken of heating of the gas bath due to the work done by the
shell. and due to joule heat released during passage of current. The electrical
conductivity of the gas was determined from formulas of electrical conductivity
of completely ionized hydrogen plasma from Ref. 11. The possibility of ariaal
of individual channels of electric breakdown was disregarded in the calculations.

The system of HGD equations for calculating the load was solved on a computer to-
gether with the system of equations of the electric circuit. Line length and storage
of energy in the lines were determined after completing calculation of the process
based on its time. The collector of the facility was treated as a disk line with
wave impedance depending on radius.

If the time of wave propagation through the collector is much less than the time

of wave propagation through the main lines. then the current in the line-collector-
losd system (at constant load resistance R1) varies exponentially from a value

of Uo/(Rciﬂz) to Uo/(Rzi-Ro). where U. is the voltage to which the lines are charged.
R9 is the wave impedance of the coaxial line system, RC is the circuit resistance,

1. e. the sum of R0 and the collector resistance. Therefore a fairly good approxi-
mation of the equivalent circuit of the facility is that shown in Fig. l, where

Req is taken as

Req‘Ro+(Rc‘Ro)e-lho

where 1 is the time of wave passage through the collector.

A series of calculations has confirmed the validity of the relations derived in
Ref. 6. H60 calculations showed that dependence of the rate of acceleration-of
the inploding copper shell and the energy input on voltage U. is comparatively
weak. With an increase in 00 from 0.75 to 2 UV. there is a slight reduction in
the time of collapse of the shell and an increase in energy input. A further in-
crease in Ho has practically no effect on these quantities. but apparently should
lead to complication of the construction of the facility. A reduction of R0 in-
creases the rate of current rise in the load, and hence also increases the rate
of energy input. The latter is a decisive factor in achieving nuclear fusion.
Unfortunately there is a limit below which no change in R. can increase the rate
of energy input. This limit is the load resistance R; that begins to determine

the rate of energy input to the conductor at 3.01;. Nor does it make any sense
to reduce Ro below R; from the standpoint of energy expenditures. since the energy
stored in the lines at fixed 00 and process time o is inversely proportional to
R0. and the process of energy input is determined by the quantity R1.

R; can be reduced only by either reducing the length of the cylindrical conductor,
or by increasing its radius. of particular significance for the process is an
increase in the radius of the shell. Such an increase leads to an increase in
acceleration (due to an increase in the rate of current rise) as the shell is ac-
celerated by the magnetic field;

to an increase in the base of acceleration of the shell (as mass remains constant);
to an abrupt increase in the maximum velocity of dispersal of the shell (due to

the first two factors); to a reduction of heat losses in the gas (due to a reduc-
tion in the time of compression). The aggregate of these factors produces a sharply
nonlinear rise of maximum temperature of the compressed gas with increasing radius
and decreasing relative thickness of the copper shell.

The calculations showed that with other parameters fixed. the maximum temperature
of the compressed gas is most significantly dependent on its initial density Do-

To get temperatures in the gas of the order of several keV necessary for the be-
ginning of a thermonuclear reaction. the conductor must be filled with gas at pres-
sure of the order of atmospheric or less. 1. e. 9.50.0002. An increase in p. by
two orders of magnitude led to nearly cold compression of the gas. '

The results of calculations show that the length of the lines can be taken such
that the double time of wave transmission through the lines is somewhat less than
the time of shell compression. In this case. the second part (in time) of the
process takes place with somewhat lower voltage across the lines. but this has
little effect on the final result since most of the energy consumed by the load
is already in its magnetic field.

These research calculations were not intended to optimize the load on any given
facility. The main purpose of the calculations was to determine the laws governing
the process of compression of matter in electric implosion of a cylindrical shell.
and to demonstrate the feasibility of this method from the standpoint of achieving
nuclear fusion. Several variants of calculations of various systems are given

below.

Variant l. A copper shell with length of 1 cm and thickness of 0.01 cm and with
outside radius of r"- 1.25 cm is filled with a gaseous DT mixture with initial
den.ity 90- 3'10“5 g/cm’. The shell is connected through a collector to a system
of lines charged to Do- 2 HV with total wave impedance of {lo-0.005 9.

Preliminary calculation showed that maximum compression of the gas occurs at
t-r0.33 us. On this basis, the length of the lines was taken as equal to 280 cm.
which corresponds to energy storage of 36 NJ. At time t- 0.17 us. the voltage
across the lines had fallen to 1.8 NV. The calculation showed that the maximum

velocity of the shell was reached at its inside boundary. being 20 cm/us. Pig. 2

and gas system as shown in Fig. 3 refer to the instant near the time of maximum

gas compression. Temperature and density are nearly constant in the gas. Since
the thermal conductivity in copper falls sharply with increasing density, the high
density peak near the inside boundary of the copper abruptly reduces the heat trans-
fer from the gas. This explains the rapid drop in temperature in the narrow layer
of copper adjacent to the boundary. The quantity r, on Fig. 2 denotes the position
of the interface between gas and shell.

The energy transferred to the shell and gas was 10 and 0.06 “J respectively. Maxi-
mum energy in the shell was 20 MJ/g. The neutron yield of the system was 6-10"7
neutrons. and the energy of the alpha particles absorbed in the gas was three times
the energy of the gas transferred to it by the shell. However. we cannot expect
any intense thermonuclear flare here [see Ref. 12] as the naiimun I 9 (It in the

gas was 0.03 g/cm2.

Variant 2. The mass is reduced in the copper shell as compared with variant 1.
Its outside radius is increased to 2 cm with shell thickness of 0.001 cm. and the
length of the shell remains 1 cm. Inside the shell to a radius of 0.17 is 171' gas
with density of 10" g/cm’. surrounded by a frozen layer of DT (0.17<r<0.2) with
density of 0.2 g/cm’. Between this layer and the shell is a gap filled with gas
of low density p- 2-10" g/cm’. The voltage across the lines was taken as 2 NV
and the wave impedance of the lines was Ito-0.0075 9. At time t-0.l35 us the
voltage had fallen to 1.71 W. *

Fig. b shows time dependences of the outside :-H and inside r. radii of the shell.
and also of the outside rK and inside r, radii of the frozen at layer. After im-
pact of the shell along the DT layer, the velocity of their interface was 37 cm/us.
and the inner surface of the layer was accelerated to 42 cm/us. Within 3 ns after
impact the gas is compressed to r,- 10.3.10's cm. and its average temperature rises
to 8.5 Rev. A little previous to this instant the temperature and density in the
or layer have the profiles shown in Pig. 5. He note that within 0.4 ns the DT

layer is compressed, the profiles in the layer are equalized. and the average values
of temperature and density are 0.6 keV and 40 g/cm’. 0f the 21 NJ originally stored
in the lines. 7 and 1 NJ respectively are transferred to the shell and the UT.

The maximum values of the internal energy in the copper close to its inner boundary
reach 70 HJ/g. The energy of the alpha particles absorbed in the gas was 7 times
the energy from compression of the gas by the shell, the quantity Io dr was 0.4 g/cm’
and the neutron yield was of the order of 10", half of this amount falling to

the DT gas. and the other half to the initially frozen DT layer.

Variant 3. 01‘ gas with density ”-0.07 g/cm’ is enclosed in a copper cylindrical
shell 0.012 cm thick with outside radius r..- 1.2 cm. Length of the shell is 3 cm.
A system of lines with voltage U.‘ 2 11V and wave impedance Ila-0.03 ﬂ is discharged
across the shell. The problem was considered to ascertain the consequences of
compressing a gas of high initial density.

The compression process took place comparatively slowly: rate of dispersal of
the shell did not exceed 4 cm/us. Maximum compression was only 220. The gas was
practically unheated. By the instant of maxim. compression the gas was a thin
column of high-density cold matter. The quantity Io dr rose to 0.92 g/cm’. Shown
on Fig. 6 are graphs of the time dependence of the outer r" and inner r3 radii

of the shell and the quantity Io dr. Calculation shows that of the 26 NJ of initial
energy. 21 NJ is transferred to the she11+ gas system. of this energy. 4.2 HJ

make up the energy of the shell, 3.5 HJ comprise the energy of the gas, and the
remainder is in the magnetic field of the system. It should be noted that the
required initial energy store in the lines is appreciably dependent on the maximm
value of In dr. For example, only 12 FL] of the initial energy store is needed

to get a value of 0.67 for this quantity.

One thing that all calculations have in comon is that when the impedances of the
load and lines are sufficiently well matched. a large percentage of the energy

stored in the lines is transferred to the load and its magnetic field. In calcu-
lation of one system with energy store of 2.5 "J. this fraction came to more than
90!, the load energy proper exceeding 301 of this store. Let us note that for

this system we cannot expect self-heating of the gas due to a thermonuclear reaction;
however. the neutron yield found in the reaction was rather high: ~10”.

It is interesting to note a characteristic feature of gas compression with electric
implosion of a shell that is associated with the change in distribution of conduc-
tivity in the conductor during the process of electric implosion. 1n the initial
stage. due to the skin effect the maximum current density falls to the region of

the conductor that is adjacent to its outside boundary. The magnetic field prevents
outward dispersal of the conductor; however. a slight density reduction and the
contribution of joule heat still reSult in a drop in conductivity of the outer

part of the conductor by about two orders of magnitude. This intensifies the pro-
cess of penetration of the magnetic field and maximal: current density into the
conductor. The magnetic field approaches the inner boundary of the copper shell
with a large gradient. A rapid rise in magnetic and hydrodynamic pressures (due

to high current density and release of joule heat) causes abrupt acceleration and
load relief of the inside part of the shell. The gas with low density and pressure
located inside the shell does not hold back this pressure. As the density of the
inner part of the conductor drops, its conductivity decreases and becomes mini-m
(with respect to the cross section). The current density curve drops sharply with
decreasing radius. Contributing to this behavior is the distribution of density
(and accordingly of conductivity) that is set up in the shell, falling off from

the outer boundary toward the inner boundary. From about this moment. the inner
layers of the shell continue to travel by inertia, while the outer layers, and gradu~
ally the entire mass of the shell begin to be accelerated by the magnetic field.
This process continues until the inner layers begin to decelerate due to resistance
of the compressed gas. After this, the densities are equalized, and consequentlv

so are the conductivity and density of the gas over the cross section of the conduc-
tor. The current density gradient remains high only in a narrow neighborhood of

the inside boundary of the conductor. This produces an additional impact on the

gas near the instant of maximum compression. This is illustrated by Fig. 2, where
we can see that the inside radius of the shell acquires additional inward accelera-
tion near the instant when it stops.

Let us say a few words about the effect that the current passing through the gas
has on the process of compressionof the gas by the shell. The behavior of the
process in all calculations was the sane. Appreciable conductivity in the gas
was noted at times close to the instant of maximum compression of the gas, when
its temperature rose to a value of 1 keV. As the gas was further compressed,

23

its conductivity increased rapidly. becoming several orders of magnitude greater

than that of copper. Current began to flow through the gas. but despite the dif-
ference in conductivities of the materials pointed out above, the current density

in the gas was comparable with the densities of current flowing in the copper be-
cause of the small radii. and hence the large inductive reactance. And since the
cross sectional area of the gas at these instants was several orders of magnitude
less than the cross sectional area of the copper. nearly all the current went through
the copper conductor. The difference of maximum temperature reached in the gas with
and without consideration of conductivity was no more than a few percent.

The efficiency of these installations may be comparatively high. For example in
variant 2 a comparatively small fraction of the DT (about 11) needs .3 be reacted
to get an overall efficiencygreaterthan unity (with respect to the initial energy
store in the lines).

Assumptions to simplify calculations are: one-dimensional approximation. consider-
ation of heat conduction in the diffusion approximation. one-temperature plasma.
and some others that idealize the described results. Therefore the calculations
only illustrate the maximum capabilities of these systems. More complete consider-
ation of the physical phenomena that occur in electric implosion of cylindrical
shells may make considerable coorections both in the results of the calculations
and in the choice of parameters of the systems. However. the calculated results
and data published in Ref. 1-5 show the advisability of further research on com-
pression processes in electric implosion of cylindrical shells.

[Article by Ya. B. Danilevich, doctor of technical sciences, deputy director of
All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Electric Machine Construction, Leningrad]

[Text] In 1920 with proclamation of the GOBLPO Plan [Gosudarstvennaya komiasiya
po elektrifikatsii Rossii; State Commission on Electrification of Russia], our
nation was producing 500 million huh of electric energy per year. In 1979 we pro-
duced 1200 billion kWh, i. e. 2400 times as much.

About 752 of our electric energy is produced in fossil-fuel plants. In the ensuing
years we have built such large GRES's as those in Zaporozh'ye. Uglegorsk and else-
where.

Development of nuclear power has advanced considerably in recent years. Powerful
Ans's have been built: Beloyarsk, Novo-Voronezhsk. Kurak. Leningrad and so on.

Keeping pace with the development of fossil-fuel and nuclear electric plants has
been the development of Soviet turbogenerator construction. The power of the first
Soviet turbogeneratcr was 500 k". At the present time the first turbogenerator

set with power of 1200 NH and speed of 3000 rpm has been put on-line at the Kostroma
GEES. and the Elektrosile Plant has tested the first 1000 MN, 1500 rpm turbogenerator
for an A28.

The development of turbogenerator construction is directly related to the largest
electric machine building plants of Leningrad Industrial Power Association:
Blektrosila, Blektrotyazhmash and Sibelektrotyazhmash. and to the leading scientific
research centers: the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Electrical Ha-
chine Building, the Scientific Research Institute of the Blektrotyazhmash Plant.

the Scientific Research Institute of the Sibelektrotyazhmash Plant. and the Insti-
tute of Electric Motors. UkSSR Academy of Sciences.

Let us examine the principal stages of development of turbogenerator construction.

Prewar Stage of Development. Preparation for turbogenerator production was started
in [923 at the Elektrosila Plant. The first turbogenerators with power_of 500-
3000 k" were made in accordance with blueprints of the Vol'ta Plant that were trans-
ferred to the Blektrosila Plant during World War 1. Ten turbogeneratora of this
type were built in 1926 with total power of about [2,000 k".

From 1924 through 1928 production was mastered on a series of turbogenerators in-
cluding 14 types of machines with power from 300 to 16,000 RH. In 1929 this series
was updated with a reduction in number of types to 9. the power range of the machines
being from 500 to 24,000 kw. Structural components were welded rather than cast

in the new series. and the bearings were improved. The rotors and banding rings
were ordered from abroad. Class A insulation was used for the rotor windings with
the exception of machines with power of 26,000 kw. Active steel sheets were paper-
insulated. The stator winding in the groove section was insulated by a micanite
sleeve, the end sections of the windings were evolute. turned back at an angle

of 90° and insulated by varnished strips. A tangential-radial (pocket) cooling
system was used for the stator. while an axial cooling system with subslot channels
was used for the rotor. Air circulation in the machine was provided by squirrel-
cage blowers on the rotor, the ventilation system was closed with the use of air
coolers.

A great advance in the thirties was mastery of four-pole turbogenerators of 50.000
kw power with introduction of new technological processes at the Blektrosila Plant
[Ref. 10].

Stator winding insulation was continuous, impregnated. made from micatape. Impreg-
nation was with asphalt under pressure in special impregnating autoclaves. The

end sections began to take the shape of a tapered basket, appreciably reducing

the additional short-circuit losses; nonmagnetic stator pressure plates were first
used for the same purpose.

The rotor winding had class B insulation. The insulation in the slotted section
was made in the form of a micanite sleeve; the end sections were insulated by mica-
tape and asbestos tape; aluminum saddles were placed over the insulated end sections.

The turbogenerator had a radial multi-jet cooling system with all cooling air
blown through the gap.

In 1938. the Khar'kov Turbogenerator Plant made the first turbogenerator (four-
pole) with power of 100,000 k". This unit had a compound (three-piece) rotor with
mass of 100 metric tons. This turbogenerator is even now in successful operation
at the Zuyevskaya CRES.

The development of Soviet turbogenerator construction subsequently has taken the
road of two-pole turbogenerator construction.

In 1937 the Blektrosila Plant developed a new series of T2 turbogenerators with
power from 750 RH to [00.000 k".

A turbogenerator with power of 100,000 h" was made in 1937 for the Novomoskovsk
GRES. The mass of the rotor forging was about 50 metric tons. The forging was
made from an ingot with mass of 150 metric tons. The yield stress of the material
was 55 kg/mm’. relative longitudinal extension was more than 161. The generator
was cooled by four free-standing blowers. The rotor had surface cooling.

Turbogenerator Construction in the Parties and Fifties. In 1966 the Elektrosila
Plant made the first hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator with power of 100.000 kw. The
generator had the same geometry of active sections as the air-cooled turbogenerator.

The housing of the machine was made gas-tight and strong. and the machine was
equipped with hydrogen cooling units. According to test data. generator efficiency
was raised by 11.

The next stage in development of turbogenerator construction was a 150.000 RH
hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator made in 1957. This unit now took full advantage

of hydrogen cooling. The turbogenerator was built for a voltage of 18 kV and

power factor of 0.9 with excess hydrogen pressure of 0.7 atm. The rotor diameter
was 1075 mm. and the yield stress of the material was increased to 60 kg/mmz.
Nonmagnetic steel with yield stress of 90 kg/mm2 was used for the banding rings

of the rotor. Axial blowers were used. situated to either side of the rotor barrel.
The rotor was cooled from the outside of the barrel. and in addition the gas was

fed beneath the end sections of the rotor winding. The stator was cooled by a
multi-jet radial arrangement. For cooling the gas, eight gas coolers were provided.
installed vertically in sets of four on each side. This 150.000 k" turbogenerator
was the largest in Europe at that time. and was at the limit of overall dinensiona.

In 1955. turbogenerator construction was transferred from the Khar'kov Turbogenerator
Plant to the State Union Plant of Diesel-Locomotive Electric Equipment. today's
Blektrotyazhmash Plant imeni V. I. Lenin. In 1955 the Blektrotyazhmash Plant worked
out an original design for type TGV-ZS turbogenerator with indirect hydrogen cooling
at a hydrogen pressure of 0.03 atm. This design used welded stator shields with
built-in bearings. a disk hydrogen seal with low oil flowrate. vertical placement

of the gas coolers. fan coolers on the shaft, and cantilevered rotor banding rings.

In 1956. on the basis of the TGV-ZS turbogenerator, the first TVS-30 turbogenerator
was built with power of 30.000 k" with hydrogen cooling at pressure of 0.03-0.5
atm. Height was lower and heating of the and sections of the rotor winding was
reduced as compared with the TGV-ZS turbogenerator.

Turbogenerators With Power of 700,000 and 300.000 k". At the same time that
turbogenerators with indirect hydrogen cooling were being produced at the Blektro-
sila and Elektrotyazhmash plants in 1956-1957. considerable research was being
done to develop new cooling systems.

At the Blektrosila Plant, based on research that had been done. a system was de-
veloped for direct cooling of the rotor winding by hydrogen drawn from the gap
between rotor and stator.

At the Blektrotyazhmash Plant. the TVO-30 turbogenerator with power of 30.000 kw.
voltage of 10.5 kV was developed. manufactured and tested. This turbogenerator

used direct hydrogen cooling of the stator and rotor windings at a hydrogen pressure
of 3 atm. The stator core had an axial ventilation system. A compressor was used
to develop the necessary hydrogen head. An oil end seal for the shaft was used

for the first time with piston rings between the yoke and the insert of the seal.

In 1957. on the basis of research that had been done. the Blektrosila Plant started
making 200.000 kw turbogenerators type IVY-200 with voltage of 11 kV using indirect
hydrogen cooling of the stator winding and direct cooling of the rotor winding

with hydrogen drawn off from the gap. An original multi-jet hydrogen cooling system
with improved technological properties was used for cooling the rotor winding.

An advantage of the system is the comparatively low nonuniformity of heating of

the winding with respect to the length of the rotor. Besides. this system does

not require high gas pressures. and therefore ordinary axial fans can be used

that ensure overall circulation of the gas in the machine. Lengthwise of the rotor.
sections with input orifices on the surface of the active part alternate with sec—
tions of output orifices. providing the multiple jets in the system. The end sec-
tions of the winding are cooled by gas that flows through internal channels milled
in the turns of the winding. The winding and core of the stator are cooled by
hydrogen circulating through radial channels in the core and in the zone of the

end sections of the winding. The stator is cooled by a three-jet radial system.
The sectioning of the rotor is matched to the stator ventilation arrangement.

After making two TVF-ZOO turbogenerators. it was deemed advisable to use water-
cooled stator windings for 200,000 kw machines. Therefore the TVP series was sub-
sequently retained for powers of 60.000 and 100.000 k”.

The construction and technology for manufacturing water-cooled windings were studied
on an experimental 30.000 kw turbogenerator. Tests of the machine showed high
efficiency of the system. and therefore it was used for turbogenerators of

150.000 k" or more.

The first turbogenerator of the TVV series with power of 150.000 kw and voltage

of 18 kV with water-cooled stator winding and direct hydrogen cooling of the rotor
winding was made by the Elektrosila Plant in 1959. Subsequently, TVV-ZCO-Z turbo-
generators were built with powers of 200.000 k". 15 and 75 kV. and the TVV-300-2
with power of 300,000 kw. 20 kV. These units were series produced.

Water cooling of the stator windings is accomplished by forcing water through in-
ternal channels in the conductors of the cores. The hollow conductors in the cores
alternate with solid conductors. The ends of each rod are soldered to polepieces
that have lugs for current connections and a chamber for the cooling water. The
cooling water is fed to the chambers of these polepieces by insulation hoses from
a ring-shaped header. Cooling of the rotor winding is by direct water feed of

the TV? type.

In connection with the reduction in hydrogen consumption, a single-jet draft system
was used for cooling the stator core with bilateral drawing of the gas from the
gap between rotor and stator.

Turbogenerators of the TVV type are made on pedestal bearings. The bearing inserts
are self-leveling with spherical support surface. Unitized housingsare used in
[50.000 and 200,000 kw machines with openings for the gas coolers. which are hori-
zontally placed. A takedown housing is used in the 300.000 kH turbogenerators.

In these units the length of the central part is approximately equal to the length
of the active part. and the end sections of the housing, which are rectangular

in shape, cover the end parts of the stator winding and accommodate the gas coolers
and leads. The end parts are secured to the middle section. The 200,000 and
300.000 kw turbogenerators use an elastic suspension for the stator core. In the
ribs of the stator on which the stator core is assembled. at the points where they
are fastened to the walls of the housing, slots are cut through in the tangential
direction so that the core is joined to the housing through a system of-springé
like supports.

The stator core is assembled of sheets of cold-rolled transformer steel with spe-
cific losses of the order of 1 H/kg.

The stator has a two-layer bar winding. The elementary conductors are transposed
by 560° along the active '.rt of the bar.

All fastening components of the end sections of the stator winding are made of
nonmagnetic materials to reduce losses. A shield in the form of a copper ring
is placed under the pressure plate. The teeth of the end stacks are made with
slots.

The rotors are made of one-piece forgings. The rotor windings are made in the
form of half-coils that are connected as they are placed in the rotor slots.
Duralumin wedges are fastened in the grooved part of the winding. and nonmagnetic
banding rings are fastened in the end sections.

The banding unit is doubled-seated in the TVV-ZOO-Z and TVV-320-2 turbogenerators
with seating on the rotor barrel with an elastic centering ring secured to the
rotor.

The oil seal of the rotor shaft is an end seal with adjustable pressure of the
seal insert.

In 1959 the Elektrotyazhmash Plant made the first TGV-ZOO turbogenerator with power
of 200.000 k". and in 1961 produced the TGV-300 turbogenerator with power of
300.000 k“. These generators were based on the TVO-30 experimental turbogenerator.

The rotor winding is cooled in a bilateral axial arrange-ant of internal cooling
of the conductors. The cooling gas is forced into the zone of the end sections.
from which it flows through lateral input apertures into inner channels of the
conductors through which it goes to the middle of the rotor and is thrown through
a system of radial channels into the gap of the machine. The stator winding is
cooled by a stream of gas flowing through metal tubes in bars situated between
two vertical rows of elementary conductors. To ensure circulation of hydrogen

in the machine. high-pressure squirrel-cage blowers are installed on one side of
the rotor. and low-pressure fans are placed on the other side.

The stator core in TGV-ZOO turbogenerators is cooled in a radial arrangement, and
in the TGV-300--in an axial arrangement.

The TGV—ZOO and TGV-300 turbogenerators are made on shield hearings. The bearings
are installed in end shields with a horizontal split. The shields are secured
to the stator housing.

The stator core is fastened in the stator housing on elastic hangers in the form
of plate springs. The core is assembled in a comparatively light housing that
is connected to the machine housing by steel plates.

A single-seated banding unit is used in the TGV-200 and TGV-300 turbogenerators
with seating of the banding on the rotor barrel.

The Novosibirsk Sibelektrotyazhmash Plant beganproducing turbogenerators 1n the
fifties. This plant mastered production of the TV? turbogenerators developed by
the Elektrosila Plant with powers of 60.000 and 100.000 k“. In 1952 the plant

made an experimental turbogenerator type TVHP60 with power of 60.000 k“ of original
design with oil-filled stator. water—cooled rotor winding. oil-paper insulation

and internal oil-cooling of bars. TVH-300 turbogenerators with power of 300.000 kw
[Ref. 8] were developed and put into production on the basis of the TVH-GO.

The 200.000 and 300.000 kw turbogenerators were updated and improved during use.
The most important changes involved using thermosetting insulation of the stator
winding. At the same time. the systems for fastening the stator winding were im-
proved, semiconducting wavy side liners were introduced in the grooved section,
in the end sections. liners were used that were made of molding materials filling
i1 the gaps between the bars and fastening components. self-seating Dacron cords
were used.

Equalization of stiffness with respect to axes of symmetry was used in the rotors
of the 300.000 kw turbogenerator.

The double-seated banding arrangement in turbogenerators of the TVV series was
replaced by a single-seating arrangement with seating on the rotor barrel. the
banding ring being fastened by a special sleeve nut. At the same time. a damper
system in the form of a short-circuited lug was used on the rotor in TVV-320-2
turbogenerators.

Turbogenerators with Power of 500,000 kH. In 1950. the Blektrosila Plant made
the first TVV-SOO-Z turbogenerator with power of 500.000 kw (Ref. 1].

The TVV-SOO-Z. like other turbogenerators of this series. had direct water cooling
of the stator windings, a single-jet draft arrangement for hydrogen cooling and
direct hydrogen cooling of the rotor winding with gas takeoff from the gap.

Centrifugal blowers were used rather than axial fans. and the radial ventilation
channels in the stator were 5 mm wide. The end sections of the rotor winding were
cooled in a two-jet arrangement.

To reduce losses. the rotor winding had trapezoidal rather than rectangular slots.
and the small coils of the winding were made with a reduced number of turns. To
improve the thermal stability of the rotor in asymmetric regimes. a shorting ring
was installed in the form of a two-layer copper lug overlapping the insulation
covering the end sections of the rotor winding from the outside.

The banding ring of the rotor was seated only on the barrel and was prevented from
axial displacements by a sleeve nut.

Subsequently during series production of turbogenerators. the system of fastening
the stator winding in the end section was improved. and a tangential ventilation
arrangement was introduced for the stator core.

In [965. a TGV-SOO turbogenerator with power of 500.000 kw and speed of 3000 rpm
was made at the Elektrotyazhmash Plant.

In contrast to the lower-power turbogenerators of the Blektrotyazhmash Plant. the
TGV-SOO had water-cooled rotor and stator windings.

Supply and return of the water to the stator winding was through special feed-
through insulators. The connecting lines and end leads of the stator winding were
also water—cooled. A special end seal was used for cooling water supply to the
rotor. The water was fed through central orifices of the exciter and generator
shafts to a distribution header. from which water lines brought it to the coils

of the rotor winding which was connected in parallel with respect to water flow.
The current feeder of the rotor was also water-cooled.

The generator used a single-jet radial core ventilation system with distribution
from the gap. The pressure plates of the stator core were water—cooled.

Vibration isolation of the stator core was by leaf springs. As opposed to other
turbogenerators of the TGV type. the springs were placed only in the vertical plane.
and connected the sealed inner housing of the stator directly to the foundation.
The end sections of the stator housing were covered by shields with elastic coupling

to the core housing.

The generator bearings were accommodated in shields resting on the foundation.

Subsequently in putting the TGV-SOO turbogenerators into series production, improve-
ments were made in the system of fastening of the stator winding and core in the
housing. and in the technique of soldering the rotor coils.

In 1978. based on experience in developing turbogenerators of the TVH series. the
Sibelektrotyazhmash Plant made the first TVH-SOO turbogenerator with power of
500.000 k" for increased voltage of 36 and 75 kV. Like the TVH-SOO. this turbo-
generator has an oil-cooled winding and core in the stator. and a water-cooled
rotor winding. The stator winding has oil-paper insulation. The end stacks in
the TVH-SOO generator are beveled. The core is tensioned in the axial direction
by bolts running through the back. Axial channels of rectangular shape are made
in the core for cooling purposes. The stator winding bars are made up of solid
conductors of short height. A cooling channel is formed between the conductor
columns. The winding is held in the slots of the core by opposed wedges. The
generator rotor has a hollow damping system formed by copper strips laid in the
rotor slots and closed by copper lugs. The gap is cooled by the distillate circulat-
ing through tubes in shallow slots at the crowns of the teeth of the rotor barrel.

Turbogeneratora Hith Power of 800.000 k“. In 1970 the Blektrosila Plant made the
first turbogenerator with power of 800.000 k" type TVV-800-2 [Ref. 12].

In this turbogenerator there was a considerable improvement in the ventilation
system. the design of the fastening for the stator winding and core. the damper
system of the rotor. operation of the brush equipment. and the oil seals of the
shaft.

A hydrogen gas tangential ventilation arrangement with countermotion of the cooling
hydrogen in the stator compartments was introduced for cooling the stator core.
Internal channels were used in the rotor for the multi-jet system instead of the
side channels in the 500.000 kw turbogenerator. Rotor cooling efficiency was

32

I1JR!OIIWCIA1.IISII(NVLY

considerably improved by installing axial barriers in the gap. and by improving
cooling of the end sections of the rotor winding coils.

Opposed wedges and liners.of molding materials were used to hold the stator wind-
ings in the slot. Monolithic fastening of the end sections of the winding was
effected by using molding materials. epoxy cements. self-seating cords and massive
fiberglass plastic rings. The design provided for continuous pressing of the end
sections of the winding by wedges and titanium springs. and also by the capability
for axial displacements of the winding with changing loads.

Core vibration was additionally reduced by increasing its elastic modulus. and
by much better fastening of the core in the housing.

To reduce heating of the end stacks. the number of stepped end stacks of the core
was increased. and cooling was improved.

Now in series production are 800,000 k" turbogenerators with hydrogen-water cooling.
Seven of these generators are now being successfully used in power systems.

In addition to producing turbogenerators with water-hydrogen cooling. the Elektro-
sila Plant is doing research on completely water-cooled turbogenerators [Ref. 7.
11]. This work was started in 1968 when the first experimental turbogenerator

with power of 63.000 RH and speed of 3000 rpm was made. Successful operation of

the experimental generator. and the results of studies on prototypes and models

led to production of the first TZV-BOO turbogenerator in 1978 with power of 800.000
RH and speed of 3000 rpm. totally water-cooled without hydrogen filling. The gener-
ator has direct water cooling of the windings of stator. rotor. and damping winding,
stator core. structural components and brush apparatus. The volume of the machine
is filled with nitrogen at low excess pressure.

A distinguishing feature of the system is the use of a self-pressurized arrangement
for water-cooling of the rotor winding. Hater runs freely into a ring header open
to the shaft. is picked up by the turning rotor. goes to the lower leads of the
coils. flows through the coils and leaves through the upper leads.

The stator core is cooled by flat silumin coolers containing coiled stainless steel
tubing. The coolers take the form of active steel segments and are pressed between
the stacks.

The core is elastically fastened only on the side walls of the stator.

The end sections of the stator winding are held between fiberglass plastic rings.
Compression of the end sections is by springs and a system of tension members and
thrust blocks. The end sections are held together by cold-setting epoxy cement.
The generator uses a complete damper winding placed beneath the slot wedges of
the rotor. In the vicinity of the end sections. the bars of the damper winding
are shorted by copper segments. The winding is also cooled by a self-pressurized
arrangement.

The turbogenerator has been successfully tested on a stand in the Elektrosila Plant
and has been put into experimental operation at s GRES.

Turbogenerator With Power of 1.2 Million kw. In 1976 the Blektrosila Plant produced
the largest two-pole turbogenerator in the world. Like the s--ies—produced TVV-800-2
turbogenerator with power of 800,000 kw, the TVV-lZOO-Z (power of 1.2 million R")

has direct hydrogen cooling of the rotor winding in a multi—jet arrangement. the
stator housing is filled with hydrogen, and the stator winding is made with direct
water cooling. Cooling in the generator is intensifed in the end sections of the
core.

To ensure high reliability of the generator with increased use of the active volume,
a six-phase configuration of the stator winding for the first tine has replaced
the traditional three-phase arrangement.

In connection with an increase in the excitation winding current (to 7720 A as
compared with the 3800 A in the 800.000 kH turbogenerator). a brushless excitation
system has been used. The exciter is made with two armstures and two magnet systems
as part of a system for noncontact monitoring and measurement.

The turbogenerator has been successfully stand-tested at the plant, and has been
put into operation.

Turbogenerator With Speed of 1500 rpm. In 1976. the Elektrotyashmash Plant
finished making the first modern rcv-soo-a four-pole turbogenerator with power
of 500.000 kw [Ref. 9]. The turbogenerator is designed around the features of
the rcv-soo turbogenerator with 500,000 kw power and speed of 3000 rpm that is
made by the same plant, and likewise uses direct water cooling of the windings
of the stator and rotor and hydrogen filling of the stator housing.

The stator housing of the generator is made in three sections: the core with wind-
ing is assembled in the middle section, and the gas coolers and oil seals of the
rotor shaft are accommodated in the end sections. The oil seals are of ring type
with self-aligning inserts. Fastening of the stator windings is rigid with the_
use of molding materials. bracing wedges and cleats.

The generator rotor is composite. Banding rings of nonmagnetic steel are made
with single seating. The end wedges of the rotor are of opposed type. made of
bronze. fit tightly into the slot. and are driven into the slot with tight fit.
The wedges overlap the joints in the region of the joints between rotor parts.

The generator uses a brushless exciter consisting of a synchronous inverted generator.
rotating rectifier and inductor generator.

The turbogenerator combined with the brushless exciter has been stand-tested at
.the plant and is now in power plant operation.

In 1980 the Elektrosila Plant made and tested the first TVV-lOOO-b turbogenerator
with power of 1 million kw at a speed of 1500 rpm. The generator has the same
cooling system and design as the series-produced TVV-800-2 with power of 800,000 k“.
The rotor winding and stator core are hydrogen-cooled, and the stator winding is
water-cooled.

The turbogenerator has increased current volume in the stator slot (up to 26 kA).
and therefore particular emphasis has been placed on the fastening of the winding.

36

FOR‘OFFKJAI.USE(HVLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

The fastening of the winding in the slot was tested on a prototype. The design

of the end stack of the core was improved. The water of core stacks was increased,
and their cooling was improved. Improvements were also made in the cooling of

the rotor windings. and subslot wedges were introduced in the zone of transition
from the soltted section to the end section.

The rotor forging was of welded and forged construction.

Outlook for Future Development of Turbogenerator Construction. The next power
stage will be turbogenerators with power of 1.6-2 million m at 3000 and 1500 rpm.
Analysis has shown (Ref. 2, 3. 4. 13] that generators of this power can be built
on the basis of turbogenerators that have already been made and tested in the power
range of 800.000-l.200,000 kw. It will be necessary to use rotor forgings of
greater mass. and to do research on further improvement of cooling systens and

the design of individual nachine components.

A still further increase in power would have to be based on using the effect of
superconductivity [Ref . S]. which is completely realistic. given the rapid progress
in development of generators of this type.

REMOTE MEASURDIENT OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY AND AVERAGE ROVER IN POWER SYSTDiS
Moscow ELEKTRICHESTVO in Russian No 6, Jun 81 (manuscript received 15 Her 79) PP 2-6

[Article by V.A. Bogdanov. Central Dispatching Administration for the USSR Unified
Power System Integrated Power Grid]

[Text] The control, planning and analysis of power systems operating modes are
realized on the basis of information. an important component of which is measurements
of electrical power and energy. The automated control and operational monitoring are
based on remore measurements (TI) of the power. where these measurements are trans-
mitted via multichannel pulse code remote control units (UTM), with reset cycles
which have a length of T1 < 20 sec. The planning and analysis of operating modes

are predicated on hourly measurements of the power. transmitted via data transmis-
sion equipment. teletype and telephone as part of the daily dispatcher control

sheet.

At the present time. extremely important parameters for dispatcher control are
lacking in the remote measurements and the daily control sheet: the electrical
power generated by the main electric power stations. power overcurrents an inter-
system and interstate power transmission lines. electrical power consumption in
the major load centers. etc. The values of the indicated parameters are needed by
the dispatcher for various time intervals: an hour. a work shift, the peak load

period. etc.

Remote measurements are especially needed for the increments of electrical power
for the monitoring and control of power overcurrents in the "USSR -- CEHA Member
Nations" section. where half-hourly metering periods are employed. The derivation
of the indicated parameters by the interpolation of measurements of the instantan-
eous power values yields an impermissibly large error.

The organization of remote measurements of power increments and the average power
by means of electronic power metering counters which have multichannel pulse-code
remote control units. cumunications channels and ASDU [automated dispatcher control
system for a power association] computer hardware is treated in this article.

The electronic counters (ES) are produced by the Vil'nyus Plant for Electrical
Measurement Equipment 07-1041) and the Leningrad Electromechanical Plant (P-651).
Electronic counters are produced abroad by a whole series of companies. For

example, the Swiss company of Landis and Gyr ('l'ettex AG Instrulents) produces a
large assortment of electronic counters which are used in the power systems of cm
member nations. An extremely important advantage of electronic counters over con-
ventional electromechanical meters is the high level of precision (0.l--0.5). ?or
this reason, it is 'ﬂawed that active and reactive power will be metered by means
of electronic counters in the mediate future at all of the largest electric power
stations and on intersystem and interstate links.

An electronic counter is an analog-digital device in which one can single out the
following main components: the measurement unit, 10; the divider circuitry, DS;

the crystal oscillator. CK: the readout display, BI; and the counting mechanism,
SM.

The currents 11 and voltages 111 from the instrment transformers for each phase are
fed to the input of the measurement unit. Using the principle of double modulation,
the measurement units converts 11 and [11 to a numerical pulse code. The number of
pulses N at the output of the measurement is proportional to the quantity of
electrical power in the forward (f) and return (r) direction over the measurement
period To:

f -l. _ r -l
uf - l3 1 111 11°C“, Nr /3 IiUiTOCOe
Na: V3— ”WI-€353 "0:: ,3- IO‘U’T°Ce-’|' (1)

where coc is the pulse value equal to the quantity of electrical power associated
with each pulse at the output of the measurnent units.

If the measurement unit segregates the active component, 11.33,, the electronic
counter measures the active power. In the case where 113“”, is used in (1),

the reactive power ismetered. Thus, for example. the type P-lolol electronic counter
provides for simultaneous metering of the sctiwie and reactive forward and return
power.

The DS divider circuitry consists of electronic circuits which reduce the fre-
quency of the signals incoming from the measurement unit and the crystal oscillator.
Pulsed signals can be obtained from the outputs of the divider circuitry. the fre-
quenty of which is the requisite number of times less than the frequency at the
input. The forward and return power metering signals, which are fed to the input
of the counting mechanism, have a frequency which is 81 times less than the fre-
quency of the NE and N1— signals at the input to the divider circuitry. The co-
efficient 81 is chosen by working from the capacity of the counting mechanism, the
precision class of the instrument and the requisite periodicity and duration of
continuous electrical power metering (without zeroing the counting mechanism).

The readout display is intended for visually monitoring the operation of the elec-
tronic counter. For this reason, the signals fed to the display input have s

FIHICMHHCJAI.IISIICHVLV

frequency which is 80 times less than the frequency of the Nf and Er signals. The
value of so is chosen so that at the minimum value of I1, no less than one pulse
every 10 to 15 seconds is fed to the input of the readout display.

The crystal oscillator is the source of the £0 frequency which controls the opera-
tion of the divider circuitry, as well as the measurement unit modulator and con-
verter. To compensate for the zero drift in the counter characteristics, a peri-
odic change is made in the polarity of the modulator output signal by means of the
crystal oscillator signals and the output pulses of the measurement unit converters
are switched accordingly. The divider circuitry produces the requisite signals at
a frequency o1 times less than fo.

Thus. electric power metering signals can be obtained from an electronic counter
with a pulse value of 811 COe- as well as crystal oscillator signals at a frequency
of oifo. This makes it possible to use electronic counters for remote transmis-
sion of power values E(To) and average values of the power over the measurement
period H(To) by means of existing Iultichannel pulse-code remote control units.
Moreover, electronic counters can be used for the measurement of 8(To) and W(To)
directly in a power facility. In this case, the electronic counter is used as a
meter, from the output of which the numerical code for the parameter being mea-
sured is fed to the digital or analog readout of the corresponding instrment.

In the latter case, the numerical code of the parameter being measured should be
preconverted to an analog signal by means of digital to analog converters. For
the direct measurement and remote measurement of E(T ) and w(To). the existing
electronic counters must be complemented with specie interfaces.

An interface* incorporates the following: a bidirectional counter RS, which con-
tains nine bitsgenSB circuit which blocks the arrival of power metering pulses

at the inputs to the bidirectional counter;anSU circuit which sets the bidirec-
tional taunter to the initial state; a parallel carry circuit SPP, an eight bit

output register VR and a switch P.

The position of the switch determines the value of the power metering pulses and
the crystal oscillator signal frequency incoming from the divider circuit. For
any setting of the switch, pulses are fed from it which set all flip-flops of the
divider circuitry registers to zero, where these flip-flops reduce the frequency
of the crystal oscillator and feed out the oifo signals. It is expedient to
transmit E(To) over periods of one hour or less, but necessarily submultiples of
one hour. For this reason, to synchronize the start of power readout for
various facilities with astronomical time, any change in the position of the
switch should be made by servicing personnel after each repair and check of the
electronic counter and the interface at the start of any time interval based on
precision time signals.

Grid of the USSR Unified Power System participated in the design of the interface:

The Biﬂf pulses are fed to the adding input, while 818, are fed to the subtract
input of the bidirectional counter through the SB blocking circuit.

The SB blocking unit, in accordance with the oifo signal incoming from the divider
circuit, blocks the arrival of the electrical power metering pulses at the inputs

of the bidirectional counter. Right after this, the parallel carry circuit carries
the contents of the bidirectional counter to the output register. The carry is
accomplished taking into account the state of the lowest order ninth digit of the
bidirectional counter, the contents of which are added before this to the contents
of the eight high order digits of the bidirectional counter. After completing this
procedure, the SU reset circuit sets the bidirectional counter to the initial state.
while the SB blocking circuit enables the pulses to get to the bidirectional counter.

If the measurement is aade in a section with bidirectional power flows, the amount
of electrical power is:

-1 _ -1 .,
2(1'0) - KIK081 cognac - Ny) - 3(To)—K:Ka3.- C..(".;— N,).

where K}; and Ku are the transformation ratios of the current and voltage instru—
ment transformers; Nt- - (Nf - NI)“ + ﬂy is the nuber of pulses registered by
the bidirectional counter at the measurement period; ﬂy is the nuﬁer of pulses
in the initial state of the bidirectional counter, specified by the SU reset cir-

cuitry.

If the power is tranuitted only in the forward direction, ﬂy a 0. When measuring
the power transmitted only in the return direction, Ry - .512.

Thus, the measurement period is governed by the frequency incoming from the divider
circuitry to the inputs of the SB blocking circuitry, the SU reset circuit and the
parallel carry circuit: To - (o1fo)‘1, and is numerically equal to the time between
two successive data updates at the output register.

The remote transmission of 20],) using the multichannel pulse-code remote control

units in service at the present time can be accomplished in the form of telemetry
signals in a "remte measuruent repeating" mode. In both cases. the parameters
of the output register should be matched to the parneters of the remote control
unit with respect to the input impedance.

In the case of the cyclical transmission of 8(1'0), the following condition should
be met to avoid data losses and distortion:

where t” is the switching t'me of the output register elements of the interface;
v is the telemetry data transmission rate through the communications channel;
Tcyc is the duration of the renewal cycle with which the transmission of the tele-
metry data is accomplished.

If E(l‘o) is transmitted sporadically, then the following condittion must be met to
avoid data losses and distortions:

where Tm is the maximum time from the moment of query appearance (a change in the
state of the output resiter digits) until the coupletion of the transmision of the
group of telemetry signals, in which E(‘l‘o) is transmitted.

Power measurement precision can be characterized by the referenced total mean
square error [1]. When using transducers with a standard analog output signal, the
mean square reference error for remote power measurements is:

p \—
351/5747 0+a'.+ at...” “+5 +3..” (2)

The couponents of the overall_ referenced mean square error indicated in (2) are
due to the following: 61 and Gu of the current and voltage instrument transformers;
6I from the tranducer which converts the parameter being measured to a standard
analog signal; 6p,“ and 60 from the level quantization of the sensor signal dur-
ing transmission and the back-conversion of the digital code to analog. form at the
receive end (the static error), 5|: frm the canunications channel;6 from the
time quantization of the sensor signal (the dynamic error): 6.1;, from tge analog
meter.

When the measurements are fed into a digital computer, there is no need for con-
verting the received code to analog form or the corresponding meter. In this case,
one can use 60.” - énp - 0.

The codes employed in modern remote control units provide for a--sufficient1y high
level of protection of the transmitted data against interference in the channel
and make it possible to not only detect, but in a number of cases correct distor-
tions which appear. For this reason, it can he seemed that in those cases where

on the units where the electronic counters are installed for purposes of netering
and there are remote control units with back-up subchannels. Measurements of

It is expedient to transmit £00) with periods of To - 1'1 hours, where i is
any integer. If it is necessary to transmit worm and E('l'o) from the same unit,
two identical interfaces are connected to the ele-ztronic counter. A value of To,
close to 1' [Tcycln with which the remote measurements of the other parameters are
transaitted, is set on one unit by means of the switch P. Then, based on precise
time signals, the position of the switch P is set on the second unit which
provides the requisite periodicity for the measurement of the energy increments.

When using ranote control units which provide only for the cyclical transmission
of the remote measuresents and telemetry signals, one subchannel each is set

aside for the transmission of "(10) and B(To). The energy increment is tramitted
as many times as the specified time interval is greater than the reset cycle of

the remote control unit. In the sporadic case, "(10) and 3(1‘0) are transmitted
until the arrival of signals via a feedback channel which confirm the correctness
of the reception. In both cases, losses of B(‘l‘o) are possible because of failures
of the remote control unit and the camaunicstions channels only in the case of
failures which last longer than the measurement period.

Construction, and 0. I. Sisunenko. deputy director of the All-Union Institute of

Transformer Construction. Zaporozh'ye]

[Text] The resolutions of the Twenty-Fifth Congress of the CPS" emphasize the
importance of ongoing development of the power industry in the USSR.

One of the sectors of the national economy of the nation that ensures development
of the electric power industry is transformer construction.

Progress in transformer construction is based on perfecting designs. considerably
improving the properties of the sagnetic and insulating materials that are used,
perfecting production technology and developing present-day production capabilities.

of single-phase units.

At present in the Soviet Union transformers with high voltage up to 330 RV inclusive
are being made only in the three-phase version. for voltage of 500 kV-in single-
phase and three-phase modifications. and for 750 W and up—only single-phase.

In the Tenth Five-Year Plan. industry has aastered production of a lOOO-HVA trans-
former for voltage of 330 kV. In 1978 the first autotranaformer with power of

667 HVA (2000 HVA in a three-phase group) and winding voltage combination of

1150/500 RV was made and delivered for experinental operation in a special power-
grid stand .

the development of high-power transformers is tied up with a rixe in generator
power. since the most economic solution for electric power plants is the develop-
ment of generator-transformer units. But since the energy produced by the electric
power plants has to be transformed to different voltages. there has been a sharp
rise in the research and development of transformers. Table 1 shows the powers

of transformers for energy-producing units of different voltages.

Fig. 2 shows the increase in nominal voltage of transformers in the postwar period.
The sixties saw a period of intense development of 330 and 500 kV power grids.
Electric transmission lines of 750 kV were built in the seventies. Autotransformers
with power of 333 HVA and voltage combination of 750/330 kV. and with power of

417 HVA and voltage combination of 750/500 kV were developed and produced for these
lines. Industrial delivery of autotransformers for electric transmission lines

of 1150 kV is planned for the beginning of the Eleventh Five—Year Plan.

In the seventies. industry mastered production of transformers and a reactor for
power transmission lines on a voltage of 2750 kV. These are in experimental opera-
tion on a test stand in the city of Tol'yatti. These transformers are essentially
ready for use in 2750 kVDC power transmission lines. However. to improve trans-
mission economy. work is now in progress on higher-power transformers (320 NVA
instead of 175 HVA).

The production of transformer equipment for 500. 750 and 1150 kV has covered the
prospects for development of the electric power industry. On the other hand. solu-
tion of the problem of material inputs in transformer construction depends primarily
on the technical level of transformers in classes of 6-10. 35 and 110 kv. The
demand for materials in these classes makes up more than 802 of the total require-
ments of transformer construction. Therefore in recent years considerable attention
has been devoted to development of 110—kv transformers. Industry has mastered
production of the first types of three-phase llO-kV transformers with load-switching
regulator in which wood laminate plastics are used. as well as lead-ins with solid
insulation. and also reinforced wire. This has reduced the inputs of ferrous metals
by 352 and cut open-circuit losses by 282. Pull-scale introduction of this series
will in future keep the parameters of liO-kV transformers at the level attained

by the leading non-Soviet companies.

The Eleventh Five-Year Plan calls for introducing a new series of 35-kv transformers
with power of 1000-6300 kVA. Material inputs for transformers of this series have
been reduced by a factor of 1.5. The savings in rolled ferrous metal stock will
amOunt to 500 metric tons per million kVA of output.

A new series of transformers for voltage of 10 RV at power of 25-630 kVA has now
been designed and is being put into production with technical characteristics on

a level with analogs of leading non-Soviet companies. A distinguishing feature

of the design of these transformers is the coiled spatial structure of the magnetic
circuit. 0n the first stage, introduction of the new series is being done on the
basis of traditional aluminum wires with paper insulation and radiator tanks. Any
further increase in the technical level of this series presupposes the use of alu—
minum enameled wires and corrugated tanks.

Development of present-day transformers is based on advancing development of re—
search on the various aspects of transformer construction.

To develop transformers with prospective voltages. a number of steps are being
carried out to severely limit lightning and commutation surges. including the devel-
opment of new arresters.

Based on generalization of studies on permissible field intensities in oil-barrier
insulation. permissible field strengths have been established in the channels
adjacent to the windings. and requirements have been worked out for the design.

technological processes and testing of an experimental transformer. The experi-
mental 0RTs-l35000/500 transformer is intended for replacement of 0TsG-l35000/500
transformers at the Volzhskaya CBS to verify the method of selecting the internal
insulation with respect to prolonged action of the working voltage under operating
conditions.

A considerable reduction in test voltages of the 500 kV winding as compared with
State Standard GOST 1516.1-76 (by 30-40!) has enabled a reduction by more than

30% in the dimensions of the main insulation between windings and to grounded sec-
tions. as well as reducing the dimensions of longitudinal insulation (see Table 2).

The encouraging results of work with the 0RTs-l35000/500 transformer opens up the
possibility of considerably reducing material inputs of transformers for high vol-
tage classes.

Construction quality is determined to a great extent by the availability of reliable
design methods. Development of new methods of calculation and improvement of exist-
ing ones is one of the important areas of research and development over the last
decade. Techniques have been developed for calculating magnetic and electric
fields. additional losses in structural components, lightning and commutation surges
in complex windings, current distribution in multiparallel windings. Development

is nearing completion on an improved method of calculating the electrodynamic
strength of transformer windings. a new technique has been developed for mechanical
calculation of complicated components like the tank and pressing beams. Methods
are being develoPed for optimization calculations in selection of variants. Exten-
sive computerization of engineering calculations has considerably facilitated the

work of the designer, provided more in-depth computational analysis of items being
designed. and improved the reliability of design features. The same can be said
of the wide use of methods of physical and mathematical modeling in feasibility
studies and also in research and development.

At present, work is near completion on development of a computational subsystem,
and by the end of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan the graphic subsystem of the system
for automated design of transformers is to be put into operation.

Improvements are continuously being made in design of the major components of
transformers. which is conducive to the contstant improvement of the technical charac-
teristics. reduction of material inputs and increased operational reliability.

The magnetic circuits of power transformers are of grain-oriented rolled trans-
former steel 0.3—0.35 mm thick with losses of P1_5-0.95-l.02 H/kg. The use of
fiberglass plastic banding has eliminated the holes in the steel for rods, reducing
the level of losses and the open-circuit current. Currently work is being done

in cooperation with metallurgists to develop transformer steel with low residual
stresses, which in the future will eliminate process annealing of steel at trans-
former plants.

Open-circuit losses can be further reduced by making a mgnetic circuit with complete
diagonal joining, further improving the quality of transformer steel (reducing
the specific losses to P15= 0.8-0.82 H/kg).

Tn transformers with power of 25-630 INA the open-circuit characteristics are con-
siderably improved by introducing a three-dimensional design of magnetic circuits
made of coiled elements.

At the present time in power transformers the windings for voltages up to 35 W
are helical with a large number of parallel conductors, the 110-330 kV windings
are continuous coils. for 500 kv or more the windings are looped. Special steps
to reduce intercoil gradients with pulse factors in continuous windings have obvi-
ated the need for shields and additional coil insulation. In looped windings.
arrangements have been developed that give good distribution of voltages between
individual sections and segments of the windings with resultant high pulse strength
of the entire insulation structure. Transposed wires have been extensively intro-
duced. reducing additional losses in the windings and improving labor productivity
in making them.

Further research should be aimed at finding a lightning-proof design for transformer
windings at the power limit. 1. e. windings that have good distribution of pulse
voltages and can pass a current of 3 M.

The improvement of high-voltage transformer insulation involves further studies

of oil-barrier designs, the use of rigid specially shaped insulating components
for inhomogeneous field sections. A considerable part is played in this question
by development of improved equipment and techniques for making such components,
cleanliness and dust-free conditions in production departments. technology for
drying insulation. Research aimed at improving the main insulation of transformers
is an ongoing process involving the entire arsenal of scientific and technical
capabilities, computer calculations, mathematical modeling on semiconducting paper

51

and in an electrolyte bath. testing prototypes of components and complex models
of insulation in full scale. Hultifaceted studies result in reliable design solu-
tionshz the area of electric insulation for transformers.

A primary part in development of transformers at the limit of power is played by
expert designing of components from the standpoint of eddy losses caused by leakage
fluxes of the windings. Any failures in this aspect will result in considerable
heating.

At present fairly reliable methods have been developed for calculating and modeling
these effects. In the development of new designs, extensive use is made of physical
scale-model ing of the entire transformer and individual structural components.
enabling detection of points of concentration of additional losses at an early
stage. so that means can be worked out for avoiding overheating. In designing
transformers of maximum power, shunting of massive metal components by stacks of
transformer steel and other design features are used to reduce heating.

In connection with the growth of capacities of energy distribution systems in recent
years, the problem of dynamic stability of transformers under short-circuit con-
ditions has been especially acute. For a number of years research has been in
progress on all major factors that influence dynamic stability: methods of calcu-
lation have been improved; new design features have been researched and introduced;
improvements have been made in winding manufacture ensuring retention of geometric
dimensions after drying; stiffer insulation cardboard with less shrinkage is being
used.

At the same time, new structural components are being developed and introduced

for pressing the windings of power trnasformers. ensuring the required force even
with some shrinkage of insulation materials. A promising direction is the use

of hydraulic jacks. enabling adjustment of pressing of the windings during operation
without raising the bell (upper part of the tank).

Simultaneous research is being done on using reinforced wires.

At present, the Ministry of the Electrical Engineering Industry has no special
stand for electrodynamic tests of transformers, obviating experiments on this
problem. The construction of such a stand is a major problem for the transformer
building subsector in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.

At the present time considerable work is being done on perfecting internal and
external cooling of transformers. More precise methods have been developed for
temperature calculations of windings with natural and forced circulation of oil
through the windings. Transformers of maximum power use mainly directional circu-
lation of oil. Cooling devices of the 111's type have been considerably modified
(forced movement of oil through an air-blasted cooler). New coolers have been
introduced with low-speed blowers. submerged pumps with shielded stator, and new
bimetallic cooling tubes with cut ribbing (to turbulize the airflow). Cooling
devices may-be either suspended or individually installed. Transformers for large
generating facilities chiefly have a water-oil cooling system.

One of the factors that guarantees accident-free operation of transformers is stable
up-to—date technology for making components and subassemblies, assembling and drying

52

at the manufacturing plant. Considerable advances have been made in this area
in the last 10-15 years.

With the switch to rolled transformer steel there has been a considerable reduction
in the labor inputs for making magnetic circuits and an improvement in their quality.
Outages involving fire in steel have practically disappeared. This is the result

of development and introduction of automatic lines in transformer plants of the
subsector for longitudinal and transverse cutting of transformer steel, special
stands for assembling and edging magnetic circuits.

A series of machines. lines and fixtures have been developed and to a considerable
extent introduced that improve the quality and productivity of labor in manufacture

of insulation components and windings. The windings of large transformers are
made on vertical winding machines.

Devices have been introduced for axial and radial pressing of windings as they

are wound, as well as devices for pressing during drying of windings. This stabi-
lizes the dimensions and density of the winding. A number of lines are used for
cutting sheets of carboard. making piercing racks and spacers. Manufacture of
insulating components of complex configuration from celluloid and electrical-grade
cardboard has been mastered.

The reliability of high-voltage insulation for oil—filled transformers is determined
to a great extent by the quality of drying. Vacuum drying is the conventional
method for cellulose insulation. This process has been thoroughly worked out in
transformer plants. The vacuum in the drying ovens goes down to 0.1 mm Hg. The
conditions for heating up the active part before evacuation have been optimized.

A new method of drying in hydrocarbon vapor has now been adopted in Soviet trans-
former construction. In this technique. the active part of the transformer is
heated up by saturated or slightly supersaturated vapor of an organic liquid similar
to kerosene at a temperature of [ZS-140°C with subsequent vacuum drying at a residual
pressure of 0.1 mm Hg. The time for drying transformers in hydrocarbon vapor is

cut in half, and the quality of drying is improved.

Tests of power transformers are continually being improved for detection of flaws
in construction and manufacture.

For purposes of checking the quality of insulation in recent years. tests by commu-
tation pulse have been introduced. as well as protracted (hours-long) testing by
voltage on industrial frequency with measurement of the level of partial discharges
in insulation.

Work is continuing to perfect protection facilities and methods of troubleshooting
transformers during operation. The main protective insulation of high-voltage
transformers is the spark-gap arrester. The protective properties of this device
are principally what determines and limits the electric effects to which the trans-
former insulation is subjected. Therefore the improvement of arresters is one

of the decisive factors in raising the technical level of the transformers that
they protect. Another major protector of oil-filled transformers is the gas relay
that has been successfully used for 60 years.

At the present time. all transformers produced in our nation have gas relays made
in East Germany. the CEMA nation that specializes in making them.

Rubber containers in the expander keep the oil from getting wet and oxidizing.
Pointer-type indicators are used for checking the oil level.

New devices are now being developed for keeping track of the condition of trans-
formers during operation. These include a short-circuit counter that accounts

for the currents that act on the transformer over a prolonged period, using a special
sensor to monitor the temperature of the winding under load with fiberglass optics

to transfer the information to an external measuring device.

Among the new facilities for troubleshooting transformers. mention should be made
of an acoustic converter of partial discharges. This is a portable instrument
that can monitor intensity and determine the point of origin of partial discharges
in insulation during factory tests of transformers as well as under operating con-
ditions.

In recent years. a method of spotting initial damages by gases dissolved in the
oil has been widely used for troubleshooting transformers. The method is used
both by factory testers and operational personnel.

Experience in developing a 667 HVA transformer on 1150 kv, and feasibility studies
on transformer equipment with power up to 2000-2400 HVA have shown that a further
increase in unit power beyond 1000-1250 HVA will require development of assembly
plants with cranes having a hoisting capacity of more than 500 metric tons and

the necessary transport facilities. Moreover. the equipment for new superhigh-
voltage classes will require an increase in the level of technology and production
culture. as well as setting up the necessary test stands at the manufacturing plant.

To realize the prospects of development of transformer construction. and to satisfy
the needs of the electric power industry for maximum-power transformer equipment

at superhigh voltages, it has been decided to build a new transformer construction
shop at Zaporozh'ye Transformer Plant equipped with cranes having a hoisting capacity
of up to 1000 metric tons.

The new shop is being designed with a view to making transformers with voltages
up to 1800 kVAc and 21500 kVDC at unit powers of up to 3000 HVA.

The forthcoming Twenty—Sixth Congress of the CPSU will give new jobs to the energy
workers of the nation. The subsector of transformer construction must make its
contribution in handling these jobs. Cumulative production experience, the scien-
tific and engineering background and the availability of highly skilled specialists
inspire confidence that these problems will find a timely solution.

[Text] The need for using manipulators with programmed control (industrial robots)
is currently becoming more and more apparent in many types of plants. However.

the capabilities for using manipulator models now under development for large-
scale automation is restricted by the fact that they are being designed as indi-
vidual structures.

In this book. based on aystematization of the range of problems covering the field
of robotics as a whole, the authors demonstrate the feasibility of classifying
industrial manipulators. arranging them in unified-design series. and standardizao
tion. which will aid not only in expanding their range of application. but also

in simplifying design. shortening development time and reducing cost.

[Text] Problems of analyzing and synthesizing nonlinear gyroscopic systems of
arbitrary order on the basis of frequency methods are explained. The main atten-
tion is devoted to exposition of the results of investigating self-excited gyro-
scopic system oscillations caused by dry friction in cardan suspension axles. play
in mechanical transmission, dead zones, limiting and hysteresis in control cir-
cuits. etc. The results of investigating the stability of gyroscopic systems

with nonlinear elastic and elastic-dissipative coupling are analyzed. Specific

examples according to the applied theory of nonlinear oscillations of gyroscopic
systems are given.

The book is intended for engineers involved with gyroscopic systems.

Foreword

A great deal of work has been devoted to the solution of nonlinear problems of the
dynamics of gyroscopic systems (GS). However, this work in limited either to the
framework of precision movement, or to insignificant "smooth" nonlinearities.
Neither such nonlinear phenomena as self-excited oscillation nor problems of the
stability of significantly nonlinear 68 have been treated sufficiently in the
literature.

The main direction of the book involves investigation of self-excited oscillation

processes caused by the nonlinear nature of the elastic-dissipative coupling in

the mechanical part of GS and the nonlinear nature of the amplifying and con-
verting circuit of the control cOupline.

wide fluctuation of perturbing effects and of CS parameters can cause the
excitation of self-sustained oscillations with unacceptable amplitude and
frequency which often result in a nonstandard GS operating condition.

Since there is now no general way to determine the asymptotic stability of
nonlinear systems as a whole. and since instability is manifested in practice

in the form of self-excited oscillations. finding the conditions for self-
excited oscillation is one of the basic problems of 68 planning. Furthermore.
it is necessary to establish both the fact that self-excited oscillations occur
and be able to change the parameters of the system. as well as its structure if
need be, in order to eliminate the self-excited oscillations or change their
parameters in the required direction if a self-excited oscillating condition is
standard for the cs. It is important to know how a particular real nonlinearity
affedts the dynamic properties of the system. how to compensate for the harmful
influence of "parasitic" nonlinearities and how best to use the positive proper-
ties of nonlinear elements as concomitant as well as specially introduced
elements.

In this connection, the problem arises of discovering the general mechanisms

by which the influence of various nonlinearities is felt and of developing
recommendations to improve dynamics which do not involve specific system param-
eters or the placement of the nonlinear element within the GS structure.

The basis of the problems which are solved is'a'dynamic model of a multichannel
as with arbitrary placement of the gyroscopss, which makes it possible to allow
for the nonlinear nature of elastic and elastic-dissipative coupling between

the kinematic branches and elements of kinematic pairs. In contrast to existing
models of nonlinear coupling between elements of a kinematic pair with play,

the proposed model allows for omnidirectional properties of the nonlinear branch.
the input and output of which change as a function of the state of the energy
levels of the parts of the system separated by a gap.

Among nonlinearities, dry friction. which significantly degrades GS accuracy and
reliability. deserves special attention. A great deal of work. which is reviewed
in detail by N. V. Butenin [ll]. has been devoted to its influence on the opera-
tion of gyroscopic devices. However, most of the work devoted to the influence
of friction on OS stability investigates special problems corresponding to the
stable region of a nonlinear as. The natural outcome of these investigations was
confirmation of the damping effect of dry friction on a system within the indicse
ted region of the 68 phase space. In addition, consideration. e.g.. of the
inertial properties of an amplifying circuit makes it possible to detect the de-
stabilizing effect of dry friction, i.e., to discover the self-excited oscilla-
tion region located within the stability region of a linear system. Furthermore,
for 68 with dry friction and a doubly astatic driven linear part, there is no
stable region, since dry friction unavoidably causes self-excited oscillations.

Another important nonlinear factor which exerts a destabilizing influence on cs,
and usually causes self-excited oscillations, is play in mechanical transmissions.
The problems associated with investigating the influence of play on the dynamic
properties of cs have been far from exhausted, particularly in connection with

58

FOR'OFFNJA1.USE(NVLY

the inadequacy of the mathematical model of play. The arsenal of methods for
suppressing self-excited oscillations is also insufficient. In addition, the
influence of other concomitant nonlinearities of passive coupling on the dynamic
characteristics of 68 with play has been little studied.

Yet another series of important problems of CS dynamics involves nonlinearities

of the measurement and amplifier-converter circuit of control coupling with their
influence on the stability and precision characteristics of CS. as well as the
effect of cross-influence between concomitant nonlinearities of active (control)
coupling and passive elastic-dissipative coupling of the mechanical part of a

CS. The combined influence of several nonlinearities on the dynamic character-
istics of CS has been far from completely studied. Only the first steps have been

made in this direction.

The difficulty of the problem is the limited capabilities of existing methods of
studying nonlinear systems. Precise methods are valid only for the simplest
cases in which the order of the equations does not exceed 2 or 3. and are inap-
plicable in the case of the complex dynamic model of high-order GS.

The simplest, and sufficiently precise, approximate method is the harmonic
linearization method developed by Ye. P. Popov. which has recently become wide-
spread because of its exceptional simplicity and effectiveness [55]. However.

a condition for applicability of the harmonic linearization method is filtering
properties of the reduced linear part. which are often not satisfied for 68.
Examples of CS with an unfiltered linear part are systems with dry friction, sys-
tems with tachometric feedback, etc.. in which the order of the numerator of the
reduced linear part is less only by unity than the order of the denominator.

as well as systems with clearly defined resonance properties and low-frequency
(pre-resonant) periodic conditions. The formal application of the harmonic
linearization method in these cases may yield quantitative errors and even
qualitatively incorrect results [51. 96, 97]. In addition, a special type of
periodic movement-so-called slippage or stop motion-caused by jumps in the
derivatives of the argument of the nonlinear function is characteristic for CS

with dry friction. The presence of jumps at the input of the nonlinear element
makes it unjustified to apply the harmonic linearization method to the investiga-

tion of periodic solutions, if only because the form of the oscillations is
significantly nonsinusoidal. In connection with this. one of the chapters (the
third in the present book) is devoted to developing a method for investigating
nonlinear systems with an unfiltered linear part which can be used to conduct
qualitative investigations of distinct types of periodic conditions-slipping,
partially slipping and self-sustained oscillating conditions with stop-which

are not subject to investigation using the first harmonic method, and to investi-
gate periodic modes in critical cases of low oscillation amplitude to which the
applicability conditions of the harmonic linesrization method do not extend,

being based on estimating the sensitivity of a periodic solution to higher harmonics

and small parameters.

Finally, the problem of increasing the precision characteristics of CS is
inseparably associated with the problem of damping their oscillations which,
as we know, consists of the incompatible requirements of high static and dynamic

accuracy on the one hand, and stability on the othsr. furthermore, increasing
the damping moments with respect to cardan suspension axles and improving the
stabality of 68 simultaneously degrades its constrained motion characteristics.
The elastic compliance of construction elements further exacerbates this problem,
since additional resonant frequencies appear. Furthermore. if these resonant

frequencies are close to one another. it is extremely difficult to provide good
stabilization throughout the entire frequency range with the help of linear
correcting devices in the feedback circuit. The problen of synthesizing nonlinear

correcting couplings which improve the dynamic properties of the system arises
in this connection.

The book also considers control processes in GS in which a self-excited oscil-
lation condition is normal.

Problems of nonlinear dynamics of 68 are solved in the book on the basis of
frequency methods, particularly the harmonic linesrieation method, which have
recommended themselves in engineering practice.

The book is based on the author's work on the dynamics of nonlinear CS [83, 86,
97].

[Text] The problem of setting up programmed motions of a controlled object about
its center of mass is currently of considerable practical interest in connection
with the intensive development of modern technology. Resolution of this problem
involves either construction or closure of a system of equations of motion control
with respect to a given special solution (Ref. 1. 2]. The stability of such solu-
tions can be ensured by constructing a stabilization system that is optimum in
some sense [Ref. 4. S. 6].

The use of Euler-Krylov angles for determining the orientation of a solid in space
precludes the creation of a non-Cardan orientation system based on integrating

the equations of motion. This is due to degeneration of kinematic equations at
certain values of the angles of orientation. The use of direction cosines leads

to a considerable increase in the order of the system of the equations of motion.

In such a case it is most convenient to use quaternions, and specifically Rodrigues-
Hamilton parameters [Ref. 1] as the orientation parameters.

Let us consider a method of producing stable programmed notions about the center

of mass of a solid moving in a central force field. We will take the Rodrigues-
Hamilton parameters as the orientation parameters. In this way when angular veloci-
ty sensors and computers are available we can create a mathematical "platform"

as a result of integrating nondegenerate kinematic equations. The actuating ele-
ments of the control system are three one-degree gyroscopes with axes lying along
the principal axes of inertia of the entire system.

Let us introduce the following coordinate systems as shown in the diagram: inertial
CX1X2X3. principal central Oxlsz3 fixed to the solid, orbital Oxgpngxgp, and
the system of axes 0:15:53 in translational motion along the orbit.

The problem of stabilization of the resultant programd motions should be solved

closed form for the problem of optimum stabilization for the complete system of
nonlinear equations of motion of the object. closed by control. in perturbations.
Such a capability is due to the fact that the second members of the equations of
motion in perturbations. written in normal Cauchy form, are polynomials with a

Construction of optimum stabilization by the proposed method guarantees existence
of a positively defined function that satisfies the conditions of the Lyapunov

[Text] The problem of determining angular velocity. linear acceleration and other
motion parameters of a base from the output signals of gyroinertial indicators

can be treated as the inverse problem of gyroinertial measurement systems. The
conventional approach to solution of the inverse problem of gyroinertial measurement
systems [Ref. 6] that assmes utilization of the inverse equations of gyroinertial
measurement systems requires verification of conditions of stability and applicabil-
ity in accordance with D. R. Herkin for the solutions of these equations. and also
exact assignment of the initial values of the parameters to be determined. In

this paper. an approach to solution of the inverse problem of gyroinertial measure-
ment systems is proposed that is based on optimum estimation theory.

taining N indicators (gyroscopes, accelerometers). The location of each indicator
with respect to coordinate system Oxlsz3 fixed to the base is determined by radius

describe motion of an arbitrary system of this kind (Ref. 6] are represented in

y -h(xa.1) +£(l). (1.4)
where t(t) is the vector of random measurement errors.

The problem of estimating the vector of state x;(t) of system (1.3), (1.4) is a
standard problem of nonlinear filtration [Ref. 8]. If we assume that h-Iqo and

go. do are negligibly small (or their values are measured), while the dimensionality
of qo is not less than that of the vector xa- (x7. iT)T, then on the basis of (1.1)
we can get a nonlinear regression model of the form

2 I: (1:. 1') -l- Ed!)- (1-5)

An algorithm for estimating vector x; from observed vector 2 is to be found in
particular in Ref. 1.

2. Consider a gyroinertial-measurement system made up of two unbalanced electro-
static gyroscopes. With consideration of Ref. 2. 3. the averaged equations that
describe the motion of an aspherical unbalanced rotor of an electrostatic gyroscope

Let us consider the problem of reconstructing the instantaneous values of projec-
tions of the apparent acceleration wi andabsolute angular velocity mi. and also

the direction coaines d1g of coordinate system Oxlxzxa relative to inertial basis
111313 associated with t e vectors of kinetic moments of the electrostatic gyroscope
at the initial instant t- to ("true" direction cosines) from observations 21(t)

(i- l, 2..... Z). In the general case this problem reduces to a problem of non-
linear filtration for a system described by equations of form (1.2), Poisson equa-
tions for matrix DI-Idijl. and also equations of form (2.1) and relations (3.1)

for both gyroscopes.

A simpler scheme for solving the investigated inverse problem involves the following
operations:

1) obtaining preliminary estimates of components of the apparent acceleration V1
and the direction cosines of the vectors of kinetic moments a91 (rx- 1, 2) (n is
the number of the electrostatic gyroscope);

2) compensating the drift of the electrostatic gyroscope and constructing a prelimi-
nary estimate of the matrix of "negative" direction cosines D-Ildijﬂ [Ref. 9];

3) smoothing the preliminary estimates of projections of the apparent acceleration
and the "true" direction cosines, and estimating the projections of absolute angular
velocity.

Still another version of the algorithm of smoothing of vector x, can be obtained
