RBSEARCN CENTER PLANS T0 PRODUCE NUCLEAR REACTORS
Bratislava NOVE SLOVO in Slovak No 6b, 2 Nov 78 p 5

[Article by Peter Pribyl: "Our Atomic Town-—The Activity of the Nuclear
Research Institute in Rea"l

[Text] Since 1957 when the first Czechoslovak nuclear reactor was put into
operation in Re: near Prague that "atomic town" has become well known both
in our country and abroad. It is true that since that time the nuclear
research base has spread and our first atomic power plant was built in
Jnslovske Bohunice, soon to be followed by V-l and v-2 nuclear plants. Rez,
or rather the Nuclear Research Institute located in Rea. ceased to have a
monopoly on nuclear science in Czechoslovakia. Nevertheless, it is still
the largest research center for nuclear reactions and a source of incentives
in this field of science which has not been sufficiently explored.

Safety Above All

According to the conclusions of the CEHA Permanent Commission for Atomic
Energy and according to the program for cooperation of the CEHA member states
in the field of nuclear power. in l981-l98b Czechoslovakia plans to produce
10 complete reactors for the USSR and 8 for our domestic use. The reactors
will be of the VVER-bbo type. while higher-capacity reactors (VVBR-lOOO)

will be manufactured in the USSR. From reports in our press on the Czech-
oslovak nuclear program.we are informed how the preparations for the
production of components for nuclear reactors have progressed in the Shade
works in Plzen, in Vitkovice. etc. Although their production is based on
Soviet designs, gradual improvements and innovations will be introduced

(they are alreadybeing introduced nowb-in the stage of their ongoing develop-
ment) by Czechoslovak technicians and workmen from the manufacturing enter-
prises and from nuclear research centers. A "firsthand" impact of the
nuclear program is thus felt in Rez.

we expect that in the future, after 1985. the vvsa-1ooo reactors will also be
produced in our country. so to say, after some experience with them in the

USSR. however. even before that, the experts in Re: will deal with the
solution of moreUPRentand vital problems.

1
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

Among them is the problem of protecting the environments of nuclear power
plants against accidental breakdown of the reactor. Reactors operating

in the world are protected by such safety features that in the estimate

of experts the probability of a breakdown is in fact extremely remote: with
1.000 reactors in operation in the world. only One of them would break down
in 100 years...Even then. however. the contamination which would spread from
it would have extrtmely pernicious and tragic consequences. Therefore,
nuclear research workers everywhere in the world are working on methods for
prevention of contamination in case of a real breakdown. In the West such a
solution has been found in so-cslled "full-pressure containment.” Soviet
experts developed the so-called "bubbling cycle." which includes. among other
things. anenclosureof the primary and secondary systems of the reactor in
reinforced concrete casing. Our researchers developed the system of the
so-cslled "double container" around the reactor inwhichthe fission takes
place. It is basically an inner steel packing built around the area of the
reaction. which is wrapped in an outer container made of reinforced concrete,
with filters between both cycles. with monitored sealing of both containers.
etc. The CSSR offered this solution to the Soviet Union because nuclear
power plants are being built there as well as in our country in areas with
relatively high density of population, and according to the calculations by
our experts, the double container method provides an efficient protection
against contamination in such conditions.

Growing Pains

It is a fact that Czechoslovak industry did not have to start from zero in

the implementation of its nuclear program. However. when compared with the
challenges of the traditional steam or water power engineering, the challenges
of nuclear engineering are so desanding that they may cause problems during
the transition to new technologies. For instance. it is absolutely necessary
to rebuild the steel works and to develop completely new types of special
steel for the construction of even more advanced model 460 reactors. In

that connection the Nuclear Research Institute in Re: has participated in

deVeloping steel for the pressure container of the reactor (it is undergoing
tests this year).

Although the Nuclear Research Institute has been operating for more than

20 years, it is just beginning. if we consider that the whole nuclear age is
still before us. No wonder that in its research work the institute is still
encountering problems which may be regarded as its "childhood diseases."
however, if such diseases are not "treated" properly and become chronic and
protracted. they might turn into serious afflictions in maturity. The
institute is struggling because of a lack of technical equipment to be
delivered by the Machinery and Automation Plants, Tesla and other enterprises.

Naturally, for its highly specialized work it needs highly specialized
instruments which must be individually crafted or manufactured in llmllsd

lots. The manufacturing enterprises. however. are interested In larnv
quantities because they make it easier for them to meet their plans. At
present the Tesla national enterprise in Vrable has designated one of its
plants for the manufacture of instruments for nuclear research and the
Machinery and Automation Plants is planning the construction of new capacities.
among other things. also for the above-mentioned type of equipment.

Moreover, it is encouraging that a new research-production organization for
the manufacture of model and limited-lot equipment for nuclear research will
be built in Slovakia; it will be managed by the Czechoslovak Commission for
Atomic Energy. About 150 employees will work in that center for which space
has been provided in Spisska Nova Ves.

Unrestricted Cooperation

The Nuclear Research Institute in Re: near Prague has been closely cooperating
for a long time with similar institutes in other CEHA countries.

It has cooperated most closely and for the longest time with Soviet institutions.
That is the basis for most of the activities in the Nuclear Research Institute.
The Institute takes part in supplying--developing. planning. innovating.

testing. retesting. calculating. etc-Czechoslovak equipment for the Soviet
nuclear program. Thus, for example. it participated in the deliveries of

steam generators for the atomic power plants in the town of Shevchenko

in the Ukraine.

"hen completed. additional power plants which will be built in that Soviet
republic with the aid of other CEHA countries will supply those countries
with power. The CSSR is interested in that construction as well as in the
purchase of power; pertinent negotiations and considerations are therefore
reflected in the activities of the institute in Res.

Contacts with capitalist partners are taking place within the International
Agency for Atomic Energy of which the already mentioned Czechoslovak Commission
for Atomic Energy is a member. For instance, our neighbor, Austria, has
problems similar to ours (a lack of other kinds of energy) and also intends

to concentrate more intensively on nuclear energy; it is building a nuclear
power plant in Tulln on the Danube. Discussions on joint air-pollution
control. particularly in the border areas. water control. etc, are under way.

Only Reactors Are Involved

The Nuclear Research Institute is a place for explicitly applied research.
Its achievements affect increasingly more economic sectors and departments.
Activities or processes developed in Re: have gained for our national economy

annual profits or savings amounting to tens of millions of Res. and that amount
is still growing.

For instance. while adopting the process of nuclear reaction. a technological
method for reprocessing of deteriorated nuclear fuel was developed; it is
based on the use of gaseous fluorine and hydrogen fluoride. Moreover.
several "nonnuclear" applications were discovered during that process. among
them a facility for cleaning synthetic diamonds. This method has already
been applied in the Frame: national enterprise in Sumpsrk. The number of
technological processes applying from the very beginning of the development
of nuclear technology for nonnuclear purposes is constantly growing.

Agriculture: The so-callad Dewar's flask used for insemination of cattle
are now produced by the machine-tractor station in Ricany.

Food industry: The Nuclear Research Institute irradiated scores of quintals
of potatoes and onions for the Research Institute of Agricultural Technology
in Prague and for the Research Institute of Food Industry in Bratislava
to prevent the vegetables from sprouting and thus. to prolong their storage.
Mushrooms were irradiated from the Hyeological Institute in Prague. The

radiation did not affect thetasteof these foods and substantially prolonged
the period during which they stayed fresh.

Medicine: Radiopharmaceutical drugs are produced in Rea. Since 1975, the
l31-J agent (containing iodine) has been distributed in hospitals all over
Czechoslovakia. This agent has replaced painful examination processes and
facilitates more precise diagnosis. The presence of the l3l-J radioisotope

helps observe the conditions and function of this or that organ in the human
body (kidney. liver, etc).

Conservation and restoration of cultural treasures: The so-called bionegs-
tive effects of radiation are becoming increasingly more useful in extermina-
tion of ligniperdous insects in valuable wooden artifacts in museums. churches.
etc. In its large-capacity radiation source the institute has treated

painted panels. wooden statues and other valuable objects of immense financial
and artistic value which would be otherwise destroyed by the ”ravages of time."
In its approach to cultural treasures the institute has found a particularly
resourceful partner in the Central Bohemia Museum in Rostoky near Prague

which has built its own radiation chamber with a cobalt emitter for the
treatment of precious collections.

Naturally, the application of methods developed in Re: is not spreading
uniformly in every field and department. It has found relatively very rapid
application in medicine and the rubber industry as well as in the manufacture

of cables. while its progress in the chemical industry has been relatively
slou. This is somewhat startling, since next to mechanical and power

engineering, cheniatry is exactly the field fron which we shall deusnd

increasingly larger quantities and higher quality of products, and that
cannot be acconplished without modern technology.

input and Output Unit for Elastic Disks EC 5075

This is designed for direct data transmission from an elastic disk into
the computer and vice versa. In analogy with card-punching equipment.
it replaces the reader and key punch which are connected on-line with
the processor.

The unit consists of the recording medium on the elastic disk (EC 5076).
elastic disk changer and control unit. including the buffer and port.

The elastic disk consists of the recording medium. which is permanently
placed in a plastic sleeve. The surface of the recording medium is di-
vided into 77 tracks. 73 of which are usually reserved for the user's
data. Each track has 26 sections and each section contains one block of
fixed length. A total of 128 bits is reserved for data in every block.
The track capacity thus is 3,328 hits and the capacity of the entire disk
242.966 bits and corresponds to the contents of 1.900 punched cards.
input rate is 3.600 blocks and output rate 2,200 blocks per minute.

EC 5075 equipment can work only with the elastic disks initialized in
advance. by which is meant that at least the section identifier must be
recorded in advance in each section.

The automatic elastic disk changer permits replacement of a maximum of

20 disks without the operator's intervention. The cycle of inserting the
elastic disk from the storage bin into the module and its replacement
into the storage bin takes 5 minutes. The disks must be withdrawn from
storage in the same order they were filed.

‘rwo mculeia of EC 5075 equipment will be available: as control unit

with one elastic disk changer or as control unit with two independent
elastic disk changers (Fig 3).

--cyc1ical voltametry or

~-dltferentinl pulsating dissolvingvoltametryivith semi-automatic operation.

To the instrument belongs a flat coordinate recording instrument X? 5103
which permits recording of function y - E (x) and. after hooking up the
time base to the input clamps of the coordinate x or y. also the recording
of functions y - f (t) or x - E (t).

The coordinate recording instrument is primarily designed for work in com-
bination with the polarographic analyzers. but is applied also in the
analog and hybrid computer centers, research and development laboratories,
development bases of production plants. centers for data processing and
statistics. testing and measuring laboratories, and so on.

Limited Capacity Level indicator SHL

This instrument is used for measuring the minimum and maximum levels of
loose. granular or liquid substances. electrically conductive or noncon-
ductive. aggressive or nonaggressive which are placed in various types
of storage bins: bunkers. silos, reservoirs and the like. The complete

SHL set consists of a suspended or stick probe and evaluation equipment
V2".

The mechanical part of the probe consists of the electrode with an alu-
minum head and an electronic reader in the head of the electrode. The
change in the capacity between the probe and storage bin wall caused by

26
ron omcm. use ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

change in the level of material measured produces a change in the output
direct current or the probe which is fed into the input clamps of evalua-
tion equipment V2“. This signal is amplified in the integrated differen-
tial amplifier of evaluation equipment and carried to the flip-flop
circuit. In the collector of the terminal translator of the flip-flop
circuit there is the coil of the relay which closes when the current

from the probe equals zero. Hhen the capacity changes because the elec-
trode is surrounded by the medium measured. the relay is deactivated.

The suspended and stick probes can be placed in the spaces with the tem-
perature of the environment surrounding the probe head ranging from minus
25 to plus 70 degrees Celsius. relative humidity from 30 to 80 percent.
and working environment T2 according to CSN [Czechoslovak State Standard]
03 8805 and CSN 34 568i. Evaluation equipment V2“ can be placed in sim-

ilar spaces except that maximun temperature of the surrounding environ-
ment must not exceed plus 65 degrees Celsius.

Capacity indicator SHL consists of spark-resistant equipment. Completely
sparkproof stick or suspended probes have been designed for the environ-
ment in which the danger of potential explosion corresponds to the hydro-

gen class of spark inflammability and to the second class of spark safety
according to CSN 36 1699.

Evaluation equipaent V2" with a sparkproof output for feeding the elec-

tronic part of the probe is placed in the environment where there is no
danger of an explosion.

Stick probes weigh 1.8 kg and suspended probes l m long weigh approximately
7 kg. Evaluation equipment VZH weighs 2.5 kg.
