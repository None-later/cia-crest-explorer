it hes no effect either on the fore of the field of nodes of propegetion or

does not depend on the transverse dimensions of the airrors. and for typical
experimental situations is quite small. For instance when L-l a, x-l us:
the half-width 0° -o.25 cu. 'lb soee extent, this circunstance probably
places under doubt the advisability of using eu‘ch cavities in lasers with
large transverse dimensions of the active Iodine. nonetheless. in our view

th. use of cavities with m airrors for pulse lasers any be considered
sound.

In actuality. with large transverse dimensions of airrors t can he expected
that the solutions of (10) with functions {(30 that have characteristic
dimensions less than the airror size a and that vary fairly smothly with
respect to the transverse coordinate within the liaits of this dimension
will be approxinats solutions of equation (2a). or in other words will be
approximate nodes of oscillations of the cavity. here the tern "approximate
nodes of oscillations of the cavity" is understood to nean that the form of
the field described by such functions with satisfaction of stipulated con-
ditions will be practically duplicated on the nirrors over the extent of a
large ember l of passes through the cavity. ‘lhe nunber of passes I for
pulse lasers say be greater than the nmber of panes of emission over the
length of the cavity during a lasing pulse. and then such an epproxinete
node of oscillations will be practically realizable.

‘lhus for pulse lasers in addition to the problen of finding the exact solution
of equation (2a) the question arises of studying the nature of the change in
approximate solutions (10) of equation (as) depending on the fore of the
function ﬁx). the transverse dinensions a of the nirror and the nusber ll

of passes. and as far as we know this problem has no analogs in the conven-
tional theory of open resonators. Probably the consideration of such a
pnoblen will in future be the basis of research on the theory of cavities
with m mirrors.

In conclusion, let us consider the problem of the influence that optical
immonogeneities have on the node structure of fields in a cavity with m
airrors. In doing so. we limit ourselves to nedia for which the index of
refraction n depends on the coordinate according to the law

It is known [Ref. 1. 8] that in this case the optical properties of the
nediun located between the mirrors can be described by a transfer aatrix:

V. I"! At tiae sero it was assumed that the ten-

peratures of sy-etric and deforaation nodes
of co; were equal; however. in the lesing
process consideration was taken of the dif-
ference in these tenerntures caused by the
heavy flux of quanta to level 100 of the
syuetric node of 00;. Zero gain implies
equality of the populations of the upper and
lower laser levels. we initial gas ten-
perature was taken as equal to the wall
tsnerature. and the initial intensity was
taken as equal to that of spontaneous

it is necessary to deter-nine the initial
populations of the vibrational levels of
nitrogen and the antisymmetric node of mg.
Lack of information on the electron distri-
bution function for the air-002 nixture
precludes deteraination of the initial
populations of vibrational levels fron the
current-voltage curve of the discharge.
'nberefore the initial populations of nitrogen
levels and the antisy-etric node of 003
were deter-lined by cclparing a reference
enission pulse with the experinentally
‘ neasured pulse for given values of the

rate of rotational exchange the long oonponent of the miles, since the
foraer is deter-lined chiefly by the vibra-
tional tenperature of the antisy-etric node of €01, while the latter is
detenined by the vibrational tenperature of nitrogen. It was found that the
equilibriu distribution by rotational levels during lasing does not settle
down instantaneously. and accounting for the rate of rotational exchange is
essential for proper calculation of pulse shape.

 

Pig. 5 shows an experiaentally neasured enission pulse. and pulses calculated
with and without consideration of the finite rate of rotational exchange
(Ref. 10]. it can be seen that accounting for the finite rate of rotational
exchange leads to bnoadening of the spike and eliainates the disegreenent
between the calculated and experinentally aeasured emission pulse shapes

that was noted in Ref. 9. ll.

For pure 002 the energy balance was compared with the results of calculation
in Ref. 13. As can be seen from Table 2, the discrepancy uoes not exceed 10!.
when the percentage of (I); in the mixture is leps than 705, discharge
efficiency varies little with the composition of the mixture. and reaches 603,
which is only 20$~lower than for mixtures with a high as content (Ref. lb].

The ﬂaction of the emitted energy out of the maximum possible (now) was
less than b2! in all experiments. An appreciable part of the snare! at the
instant of cessation of lasing, as implied by the calculations. remains
stored in vibrations of nitrogen and the antisymmetric mode of (1);. which
can be attributed to a growth in population of the lower laser level as a
result of gas heating. As shown by the results of calculations presented
in Table 3. reduci the initial gas temperature enables us to raise he"

A maximum pulse duration of 80 us is realized experimentally with 2.11 co;

in the mixture. In this case 8; I0.83 J. To increase the pulse duration
further it is necessary to reduce the percentage of mg in the mixture.

As implied by calculations, at a a); fraction in the mixture of 1.11.

t I150 us. and when the fraction is 15, 1 1-250 us. In doing this. to

maintain the laser efficiency on a constant level it is necessary to increase
the length of the active medium and to raise the Q of the cavity.

The dependence of pulse parameters on the Q of the resonator for a mixture
with pressure of 11% n as and {C02} -13.31 is shown in Table Io (Urn-30 xv).
its absence of a drop in 8; at 320.9 that was observed in Ref. 6 can be
attributed to the fact that the coefficient of reflection of the opaque
mirror in our experiments was taken as 1905.

Ithus we have experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of regula' ing the
duration of a pulse emitted by a CO; laser on air-a); mixtures over a wide

range (from 0.1 to 80 us) by using the composition of the mixture and the
Q of the cavity.

ebsorption proper in the terget of the redietion thet hes pessed through

the plasme. In the second plece the terget is heeted through direct theresl
contact with the plssne hosted by the redietion; in this case the heeting of
the terget is determined to e greet extent by the geometry of the problem.
for instence if the plasea of sir breskdown is crested on lerge expooure
spots. heeting of the motel tsrget tskes plece chiefly ecross the eree of
the spot (not. 1]. In the third plece, dispersal of the plssma with
formetion of e shock weve in the sebient gee mev lend to considerable
edditionel heeting of the tergst across sections of its surfece thet ere
fsirly distent from the exposure spot (Ref. 2. 3].

m- peper. which is e continuetion end development of Ref. 2. is devoted

to the study of the basic principles thet govern hosting of metel targets

in sir by pulsed co, leeer emission mder conditions of epprecisble influence
of plasma dispersal on the mechsnism of host transfer. Also investigeted are
cases of reduced sir pressure end eir-vscuum transition where there are
chsnges in the properties of the plssma initieted close to the tsrget:

the plssme of sir breskdown is trensformed to a vepor Jet of tsrget
meteriels. ‘

In both ceses e "site” effect is observed ~- the dependence of the velue of

target for a given emission intensity.

drop as I“. According to he data presented in Pig. f the experinental ’
mnctign A(I) differs m- um predicted by forum (2) and cm. the torn
AII' . This difference is apparently the result of two causes. In the
first place. in experiments 'vith nicrosecond 002 laser pulses the vaporization
of netals as a rule is accompanied by vapor breakdown. vhich should lead to
.dditional heating of the netal due to thermal contact with the vapor plasna.
In the second place, the laser pulse is close to triangular in shape. and
therefore the enery in the "tail" of the pulse vhere eniasion intensity is
no longer adequate for target vaporization should be absorbed in the plasna
once acre with efficiency -A(Iy.p). .

‘lhe ”size" effect -- dependence of A on R1 - is due to spatial dispersal

of the plasna and additional heating of the target across peripheral sections
of the surface outside of the exposure spot. 'ib sake certain that it is the
dispersal of the vapor cloud into vacuum that is responsible for this effect,
we neasured the thermal response of an additional copper plate located to the
side of the axis of the las'er been at a distance R1 >3. with its surface
(area about 13 sq. In) facing the plans. Pig. 3 shovs thermal response A

[Article by I. I. Artanonov. V. A. Barikhin. V. V. Borovkov and V. I. Kashin-
tsov

[hart] Analytical expressions are obtained that describe
the operation of an inductive accuulator into a load

that contains inductance and resistance. It is shown

that a reduction in the inductance and resistance of the
load increases the energy dissipated in the load and the
tins of energy release. while an increase in inductance

and resistance reduces the energy and tins of its release.
An experinental check is done on theoretical calculations
besed on the exsnple of a laser using a solution or
Rhoda-ins 60 in ethanol with flash-tubs pulping. In

this check. the use of an inductive accunulator as the
puping source increased the output energy of the laser

by a factor or l.5 while shortening the pulse front oi’ the
stiaulated enission by a factor of 2.5 as conpared with the
paraneters of a laser with capacitive accunulator under the
sane conditions.

At the present tine nearly all the records being set for laser emission
para-eters are achieved on solid-state lasers. To a great extent. this is
the result of developaent of powerful electric discharge light sources with
capacitive accunulator supply. At the sane tine. light source requiresents
in the final analysis are deternined by the specifics of the working laser
transitions. and therefore the use of a given source or supply in each
specific case nust be based on the characteristics of the active nediu
rather than on the traditions that have evolved up to the given point in tine.

It has been nentionsd in the literature last. 1-3] that inductive acclnilators
(1A) have advantages when rapid input or stored enerc to a load is needed.
Data of theoretical calculations (Ref. 5, 6] show that it is advantageous

to use the IA for instance in dye lasers where the influence of the rate of
increase in excitation is quite appreciable.

1. Operation of the IA into a aimed load

Usually the IA consists of a storage circuit and a load circuit (Ref. 1]
connected in parallel. First the energy of the’ external source is stored
in the inductance of the storage circuit. the switch of the load circuit
being open. After the store'd energy hes reached a predeterained value.
the switch of the storage circuit is opened siaultaneouly with closing of
witch of the load circuit. and as a result the energy stored in the accu-
sulator inductance is partly or conpletely released in the load. which my
be either an inductance or a resistance. or both together. Usually elec-
tricelly exploding wires (nu) (Ref. 2] are used es the switches in the
storage circuit. and dischargers are used in the load circuit.

Up until now the process of energy transfer to the load has been calculated
in only two cases: for inductance without resistance. and for pure resistance
without inductance (Ref. 1. 3]. Either nunsricel nethods or qualitstive
representations have been used to describe the process of energy transfer

to a timed load. nevertheless. even in this case enelyticel expressions cen
be found that describe the principles governing transfer.

If the instant of operation of the switches is taken as the ties t-O of
beginning of readout. the process of euro trensfer to the load by anelogy
with Ref. 1 is described by the following system of differential equstions

L.i,+RI.-0. Lgig+flf-RI.-o. I‘-’p+'. a)

with initial conditions I.(0)- 1.), 13(0) '0. where I. is inductance. I is
current. R-ccnst is the pure resistance of the switch in the storage
circuit when t 00. r-const is the pure resistance of the land. the sub-
scripts 1-3 refer to the parameters of the storage circuit. the load circuit
end the switch of the storage circuit respectively. It should be esphssized
that systes (1) describes trensfer only for the cese R-const throughout
the process. The validity of this essunption in the renge of 10 ns-lO us

is shown by the experiaental data given in Ref. 1-5.

It is convenient to use direct Laplace transformation to convert system (1)
to a systea of algebraic equations in insge space:

LI lie-“(0) l+Rl,-0. L. ‘df‘lgm l+’l.-R‘.-o' ‘e-‘fi'hs (2)

and then to find the originals of the solution of this systes from s table

discharge circuit after transfer were due only to the iaperfection of the
recording system. or possible "pinching" of the discharge in the tube.

In the vereion with capacitive accunulator the pumping pulse duration at
half-height was 7.7 us. the stimulated emission pulse 3 us. end with the

IA - 2.2 and 3 us respectively (see Fig. 3). a typical plateau being observed
in this case in the vicinity of the mime of the lasing pulse (see Fig. 30).
which is in total sgreeaent with the conclusions of section 1 on the trape-
aoidal shape of the current pulse in the discharge circuit for saall x.

and :xperiaental results (see Fig. h). The absence of a plateau on the
oecillogrea of the pumping pulse (Fig. 36) can be attributed to the specifics
of the spectral characteristics of the F'EK-lh photocell (light filters were
not used in the experiments).

In operation with the capacitive accumulator stimulated emission arose
practically at the naxim current. lasing intensity reached the greatest
value within 8 us. after which a rapid drop began. although the current up
to this point did not have tine to change nuch (Fig. h). This shows the
high thresholds of oneet and interruption of lasing in the given instance.
One of the IA reduces the rise time of the lasing pulse to 0.? us. and
lasing arises practically simultaneously with the current in the load.

the energy in the pulse of stimulated emission increasing to 2.2 J an compared
with 1.5 J in the first variant. prinarily due to the reduction in rise time
of the pulping pulse. leading to a reduction in the threshold of onset of
stilsuleted eaission (Ref. 6).

Thus the use of an IA as the pumping source for a laser on a Rhodanine 66
dye solution increases the output energy of the laser and shortens the
duration of the lasing pulse front.

no problem of divergence of emission of a pulse-periodic laser is con-
siderably cuplicated by the spherical aberration of the heat lens, and its
exasination requires a more complex approach than that used in Ref. 1. It
can be concluded that with a reduction in 0 while retaining optima values
of Po and Q0 both the divergence of the radiation and its temperature
dependence Inst decrease. line results of divergence measurement as a
mnction of temperature for a number of glasses are shown in Pig. 10 (the
measure-eats were ads at a level of 25! of the total emission energy).
The temperature behavior for 01.322 glass agrees with the data of Ref. 1;
the divergence at the ainimu is close to the diffraction limit. The
value of the rate or change in divergence with temperature in the vicinity
of 50°C for nos-u glass is approximately 671 lover than for nos-I and
6:322 glasses, which agrees with the ratio or the values of 0 for these

with an increase in the input in an individual pulse above sone liniting
value Ho. Oasdynanic effects at such frequencies are insignificane.

In the other limiting case (very low energy inputs) the authors attribute
the limitation of prf to the presence of a boundary layer on.the electrodes.
At internsdiate values of H. the authors of Ref. 6 are of the opinion that
a decisive part is played by the increase in site of the heated gas plug due
to adiabatic expansion. Shock waves (8") are nentioned in the work. but
their role in prf linitation is not explained. Direct neasurensnts of the
degree of gas nonunifornity in the discharge region were not done in the
research. Istinates on adiabatic expansion are given for a specific

syst. with electrodes protruding into the flow. Calculations on boundary
layers are done approxinately without consideration of the actual traJectory
of notion of the particles in the layer; the increase in energy release at
the electrodes was not taken into consideration. and heat drift to the
electrode was estimated only with respect to order of nagnitude.

Ref. 7 discusses the possible influence of 63s arising in the gas channel
after pulsed energy input. i'he linitation of the prf is associated with the
entry of gas into the discharge region that has already been heated due to
dissipation of energy on the front of SVs propagating upstrean. Estimates
of this effect are not given in the article. and indirect proofs can be
interpreted in nore than one way. It is shown in Ref. 8 in particular that
gas heating upstrean due to dissipative processes is negligible.

In Ref. 9 a nunerical solution is found for equations of one-dinensional
unsteady gasdvnanics to deternine the nature of establish-ant of a quasi-

' steady state in a space closed for perturbation with gas flow with periodic
energ release. The nain conclusion of the work is: at a prf close to f0
we get a quasi-steady level of values of gas tenpersture and density in the
working channel that differ fro the undisturbed values by 10-3”. It
should be stated that nuerical nethods of solving this problen have not
yielded a physically clear solution. They are special in nature. and are
applicable to evaluation of the influence of wave processes only on a
specific installation.

Cur research is devoted to the study of gaadynuic phenomena that take
place in pulse-periodic lasers. and their effect on prf linitation.

see the electrode Bile that indicate ele-
vated energy release at the electrodes.
From the rate of propagation of the elec-
trode 8‘! we can estinate the gas tempera-
ture in the electrode layer. According
to estimates. at the cathode in nitrogen

in the electrode layer in 002 is still

Acoustic vaves propegate to the sides or the discharge. their intensity in

than the propagation of gasdvnanic perturbations to characteristic dis-
tances. and therefore vith {air accuracy the size of the heated gas plug
after expansion can be calculated by using the fomnas or the adiabatic

process:

Shovn in Pig. 5 are the tins dependences of change in gas density in the

of flow as determined tron processing of tine interference patterns. 'Ihe
redmtion in gas density is due to expansion vhen heated during discharge
or as a result of relaxation of the energy stored in the vibrational levels
of mlecular gases into heat. Restoration of the density to the original
value can be attributed to heat drift to the electrodes.

systaa. the coaposition and degree of renewal of the working
listure of a closed-cycle 003 process leser. resulting in
an increase in output power of the facility to 10 kit with
overall efficiency of the order of 8!.

1. An earlier paper (Ref. 11 told of the develop-em. of a stew-state
fast-flow closed-cycle 00; process laser with emission power of 6 h" in
which a self-aaintained transverse nc discharge was used for excitation of
the active Iediun. and enission was stimulated in a single-pass unstable
cavity located in direct proxiaity to the discharge chasber. As pointed out
in Def. 1. such an electro-optical arrangenent has fairly low efficiency
since the length of the discharge ch-ber. which it linited because of
relaxation processes. does not per-nit attainment of high specific (per unit
of mass) energy inputs 9‘. and the concoaitant low gain of the nediun in the
cavity for the actually realisable transparency of the latter (20-3)!) does
not pernit efficient transformation of the stored vibrational energy of
nolecules into emission.

, ‘ihis new can be alnost totally eliminated by using an electro-optical laser
arrangenent with a combined sultiple-pass cavity [not 2]. In the first
place. this obviates the liaitations inposed by collisional relaxation,
and the necessary values of "8 can be realized by increasing the length of
the chamber; in the second place, with an increase in the amber of passes
there is an increase in the optical length of the cavity. enabling operation
with greater transparency of the optical systen. laturally a large number
of passes in the cavity leads to an increase in the nunber of elenents in
the optical arrangenent, increases the energy losses on the nirrors and

[Text] To calculate the temperature of an irradiated
surface ﬁt). uperinental data are used on the behavior
of absorptivity A(t) of a copper target during the action
of a laser nonopulee. Pro: the Motion Mt) and i'(t)
the authors determine the temperature depenance of ab-
sorptivity MT) in the range of 300-6000 K for eeiesion
with wavelength of 1.06 an. The possibilities and lini-
tations of this kind of nethod of deternining MT) are
discussed.

Under normal conditions the reflectivity R of any netale is close to

unity. "hen intense optical radiation acts on the netal, the temperature
of the irradiated surface increases, which is anally scconpanied by a
reduction of R. Since the relative change in abeorptivity A-l-R new be
considerable in this case. the given effect nust be taken into consideration
in analysis of the interaction of intense radiation with metals [Ref. 1-3].

The reflectivity of netals under the action of laser radiation has been
experinentally studied in many papers (see Ref. 1-? and the references

cited there); however, very little is known as yet on the behavior of
reflectivity in the high-temperature region. Usually in experiments the
time change of aheorptivity A(t) is measured. and the telperature To of the
exposed surface renains unknown. In this research. the experinental curve
for Mt) tron Ref. 5 is used to calculate the surface tenperature of a copper
target. and the resultant function MT) is analyzed. In addition. an
examination is ends of the behavior of optical parameters in the case of

a transition of metal-dielectric type where the action of intense radiation
on the metal nay lead to an increase in reflectivity.

the region usO.12h and the subsequent break in the curve for Mu) are due
to the piecewise-linear approxination of the function Mt). which is an
admitted simplification. Nevertheless. this kind of behavior of Mu) is a
qualitative indication of the considerable change in the quantity dA/du on
the initial heating stage. Vith consideration of this circumstance it can
be assumed that the prohlea of discrepancy with data of Ref. 12 will be
explained with none detailed measunaent of the relation Mt) in laser
experiments.

A rapid increase in the coefficient of absorption when a coppcr target is
exposed to nillisecond laser pulses with wavelength of I .o,69 Ill and
intensity I 50.1 I‘M/cs2 is also reported in the recast research of Ref. 1):
(see Fig. 2). however. this paper does not give the relation of the coef-
ficient of absorption Mt) from which the curve for Mu) was reconstructed.
and there are no indications of an peculiarities in the initial heating
stage. he knee of the curve for Mu) in the vicinity of u cu; is at-
tributed in Ref. lb to the possibility of beginning of melting. which was
not considered in calculating the function u(t). ‘ihe thermophysical
parameters of copper were taken as constant in hef. lb.

Our calculations inply that nelting has little influence on the behavior

of u(t) since the latent heat of fusion q1lc'i' I0.l$ is relatively low.
Besides. some retardation in the growth of u(t) due to melting say be cc-
pensated by a reduction of thermal diffusivity in the nolten utal. ihe
reduction in thermal diffusivity with increasing temperature leads to
acceleration of surface heating. which corresponds to smoothing of the
relation Mu) for a predetermined function Mt). ‘nie necessity of accounting
for the reduction in x with temperature is also shown by the sharp change

in Mu) with attainnent of the minus value of 5-0.3? (curve 1. fig. 2)
that results with the assumption of a constant value of x 8m.

lhe thernal diffusivity of copper in the solid state decreases by a factor
of approximately 1.5 with a change froa room temperature to 1'1 (Ref. 10).
here is almost no information on the change in thermal diffusivity of
nolten copper with temperature. For exuple let us represent the relation
Mu) in the fora

‘ihe relations u(t) and Mt) for this case are shown in Fig. l (h) and 2 (2).
As a consequence of acceleration in the rise of u(t). the curve Mu) ap-
proaches the maxim- value of A. more smoothly than in the case x-xo.

In this connection. the snail change in Mt) after reaching the maximu- is
due to weakening of the temperature dependence of the coefficient of ab-
sorption Mt) at high temperatures “31.5. It can also be seen from a corn-
parison of curves 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 that when uzu; the temperann-e de-
pendence x(u) has a relatively weak influence on the quantity Mu). Let

us note that in this temperature region when the themphysical coe.'ficients

'ihe behavior of Mu) discussed up to thin point has corresponded to the
front of the curven for u(t). The temperature dependence Mu) found
similarly on the descent of the u(t) curves differs considerably from that
described above. the ”hysteresis" being particularly great for the case
x-xo. Formally. this circustance is caused by the very rapid reduction
of absorptivity Mt) on the trailing edge of the emission pulse. At
present it is difficult to drav any definite conclusions on the causes of
such behavior or Mu) that nay be due for instance to inaccuracy in the
measurement of Mt) (in Ref. 5 there is only a single experimental point
over the entire descent section of curve Mt)).

'lhe results found above shov the possibilities end disadvantages of the
method of determining the temperature dependence of the coefficient of
absorption Mu) from the laser curve of Mt). In the high temperature
region Vhere it is no longer possible to ignore the change in then;-
physical parameters. it becomes necessary to get additional data on the
behavior of the temperature of the irradiated surface u(t). "hen u 51 the
required infatuation can be obtained simultaneously with Mt) by measuring
the recoil pressure p(t). vhich is approximately half the saturated stea-
pressure p(t) e0.5pu[u(t)].

In viev of the sharp dependence of p" on u. the recoil pressure is quite
sensitive to change in surface temperature. In accordance with formula (2)
a recoil pressure of p - 200 bars corresponds to the maximun temperature
vhen x-xo (uﬂelﬁ, curve 3. Fig. 1). whereas the maximum recoil pressure
in the case of decreasing therml diffusivity X'Xl (at u,-2.11. curve I),
Fig. 1) reaches 720 bars. By the instant that curve Mt) reaches the
horizontal section. the recoil pressure in these cases is equal to 0.3 and
100 bars respectively.

'ihe pattern of interaction of intense radiation vith the target becomes
more complicated vhen an absorbing plasma layer develops over the surface.
The presence of such a layer precludes identification of the measured
value of Mt) vith absorptivity of the target surface. For this reason it
is necessary to monitor the instant of development of the plenum in the
experiment.

are influence of the plasma layer may be particular strong if the electron
concentration exceeds the characteristic value nptu xii/Inez, vhere e and

m are the charge and mass of the electron. For neodymium laser radiation

o; atoms at the surface of a copper target reaches such a value at T361400 K.
be appearance of a plasma layer limits applicability of the method of
determining the temperature dependence of the absorption coefficient of
metal Mu) from the experinental curve for Mt). Nevertheless, this uthod
enables a considerable advance into the still unstudied region of tem-
peratures of molten metals. In this connection. for pulse heating of

metal it is apparently advisable to use optical radiation with shorter
wavelengths. vhich my lead to considerable displacement of the boundary

[at us nov consider sone peculiarities in the behavior of the coefficient
of reflection that may occur in the case of a metal-dielectric transition.
l-nerical calculation [Ref. 15] show that in the transcritical vaporization
state when p > pc and there are no phase bomdaries. there say be a thin
dielectric interfaye r between the plasna and metal that has no appreciable
influence on the general pattern of interaction of radiation with the metal.
‘ihe problem of dielectrisation of mlten metal in the subcritical region
that has been discussed in the literature for sore than thirty years nov
has not yet been finally solved. It was assumed in Ref. 16-18 that such a
transition occurs fairly snoothly. and therefore one can disregard inter-
ference effects associated v'ith the development of additional interfaces

in the exposed material.

If the estal dielectric interface is not smoth. interference effects

cannot be disregarded. Direct manifestation of such effects is possible.

of course. only when there is fairly miform distribution of intensity over ‘
the exposure spot. Just as in the case of analysis of the behavior of Mu)
given above. this penits m to restrict ourselves to consideration of the
one-dimensional pattern of the process.

he transition region on the Intel-dielectric interface can be considered
optically sharp if its characteristic dimension h is small conpared vith
the wavelength of radiation in the media (hcl). For the visible range. this
means that h <0.l us. Since the scale of the drop in the temperature
profile in front of the transition interface in the quasi-steady state is
detox-lined by the speed of notion of this interface v2 and the thernal
diffusivity of the material x. the relative change in temperature in the
region of the transition is given by the relation n'rl'r, 8hvz/x. Ata

we get 61': 50 K. Thus at constant pressure if the tenperature width of the
metal-dielectric transition does not exceed a fev tens of degrees. and the
time required for such a transition is fairly short (t <h/vz). the netal-
dielectric interface N be optically sharp.

As we see. materials can be selected that satisfy the conditions of the
table. However. these conditions considerably restrict the the possibilities
of using the reversal effect due to resonantly punped aedia. In particular.
when wavefront reversal is used to conpensate inhomogeneities of the active
nediu of an anplifier it is necessary that frequencies coincide within the
limits of the amplification linewidth. For instance for neodyaius glass

we must have «5-», < 102 cm“. Gases require even closer agreement of
frequencies. Besides. the conditions of the table permit us to use the
reversal effect only in the wavelength range of x 2 3.2 un. 'ihese restrictions
would be removed in the case of strong saturation if the require-eat for
linear dependence of gain on the intensity of the signal to be reversed
could be avoided. Actually. vhen ozotloin. relation (6) of the table

takes the following forn:

At a saturation parameter of 10-100 both frequencies any fall within an
asplification linewidth of 2-20 cla' , and the long-wave boundary of repro-
duction is noved into the far infrared region.

One question reasins: is reproduction possible with pusping by a saturating
signal? Generally speaking. saturation. in saoothing out the gain dependence
of intensity should lead to distortion of the reproduced wavefront. however.
we can point out a case where saturation will not interfere with the repro-
duction process.

colpared with a mixture without 00,. In Ref. 12. atteapts to achieve
effective transfer on CO; in systens ”3-02-00; and ugh-02-00; were
unsuccessful.

The possible disagreement of these results is explained by the different
conditions of experilents (presence of inpurities in the initial cuponents.
different conditions of airing of reagents. initiation powers. tenperaturcs
and so forth). 0n the other hand. as shown in Ref. 1", the efficiency of
systeas with energy transfer passes through a Isaxisus with increasing
reaction rate. which is due to the change in initiation power; therefore
it is difficult torinterpret the results of experiments with addition of
co, to different chemical system. He studied the energy transfer DF-eCO;
in laser systess based on chlorine fluorides. The purpose of the work was
to clarify the way that transfer efficiency depends on the kind of initial
chlorine fluoride. the lechanisn and kinetics of for-stion of DP. which
differ for different nelecules of Clio. The results are coapared with
data on the transfer Diem; for the systen onbz-Oozoﬂe.

caloriseter with recording of the lasing pulse by a GeAu sensor and an
88-11 oscilloscope. The gases Cit; and €175 were purifed by distillation
in vacuum Cl! was produced froa Cl), and 012 by heating an equi-olar
sixture to ”0°C. The reaction was initiated by flash photolysis of the
airtures. The presence of P2 in the chlorine fluorides was checked fro.
the intensity of the band l¢0 of D? caission in control experinents:

in the presence of I; this. band is of low intensity or is absent due to
the for-tion of DIM when r, is "burned out."

Inlet of the sixture into the tube and sizing were done with constant
circulation to avoid thernsl reactions. In experinents with Iixtures of
13-02 and rz-nz-oo; at pressures below the upper linit. the laser tube was
cooled by a stress of nitrogen to a tenperature of 40°C. At high pressures
the hon; mixture was stabilised with ongen.

lasults and discussion
As was shown in Ref. 19. one of the criteria for evaluating the cheaical

efficiency of a laser systen is lasing duration t . Coaparing the lasing
duration for different system under identical con itions of initiation and

at identical pressures of coaponents. we can get an idea of the part played
by secondary eleaentary stages in the creation of stinulated emission.

It ehould be euphaeited that in contrast to vorke already publiehed. the
problen of the etructure of the radiation field in the case of an a! laeer
of diffueion type is much core complicated. Thie in due firet of all to
the multiple-level nature of excitation. and hence to the large nueber of
epectral linee that take part in lasing (vhich ia particularly typical of
an I! laser with a chain eechaniee of excitation). and iecOndly to the fact
that the kinetic proceeeea reeponeible for the fornation of the active
eediun in the ate; take place againet a background of diffusion ”traile"

part in for-tion of the eaieaion field etructure ie played by the gradient
of longitudinal inhoeogeneitiea of the active nediun in the direction of gas

Since the angular directionality of laeer radiation ie determined both by

A siaplified diagra- of the investigated laser is shown in Fig. 1. He vill
restrict ourselves to the case of cylindrical dirrors (the tuo-diaensional
problem). but it should be noted that such calculations. generally speaking,
will also describe the structure of the eaission field in the plene of
entry for a cavity with spherical airrors of rectangular shape (Ref. 7).

In the general case. lasing in the can. can be stiaulatsd on a lerge nuber

(v is the amber of the vibrational level. .1, is the rotational quantu-

laser requires solution of a systea of parabolic equations for the electro-

gandyneaic equations (Ref. 15. l?) at various possible values of v and J,.
In such a situation. calculation of the eaission field denanda excessive

fo detereine the structure of the fields in the cavity. the system of
written equations supple-sated by equations of gasdynanics in the quasi-
one-dieensional approxination [Ref. 15, 17] is integrated by the usual
iteration eethod with consideration of the corresponding boundary con—
ditions. For the functions yp(x; and yv(x.z) the boundary conditions are
obvious:

”Hm-0:: y.(-x.. n-o. o-o. I. . 4.’

with respect to the boundary conditions for the functions 83' v-l on the
airrors of the cavity. we note the following. Proe the integral represen-
tation of the solution for ‘3 v-l (for instance when the right-hand eeaber
of (la) is absent) we can easily see that in the case of a sufficiently
large fresnel nueber N.-eﬂl(l,,l.) the calculation of £3. v-1 requires a
rather seall integration step A): in the transverse direction (this is due
to the presence of a rapidly oscillating phase factor of the type
”(Anya/21.)). In the case of nueerical integration of system (B).

then a rectangular systas (i. e. the certesien systea x. 2).

bet us note that the idea of introducing a convergent coordinate systen is
fairly siaple (Ref. 12. 18]. In point of fact. the reverse wave is by
nature divergent. and therefore in the case of cylindrical airrors it is
convenient to treat it in the first approxiaation as a cylindrical wave‘
.anating froa a canon focus of the optical systea. Since in the geo-
aetric approximation a divergent wave occupies a region on the X2 plane
that is formed by rm enanating fra a focus and passing through the edges
of the airrors (see fig. 1). it is understandable that this region can be
transforasd by the relation

3. Initial conditions. Particulars of the masrical aethod

Initial ooditions. .As in Ref. 6, 1, the calculations were done for a
nixture of (Pg-Drusilla, and it was assuned that practically total dissocia-
tion of the surplus P2 into stone of 1" takes place with ignition of P24):
in the forechanber. Thus it was seemed that in the primary flow (i. e. in
the flow of oxidant) enanating iron the nozzle unit there is no nolecular
fluorine. It was also assumed that aixing of the reagents takes place
under standard conditions. the shape of the flame front is described

by the relation yg/h.- (at/m) -' characteristic of the nude of luinar nixing.
Denoting the solar fractions of particles 1’, F2, Be and DP in the primary
flow by E , we introduce the following parameters: «gntylﬁﬁ- 23").

terizes the degree of dissociation of F1, 83. -- the degree of heliu dilution
of the primary flow. and any -- the content of D? nolecules.

me principal version for which the calculations were done is characterized
by the following paraneters of flows: prinary flow pl- 5 III Bg, T1 I275 K,
u;-2.1 Ins/s, np-l, due-15 and app-2; secondary flow pg'S In ﬁg, Tznllo K
and u; I2.3 ha/s.

'ihe diffusion length (characteristic airing length) in the calculations was
taken as equal to m- 30 ca, the length of the active nediun (height of
the nozzle unit) In '20 cu. ‘nae telescopic cavity was assmed to be
sy-etric relative to the optical axis, the size of the larger (concave)
mirror being as; ll3 cn, and its radius of curvature 81-9 a, which were
taken as fixed in the model calculations. The latter means that when the
quantity )1 is varied (coefficient of anplification) there is a change both
in the size of the small nirror as; wag/s. and in the radius of curvature,
as well as in cavity length L. Let us also note that the distance fro- the
nozzle tip to the optical axis of the cavity (so I 2.5 en) was likewise taken
as fixed.

Rn'ticulars of the merioal mthad. In the coaputational approximation of
parabolic wave equations for Q w-l and U; w-l a two-layer implicit schene
of the second order of accuracy'(Cranh-llichélson schene) was used (Ref. 18],
and the resultant system of algebraic equations for net-point functions was
solved by the neth of scalar sweep-out with conplex coefficients (analog
of matrix sweep-out). It should be pointed out that using a sweep aethod
requires foraulstion of the corresponding boundary conditions on the side
boundaries of the integration regions, 1. e. at nuts. and 5- at... As in
Ref. 13. we used zero boundary conditions timer” :)-0 and 7;” (thug-o
to sinplify the algorithn. and to prevent the fictitious boundaries froa
influencing the structure of the fields in the cavity, they had to be
shifted quite a distance (for instance we took x.eas1).

As a rule, the calculations used from NO to 600 points in the transverse
direction (along the x axis), and 30-60 points in the longitudinal direction.
This number of pointu is completely sufficient for guaranteeing adequate

accuracy of integration both for the equations of the active aediu and
for the equations of the enission field. Let us note that the typical tine
for calculating a single variant (8-10 double passes of the cavity) on the
DEM-6 coaputer was 1 hour. which is approxieately double the tips for

calculating an analogous problea in the geoeetrical optics approxieation
lief.

‘lb speed up convergence of the iteration process we used (as is usually done
(Ref.12-lh]) saoothing of the edges of the airror-a. ‘lb do this.we intro-

duced the gamsian for-n of uependence of coefficients of reflection on

In order for the edges of the airrors to rennin sufficiently sharp. the
coefficients of snoothing 11 were taken as equal to 11-12 '10, . If we
consider the fact that the order of the least umber still distinct fra 0
in the DEM-6 coeputer is 10‘" . it can be estiasted that the width of the
saoothing sections in our case did not exceed “30.2 cu.

Finally. let us late one last remark. The calculation of energy character-
istics of the (”CL (reduced power of stiaulated eeission. cheaical efficiency
and so on) is done according to relaticns found for 1" x) in a standard
way (Ref. 6.15. 1?]. Knowing in addition the phase di‘trigu’t‘ion in the
plane of the output nirror. and using the Kirchhoff-Fresnel integral. one

can readily find the distributioa of the eeission field in the far zone as
well. i. e. the radiation pattern. 0fcourae. we will not go into these
probleee further here.

t. Discussion of the results

In Ref. 6. where the energy characteristics of the OWL were calculated in
the geceetric optics approximation, it was shown that under coniitions of
rotational equilibriu of working aolecules stable steady-state eeission

for each of the vibrational lasing hands is realised only on the one
rotational P-transition. In our research within the fraaework of the
diffraction approach additional study involving this problee has been done.
Investigation of the possibility of sinultaneous stiluleted emission on two
adJacent transitions (with J. and 3,, :1) of a single band has shown that
regardless of the choice of initial conditions the lutual coepetition of two
radiative transitions leads to suppression of one of then (see Fig. 2) For
instance under the investi ated conditions stable steady-state lasing was
achieved only on lines P2( ) and 15(6). and therefore in further calculations
it was assumed that 31-12-6

phase diagran. Clearly phase distortions have a nuch greater influence on
the radiation pattern than uplitude distortions (see for instance lief. 20).

It is clear free the given curves that in the investigated case when Hz 3
the active nediu of the (MCI. introduces weak distortions into the field
structure of an cnpty cavity, and as s consequence the radiation pattern

of 0061. enission practically coincides with that of an eapty cavity with
the sole exception of a slight overall background. last us note that the
shift of curves 1; 0(0) and I; .(0) relative to one another on Fig. I; can
be attributed rmt of m to the difference in the wave nunhers M of the
corresponding lines. With a further reduction in the gain of the cavity.
asy-etry shows up both in the structure of the fields and phases relative
to the optical axis of the cavity. and in the radiation pattern itself.

The nest appreciable asy—etry is observed at H fairly close to unity, i. e.
in the region of strong radiation fields that lead to rapid depletion of the
active nediun in the direction of gas notion. Calculations show that the
asy-etry also increases with a reduction in the degree of heliun dilution
of the aixture (with a reduction in B“ ) and with an increase in the height
of the nozsle unit (with increasing in, which can be attributed nainly to
the seas caues.

nonetheless. despite these distortions and the appearance of a background.
the characteristic angular width of the radiation pattern for each fixed M
changes couparatively weekly. and as a rule increases by no lore than a
factor of 1.5-2 as capared with an enpty cavity. This circu-stance enables
us to control the eaission divergence of the om by changing the gain M.
It is also clear that the reduction in divergence with increasing ii is due
to an increase in the size of the luineecent region in the plane of the
output airror. but it should be noted that at the sale tine there is a
drop in laser efficiency (Pig. 5). ‘lhe latter
is due of course to the fact that gains on indi-
vidual vibrational-rotational transitions in the
m are conparetively low (04".1ZO.OS-o.l cn"
and “.v-l‘u‘zL

It is of interest to estiaate the limiting angular

Consider now the case of a stable confocal cavity. It is known that in this
case thehhalf-width of the radiation pattern is evaluated by the relation
“EU/L) . where L is the length of the cavity. "hen [ml-3 n. this gives

radiation. the latter figure lust be increased by a considerable factor.

It in clear fron these estiaates that the use of telescopic cavities in the
act in principle enables an ieproveasnt in the directionality of emission
by approxieately an order of Iagnitude. Of course the actual radiation
pattern will also depend on a nulber of additional factors not considered
here: lisalignnent of mirrors, deviation of airror surface fro. the ideal
for. (in particular due to nonuniform heating under the action of poweer
laser radiation) and so forth. Accounting for these factors goes beyond
the scope of this work.

let \- note a few acre results of our research. In the first place. the
calculations show that for a fixed H. a change in cavity length L. i. e.

in the radius of curvature of the large airror R; (R; being varied free 3
to 15 n) has extrseisly little effect on either the efficiency or the
divergence of the radiation. Let us nention that with a reduction in Mm).
i. s. with an increase in the Fresnel umber. efficiency drops soaewhat. end
there is an increase in the directionality of eaission. Secondly. due to
lack of space we will not give here the results of «spoken of the dif-
fraction and geouetric-optics netth of calculating a CHCL with telescope
cavity. levertheless. it should be noted that such a caparison shows
couplete applicability of the geoaetric optics approxination for calculating
the energy characteristics of the “CL. For this reason we will also onit
here any discussion of the influence that individual pare-eters of the
systel (including cavity geomtry) have on the energy properties of the
over. (see for instance Ref. 6).

5. Conclusion

‘lhus our research shows that with a aoderste reduction of efficiency the
use of unstable ccvities in a own should lead to a considerable increase
in the directionality of radiation. Even taking the losses in efficiency
into consideration. it should nevertheless be acknowledged that this is
quite sound in a nuber of applications. It should also be pointed out that
losses in efficiency should decrease with an increase in the length of the
sctive Iediun and in power.

Let us note further that nothim has been said in this paper about the
inhoaogeneities caused by week shock waves and rarefactiOn waves that are

for-ed when supersonic gas Jets are discharged into the cavity space [Ref.
21]. ‘lhere has been practically no mention either of the effects caused by

flow turbulisstion. It can be noted with respect to the foner effects that
adequate consideration on the given stage is a fairly conplicated problel.
and to all appearances requires the use of liavier-Stohes equations. 0n the
other hand. it is also clear that it is desirable in practice to realize
nodes of flow that are close to rated conditions. and in this case the
influence of the given effects is aininised.

As to turbulent effects. in the case of a CVCL on a "cold" reaction short
laser zones are usually realised. and as experiments have shown. turbulence
