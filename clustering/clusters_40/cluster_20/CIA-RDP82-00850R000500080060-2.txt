[Abstract] An effort was made to determine how sensitive the macroscale charac-
teristics of the climatic regime computed in models are to the methods employed
in parameterizing the boundary layer and which of the adopted hypotheses or val-
ues of the initial parameters are most important for a proper description of
turbulent flows. By means of numerical experiments with a three-dimensional hy-
drodynamic model of the atmosphere a study was made of response of the computed
climatic regime to methods for boundary layer parameterisetion in the example
of two schemes: a semiempiricsl scheme (scheme I) and a scheme based on the hy-
potheses of similarity theory (scheme II). The schemes. first proposed by other
authors, are examined in detail. The basic differences between the schemes are
as follows: in scheme 1 no allowance is made for the vertical change in the di-
rection of the wind velocity vector in the boundary layer and accordingly the
change in the vector of turbulent frictional stress is not taken into account;
in the first scheme no allowance is made for the differences in aerodynamic
characteristics of the underlying surface on the continents and oceans; the
ache-es use different values of equilibriu gradients. It was found that the
total quantity of heat entering the atmosphere from the underlying surface over
the cont inenta and oceans is approximately identical in both experiments, but
the formation of circulation, the thermal regime and moisture cycle in the at-
mosphere is considerably influenced by the redistribution of this heat between
explicit and latent forms. The most important conclusion drawn is that the use
of similarity theory hypotheses in s model is preferable because the mean zonal
distribution of temperature and the intensity of macroscale quasistationary
pressure systems over the oceans and continents agree better with actual data.

[Article by R. K. nige. doctor of geographical sciences, Institute of Hater

[Text] Abstract: An investigation of long-tern
changes in individual coqonents of the
global water balance indicated that they
are prinarily deter-lined by the change
in observed global thernal conditions at
the land surface. As a result of aodern
changes in clients and water «change
processes a gradual dessicstion of the
continents and replenisI-nt of the world
ocean is occurring.

Investigations carried out during recent years indicate that as a result of a
change in a nunber of geophysical processes and especme natural energy
factors, which deterained climatic fluctuations. global water exchange is
experiencing considerable fluctuations. Since the end of the last century
there has been an appreciable warning of clinate, which attained a uni-:- in
the ”Jo's-1960's, constituting almost l'c. Then there was none dropoff of
tenperature to the laid-1960's. which was then replaced by its relatively snsll
increase (6, 21, 27]. According to data published by H. I. Budyho [2], the
tenperature increase during the last 12 years’ was about 0.3'C.

An important feature is the considerably greater (approxinately by a factor
of 3.5) anplitude of tenperature changes in the high latitudes than in the
low latitudes. which is leading to a substantial change in the nsan naridional
tenperature gradient. Computations show that an increase in air tenperature in
the northern henisphere by 0.1'c will lead to a relative decrease in the ner-
idional gradient by 0.51 for nean annual conditions [3). There is a quite
close inverse relationship between then which is changing sonewhat in depend-
ence on the namitude of the teqerature anonalies:

The changes in the meridional gradient in turn determine the changes in the
nature of the intensity of atmospheric circulation and the corresponding
changes in the regime of moisture receipt on the continents. For example,
according to the data published by O. A. Drozdov [7], during the period of
the warming there is a decrease in the intensity of moisture transfer and
an increase in precipitation over the oceans and its decrease in the intra-
continental regions. During the period 1891-1973, with a global warming by
0.S°C, there was an appreciable decrease in winter precipitation over a large
part of the grain regions. During this season the decrease in the sums of
precipitation in a number of cases attained 302 of the average. Although the
change in mean annual precipitation was less, nevertheless in a number of
regions it attained 10-152 [3].

Investigations of the correlation between the total quantity of precipita-
tion over the area of the continents. computed both on the basis of data
from direct observations [31] and on the basis of water balance computa-
tions. indicated that with a global increase in air temperature as a rule
its quantity over the land increases. which can be written approximately as
follows:

xcon - 798.7 + 156.8 At“ mm.

At the same time. an analysis of the correlation between the total quantity
of precipitation and the change in the meridional gradient revealed a ten—
dency to an inverse dependence. which is particularly characteristic for the
intracontinentsl regions and can be expressed approximately as follows:

xcon - 801.2 - 285mm“ mm.

The correlations between precipitation and anomalies of mean annual air tem-
perature (Atm) and the meridional temperature gradients ( AYNH) of the
northern hemisphere make it possible to obtain an approximate equation for
determining global precipitation over the territory of the land (without
Antarctica and the islands):
xc'on - 73.39 (10.89 +Atm - 1.944Ym) Ill.
In general, for the territory of the land the long-term changes in precipita-
tion anomalies (xcon) can also be computed with a definite degree of approx-
imation using the water balance equation [11]. taking into account changes in

evaporation (zcon) and river runoff (AYcon)

Axcon ' “con I” Azcon) + (Ycon *AYcon) ‘ xcon'

water balance computations show that long-term changes in precipitation in
the current century had a number of peculiarities.

For example. an increase in precipitation (somewhat mre than 21) occurred
over the ocean (Fig. l) in the late l930’s-early 1940's (during a period of
warming). whereas over the territory of the continents (without Antarctica
and the islands) during this period there was a sharp reduction of precipit-
ation and the meridional gradient (about 1'0).

The temporal Variability of precipitation in Antarctica was investigated

on the basis of the annual layer of snow accumulation. averaged by decades.
by H. Schwerdtfeger [29], N. V. Petrov [l6], and others. It was found that
the rate of feeding of the Antarctic ice cover increased from the end of the
19th century to the 1930's and began to decrease by the l9b0's-l950's.

The long—term variation of the change in the percentage of precipitation
over the continental territory relative to ocean areas is of definite inter-
est; it shows (Fig. 1) that with the development of a warming the percent~
age of precipitation over the continents begins to decrease and attains a
minimum (in the limits 2!) during the period of the highest temperatures

and their minimum gradients.

In general. however, for the current century against the background of a
general gradual warming a small tendency to an increase in precipitation
over the continents (without Antarctica) was characteristic; this amounted
to about 0.25 mm (31 km3) per year or about 0.031. The peculiarities of

the long-term variation of precipitation are very closely related to the
long-term changes in mean annual air temperature and changes in its mer-
idional gradient. With an increase in air temperature there was an increase
in evaporation from the surface of the world ocean. The transport of this
moisture onto the continent led to an increase in precipitation at the be-
ginning of the warming. At the same time, with an increase in temperature
there was an appreciable change in the anomalies of the meridional air tem-
perature gradient which attained minimum values during the period of maxi-
mum warming in the 1940's. with a change in the latitudinal temperature
gradient there was a change in the intensity of water vapor transport from
the ocean onto the continents [2]. A decrease in the meridional temperature
gradient led to a lessening of the intensity of atmospheric circulation.
which finally led to a decrease in the flow of water vapor arriving in the
intracontinenral regions and the quantity of precipitation over a consid-
erable part of the land decreased. The opposite situation developed in the

l950's-1960's.

Quite significant changes should occur in the current century in evaporation
processes, which are determined by the relationship of heat and moisture in

different regions.

The total annual evaporation as a whole from the territory of the land, with-
out islands and Antarctica, can be determined approximately uging an equation
taking into account the mean annual temperature of the land (tcon), air tem-

perature anomalies in the northern hemisphere (A t“), mean _a_nnual river

(Ycon) and underground runoff (Uc ) and their anomalies (‘sycon’ lecon).

An investigation of evaporability (Z.v.p ) on the continents during the period
1881-1975 shows that it. changing proportionally to variations in mean annual
air tesperature. could vary iron 1083 mm (1884-1885) to 1161 Im/year (1938)
(32.51) with a mean long-term value of about 1110 am (Zubenok, 1976). Between
1881 and 1938 there was a tendency to an increase in the maximum possible
evaporation on the average with a rate of about 0.7 mm/yesr, which then was
replaced by a tendency to its decrease in the limits 0.55 Ila/year (Pig. 2).

Computations of the long-tern variation of total evaporation from the entire
area of the continents without Antarctica (area about 125.1 aillion kmz ) aade
it possible to establish its variations (+6. 51) in anomalies from -39 2(1805)
to 22 nn/year (1938) with a mean long-ter; value of 526 II (65 802 km2 ). In
the long-tern variation of total evaporation fro. the land it is possible to
note a number of characteristic periods (Pig. 2). For example, increased
evaporation was observed primarily during the years 1897-1901, 1921-1954.
1970-1975. and reduced evaporation during the periods 1881-1896, 1902-1920,
1955-1969 with a mean period of about 16 years. Evaporation was also charac-
terized by a tendency to an increase of about 0.3 mn/year (0.072). These
changes in total evaporation from the territory of the land were detersined
by the nature of the relationship between the heat and water resources of
the land during individual periods.

One of the important components of global water exchange is river runoff,
study of whose variations shows that in general the change in runoff and
total precipitation falling on the continents is quite closely related to
air temperature fluctuations. Usually for large regions with an increase in
temperature to a definite limit both precipitation and runoff increase. how-
ever, for individual physiogrsphic regions the pattern can differ somewhat.
especially in internal regions located in a zone of inadequate aoistening
[10. 15].

A decrease in the runoff of the continents in individual cases can also oc-

cur during periods of cooling when there is a decrease in evaporation from
the ocean surface. a decrease in the receipts of moisture on the land. as

In general. for the territory of the land. including regions without runoff

(without the islands of Antarctica). the change in river and underground run-
off was from 2763 (1925) to 317 Ildysar (1897,1976). which with an amplitude
of 60 an (5004 n 3) attained fluctuations in the range 16. 51 of its mean long-

over continents (xcon) and percentage of continental precipitation relative

to oceanic precipitation (Xcon Z).

In the course of the last hundred years the total runoff of the continents as
a whole did not experience an adequately definite tendency in its changes,
despite an appreciable increase in global te-peratures and an increase in
evaporation of about 8. 8 kn3/year. The conpensation of losses in runoff by
evaporation occurred due to an increase in the runoff of nountain rivers as
a result of the sore intensive thawing of glaciers, which gave an increase

in runoff volule of about 0. 6 kn 3/year, and also an increase in the runoff
of ocean-facing slopes as a result of an increase in precipitation.

In the runoff of internal regions without runoff there is a negative tendency
which leads to its decrease by about 8. 8 kn 3lyear (Pig. 2).

A slight tendency to an increase in runoff is observed in rivers flowing direct-
ly into the ocean and a more appreciable positive tendency is characteristic

for runoff from islands (Fig. 2) in a volule of about 1.2 kn lyear, caused

by the tendency to an increase in precipitation in the ocean region.

The reduction in the runoff of internal regions of the land, an increase in
evaporation and some reduction of precipitation led to a decrease in the
total moistening of the continents, especially of regions without runoff.
This circuustance was clearly reflected in a decrease in the level and vol-
uses of lakes without runoff [9. 20].

Computations of the change in the increase in the total voluse of lakes with-
out runoff in dependence on fluctuations of their level and area show that
the strongest reduction in volumes occurred in the 1960's in the period of

FOI403FHJAI.USIINVLY

greatest warming. At this time the total discharge of lake waters could at-
tain 380 km3/year (Fig. 3). Between 1890 and 1940 the water reserves in the
lakes were reduced by almost 6000 km3, which was about 3.42 of their total

mm (176 400 1.1.3).

From the mid-1960‘s up to 1975 the total volume of the lakes had increased
in the limits of about 2000 km3, which was associated with a cooling during
this period.

In general, during the period 1896-1975 the mean reduction of lake waters was
about 33 ka3/year (Fig. 3. Table l).

The present century is characterised by a decrease in the reserves of ground
water on the continents [12]. Investigations show that this process trans—
pired most intensively free the 1920's through the 1950's, when the volume
of ground water decreased at a mean rate of about 860 km3/year (Fig. 3).

The changes in ground water reserves were determined primarily by thermal
variations at the earth‘s surface. At the same time. the percentage of the
anthropogenic effect with each passing year is becoming increasingly signif-
icant. especially for such regions as Europe and North America.

A najor role in the change in global water exchange can be played by the
earth's glacier cover by an increase or decrease in the quantity of water par-
ticipating in the active cycle at the earth's surface.

The total glacier flow is about 6300 km3/year. The overwhelming majority of
this quantity is accounted for by runoff from the largest ice sheets. Each

year about 2200 km3 of water enters the ocean from Antarctica, and from Green-
land -- about 800 km3. Together this amounts to 92 of the runoff of all the
rivers of the earth. In Greenland the liquid runoff constitutes almost half of
its discharge, whereas in Antarctica almost the entire discharge occurs by the
calving of icebergs (the total liquid runoff is 15 km3). In the modern era ice-
bergs in the southern hemisphere are propagated to 65-50’8 and their total vol-
uae, entering into the world ocean, is equal to approximately half the an-

nual runoff of the earth's rivers.

Investigations of many [6, 19, 22, 24, 26, 28. 30] glaciologists indicate that
from the end of the 19th century an appreciable decrease of the earth's gla-
cier cover began. Between 1900 and 1950 it decreased by approximately 101.

The average thickness of the ice in the Arctic decreased by half and its area
decreased by more than lOX. The most intensive decrease in glaciation occurred
in the l930's-1960's. In the l960's-l970's the reduction in glaciation was
slowed and in many regions there was a change to an advance. This was asso-
ciated primarily with a relatively small global decrease in temperature and

an increase in precipitation in a number of regions.

These computations indicated that during the period from 1908 to 1958 there
was a reduction in the water reserves in mountain glaciers at a rate of about
58 km3/year. for glaciers of the arctic islands -- 37 km3/year. for the glac-
iers of Greenland - 27S ka3/year, for the glaciers of Antarctica -- 770 km3/
year. This process has now slowed considerably, although the reduction of

glaciers still attains about 170 km3/year (Pig. 3).

An ever- increasing influence on the change in the regime of waters on the
land is being exerted by the activity of Ian. as a result of which, on the
one hand. there is an appreciable increase in the losses of water in evapor-
ation in the process of developmt of irrigation and an increase in the
area of reservoirs. and on the other hand, an a result of the construction of

water uanagesent structures there is an accumulation of water in artificial
water bodies and a replenishment of waters on the land. In general, at the

The change in the water balance of the land is very closely related to changes
in the entire world water balance. including the water balance of the uorld
ocean.

The principal discharge or loss cosponent of the water balance of the ocean
is evaporation fron its surface, vhich in combination with the peculiarities
of atnoapheric circulation determines the receipts of moisture on the land.

Since the nagnitude of the long-term change in evaporation from the ocean sur—
face is closely related to the heat receipts. to a conaiderable degree it
oust be proportional to the change in thermal conditions at the earth's sur-
face. The earning in the current century should lead to an increase in total

evaporation from the ocean and a definite increase in the intensity of the
moisture cycle. Computations [10. 17 and others] show that beginning from
the end of the last century. when the evaporability anomalies could attain
about -60 mm. up to the 1960's there should be a predominance of a tendency
to an increase in total evaporation from the ocean (Fig. 6). which should
lead to its increase by 78 mm (by almost 27 000 km3). or by more than S! of
its mean long-term value of 507 153 km3 (1895—1915). By the 1960's there was
some decrease (about 22).

Relatively intensive recent changes in global water exchange are causing ap-
preciable variations in the volume of the world ocean. which during the per-
iod from 1894 through 1975 could attain from -10 196 km3 (1916) to +9366
km3/yesr (1916. 1961) (Fig. 3), on the average being about +316 km3 (Table
3). The nest substantial increment in the water mass of the ocean occurred
during the period 1908-1958. when on the average it could attain about 1103
km3/year. and if it were not for the creation of artificial water bodies,
holding part of the surface waters. this quantity would have attained 1118
km3. During the period from 1894 through 1975 the ocean was supplemented

by so 253 n.3, which 1. only about 6.3-10'32 of 1:. mass.

The annual quantity of precipitation on the ocean surface can be determined
approximately on the basis of the change in the main components of water ex-
change in the world ocean: ocean volume £385cc‘n, level [380. area Focean'

ment of the volume of ocean waters roean and anomalies of mean sea surface

In the long-term variation of precipitation up to 1940 there was a predom-
inance of a tendency to its increase with a mean rate of about 500 km3/year.
which then was replaced by a tendency to a decrease in precipitation of ap-
proximately the same magnitude. The lowest precipitation quantities over the
ocean probably fell in 1882, 1908. 1912 and 1916 when they must have been ap-
proximately 30-60 mm below the mean long-term value. whereas the highest quan-
tities. with an excess of the mean long~term value by an amount somewhat
greater than 60 smgcorresponded to the maximum warming in the years 1938 and
1901. The total changes in precipitation during the period from 1818 through
1966 were a relatively low value of about :31 (Pig. 6).

Thus. actual data show that with an increase in global temperature there is
an increase in the total quantity of precipitation not only over the waters

of the world ocean. but also in general over the territory of both the entire
earth and the continents. It must be remembered that the distribution of

12

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

precipitation over the territory of the land will change considerably: the
coastal regions and the oceanic slopes should experience a considerable
increase in precipitation. whereas in the intracontinental regions during
periods of considerable warnings (1°C) the precipitation should be reduced.

One of the most important problems is a clarification of the possible changes
in global water exchange in the future. The investigations which have been
made show that these changes will be very closely related to variations in
climatic conditions at the earth's surface and the development of the influ-
ence exerted by man's activity on natural processes.

An analysis of the variability of the elements of global heat exchange by
means of autocorrelation functions indicated that there is a definite lag

in these elements relative to climatic fluctuations. For example, the level
of the world ocean has a lag relative to quite large variations in global
temperature by 11 years. the ground water level -- by 12 years. the level of
the Caspian Sea - by 15 years. the level of lakes without runoff - on the
average by 6 years. etc. This circumstance makes it possible with a definite
degree of reliability to foresee possible changes in individual elements

of water exchange in the immediate future.

An investigation of the components of global water exchange shows that at
the present time the tendencies in their changes are determined primarily
by a relatively increased (by 0.5’C) air temperature at the earth's surface.

The computations show that even if the climatic conditions existing at the
present time remain unchanged, at least over the course of a decade one
should expect retention of existing tendencies in change in water balance
components. This is associated primarily with the warming in the 20th cen-
tury. as a result of which the equilibrium of water exchange changed. Thus.
the level of the world ocean will also in the future continue to rise at a
rate of about 1-2 I- per year, which will lead to a further replenishment of
its water mass and a corresponding reduction of the water reserves on the
territory of the land.

To be sure. it must be taken into account that if there are significant changes
in climatic conditions. accordingly in the future fluctuations of water bal-
ance elements may occur more sharply.

There is much evidence in archeology. in the accumulation of sedimentary strata
in water bodies, in peat bogs. in dendrology and in glaciology that climatic
conditions in many cases were characterised by far sharper variations than

have been recordered during the period of instrumental observations.

The investigations made under the direction of H. I. Budyko [5], V. Broecker
[23]. J. Hercer [25] and some other scientists show that as a result of the
anthropogenic effect. in the future. about the year 2000, one should expect
a global warming of approximately l’C. and in the more remote future. an

even greater warming. This can lead to very significant changes in the global
water exchange system.

made it possible to model processes of global water exchange and carry out
conputations using an electronic computer. This made it possible to determine
the limits of changes in the elements of global water exchange with corres-
ponding fluctuations of thermal conditions at the earth's surface. It has
therefore been established that in the case of a global cooling by l‘C in
comparison with present-day conditions evaporation from the ocean will be
reduced by ‘2 and precipitation at its surface will be reduced by 32; the
ocean level will be reduced by approximately 7 cm. 0n the land in this case
there should also be a reduction of precipitation by 162, a decrease in evap-
oration by 122 and a dropoff of river runoff by 182 with a simultaneous in-
crease in the reserves of surface waters by approximately 167 kn3/year.

Hith an increase in temperature at the earth's surface, which in the opinion
of many scientists is now more realistic, there will be an increase in the
intensity of global heat exchange and an increase in all water balance con-
ponents. For example. a temperature increase by 2.5‘C should cause an in-
crease in evaporation of the ocean by 151. an increase in precipitation over

16
FOI‘OFFKJAI.USE(HVLY

it by 121. whereas over the land precipitation. evaporation and runoff will
increase on the average by 66~471 with a simultaneous decrease in water re-
serves by approximately £60 ka3lyear. which in turn would lead to an increase
in the level of the world ocean as a ainiaul by 180 In.

It should be noted that the results of evaluation of possible changes in
water exchange, to be sure, reflect extre-ely general characteristics which
can be a background for nore real changes in specific regions. For example.
although precipitation over the land during a warning will in general in-
crease, in the intracontinental regions it can be reduced as a result of a
reduction in the intensity of circulation during warning due to the evening-
out of temperatures. The results also do not take into account during a warm-
ing of the gradual reduction in the area of the snow and ice cover. which
can exert a considerable influence both on evaporation processes and on heat
exchange. In addition. no allowance was made for the increase in cloud cover
and the quantity of water vapor in the atmosphere and this can reduce the
effect of an increase in temperature and evaporation and some other factors
whose influence for the time being cannot be evaluated with sufficient ac-

curacy.

Uarming can also lead to other significant changes in water exchange. For ex-
ample. there can be a decay of the glacier cover in the western part of the
Antarctic and this would cause a considerable replenishment of the world
ocean with an intensive rise in its level with a rate up to tens of centi-

meters per year.

[Abstract] One of the siaple nethods for studying complex atmospheric pro-
cesses is their representation in the form of the sum of elementary waves.
HDVevel’, in the low latitudes the construction of wave solutions is cosplicat-
ed by two factors: for the narrow equatorial zone with a width of shout 500
In on each side of the equator the system of equations in hydrodynamics is es-
sentially nonlinear and the Coriolis force at the equator becomes equal to
zero. Quasigeostrophicity therefore cannot be used for mscroscale movements.
Accordingly, the simplification of the equations of atmospheric dynamics and
the methods for their analysis by means of breakdown into elementary waves,
co-only used for the middle latitudes. when applied to the low latitudes

lead to extremely different results, depending on what siwlifications are
used in a specific model. In the low latitudes the principal types of waves are
Rosshy and Kelvin waves. In mat studies of low-latitude wave movaents the
authors have neglected the second component of Coriolis acceleration (sin if )3
it is small. but at the equator it is the only term which is significant. The
author here reviews this problem. examining questions related to the finding
of wave solutions and their interpretation froe a system of equations in hy-
drodynamics correct for latitudes 5-15' within the framework of a purely zonal
model. The Dobryshasn system of equations is used as a point of departure. The
presence of variable coefficients (sin 9’ . cos 4! ) greatly conplicates anal-
ysis of this system. which is utremsly sensitive to what transformations are
made with these variable coefficients. Three variants of wave solutions are
outlined. The examined variants show that the results are essentially dependent
on the procedure for siaplifying the initial system of equations. Examples are
presented which show how the dispersion expression and the solution of the
equations are modified with the neglecting of smell terms. It is shown that
allowance for vertical velocity limits the number of wave solutions for long
waves to n - 5. Figures 2; references 5: 3 Russian. 2 Western.

[Abstract] A study was nade of the possibility of using a lidsr for determin-
ing the predictors of formation and dispersal of radiation fogs and ascer—
taining their difference from other neteorological phenomena. The method ela-
ployed is based on measurements of the scattering coefficients at two wave-
lengths. such as 0.53pm and 1.06pm. For small particles (?< 1.1.1:) the val-
ue of the scattering coefficient 0' at the wavelength 31 is several times
greater than for ). . During water vapor condensation the size of the par-
ticles increases a therefore the difference in 5' will decrease. evidence of

tiple scattering. which depolarises the signal to a considerable degree. The
method for investigating the dynsnics of formation and scattering of a for

is thus based on measurement of the degree of polarization P and the ratio

of the scattering coefficients 012/011. this giving information mostly on
the beginning of formation of a fog and the stage in its development. The ex-
perinental studies were made in the regions of Dolgoprudnyy. Ryl'sk and Kish—
inev during 1976-1978. The measurements at the mentioned wavelengths were
made using a two—frequency lidsr at the mentioned wavelengths. A total of 235
series of measurements were made at different seasons of the year and differ-
ent times of day. These measurements were accompanied by observations of tee-
pernture. haidity and meteorological range of visibility. It was found that
the lidsr nathod is quite effective in the absence of precipitation. Specific
examples are discussed. The lidsr is demonstrated to be an effective tool for
the meteorological service for making short-range forecasts of the appearance
and dispersal of radiation fogs. figures 2, tables 2: references: 6 Russian.

[Abstract] Over a period of years the senior author carried out a layer-by-
layer sampling of firs and ice samples in Antarctica in the neighborhood of
Hirnyy. Holoderhnaya. Bellinsgausen and Vostok stations. Dating of layers was
by the stratigraphic method and on the basis of the content of dust particles.
On this basis it was possible to analyse the conposition of the snow cover in
different parts of the continent. Table 1 gives thI ioncentrations of radio-
nuclides (3:7. In“, 2:95 + Nb”, M106, c.137. 0e ‘ . eel“) in the upper ice
laye' for i969. 1970 and 1971. The observed isotopic composition is attribut-
utle to a mixture of fission fragments and activation products from nuclear
shots set off in both the northern a‘d southern hemispheres. The teaporal
changes in radioactive fallout and t e concentration of long-lived nuclides in
Antarctica has a pattern similar to that for the northern hemisphere. The low-
er levels of radioactive contamination and their temporal lag after 1963 are
attributable to the fact that the pr‘ncipsl source of radioactive products of
nuclear shots during this period was the northern hemisphere stratosphere. Dur-
ing stratospheric transport most of the radioactive products were lost from the
atmosphere in the northern heaisphere so that only a small part reached the
southern henisphere after 2 year. Hater vapor is transported across the equa-
tor and reaches the Antarctic continent more rapidly than the aerosol products
of nuclear explosions, the reason for this being unclear for the tine being.

A aethod is outlined for coaputing atmospheric fallout and atnospheric con-
ccntration of these products in preceding years when direct measurements were
not made. Also discussed is the transformation of the properties of an aerosol
during its transport from the northern heaisphere to the shores of Antarctica.
The time required for the noveasnt of air masses iron the northern hemisphere
into the southern hemisphere in the troposphere and stratosphere was ascer-
tained, as was the time of half-elimination from the stratosphere in the south
polar region. Pigures 3, tables #3 references 17: 10 Russian. 7 western.

[Article by B. K. Blinov, Institute of Experimental Meteorology]

[Abstract] A field experiment was carried out for ascertaining the character-
istics of migration of mercury from the soil surface layer. The work was done
in two water-balance areas each measuring 100 m2. In the spring of 1976 mer-
cury sulfate was applied on the snow cover of one of these areas, whereas

the other area served as a control. The analysis of samples was made by the
atomic-absorption method using a HAS-50 spectrophotometer and the mean stan-
dard error in the determination did not exceed 10!. Mercury profiles in the
soil of the experimental sector were determined 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 years
after onset of the experiment. It was determined that the principal role in
the transport of Hg from the surface layer is played by evaporation. During
the warm season of the year about 602 of the mercury present in the surface
layer passes into the air. The rate of evaporation for-Moscow Oblast is char-
acterized by an evaporation coefficient equal to l.52¢0.42 year'l. The next
most important process is transport of Hg into the depth of the soil; as a
result of Hg transport into the underlying layers from the horizon 0-10 cm
about 161 of the annual surface receipts of ﬁg disappears into the depth of
the soil. Runoff carries away abzut $2 of the surface receipts; the runoff
coefficient is l.5°10"10.32'10‘ am'l. No more than 0.52 passes into plants
and is removed with the harvest; this is described by the biological absorp-
tion coefficient, which for grain crops is equal to 0.510.2. The data pre-
sented here can be used in predicting the contamination of soddy-podzolic
soils for a period up to several years. Figures 1. tables 3; references 25:

[Text] Abstract: The authors describe methods for
a diagnostic computation of currents and
three-dimensional smoothing of density
fields by means of which it was possible
to determine the circulation of waters.
The initial data are the density field of
sea water, bottom relief and dispersion
of these values. averaged over the area
of 1' squares. The results of the comput-
ations are presented in the form of vec-
tor ...ps of our-er and winter circulation
of surface waters of the ocean giving eval-
uations of the accuracy in determining
these vectors. A comparative analysis of
the constructed pattern of currents and
the results of investigations made earlier
is presented.

Computations of the circulation of waters were made by the method in [7. 8].
which sakes it possible to determine the three components of the geostrophic
velocity vector on the basis of the stipulated density field of sea water and
bottom relief. taking into account information on the error in stipulating
these initial data. The results of the computations are represented in the
form of evaluations of the mathematical expectations and dispersions of cur-
rent velocities. stable relative to the errors in stipulating the initial
data.

A stability of the results is achieved because the current velocities at each
investigated horizon are determined from solution of an overdetermined system
of equations whose realization is accomplished taking into account the disper-
sions of the density field, bottom relief and the current velocity values at
the reference horizon. The indicated system consists of the continuity

squares method (01.51!) [2]. which in comparison with the least squares method
(L5H) [1] has the advantage that its realization is unrelated to the assmption
of a normal law of distribution of errors in stipulation of the right-hand
sides of the considered system of equations. The solution has the form

where V'- (u, v] is the vector of evaluations of the sought-for values of the
horizontal currents; R(V) is the covariation matrix of the V vector. A is the
matrix of system of equations (l)-(3); ‘1’ is the vector of the right-hand sides
of equations (l)-(3); H is a weighting matrix, determined in the form It - "‘1.
where N is the covariation matrix of the 7 vector. The methods for stipulat-
ing the covariation matrix N. which is a function of the second statistical
moments of the density field. bottom relief and current velocities at the ref-
erence horizon.were described in detail in [8].

at which observations were made fron 1960 through 1977. The density fields
were stipulated st 24 standard horizons in the interval fron 0 to 4000 a.

At each horizon the sea water density values. averaged over the area of 1’
squares, were snoothed. The snoothing was carried out in one of four variants:

where the euhscripts i and 1 indicate the sequence nunher of the point in the
zonal and neridional directions and cl": are weighting factors dependent on
the depth of the horizon and on the thic see of the layer of the Iain ther-
nocline.

The choice of the snoothing variant was deternined in dependence on the posi-
tion of the point for deternining density (1. 1) relative to the contour of
the lateral boundaries at this horizon.

In those cases when not one of the enunerated snoothing variants could he
realized the density value at the point (i. j) regained unchanged.

The letter circumstance was taken into account when deternining the horizontal
derivatives of the density field, which were deternined in the following way:

a) determined from the area of a 1' square if not one of the four points situ-
ated at its corners touched the hotton;

h) were asauned equal to zero if at least one of the points touched the botton
or was situated within its linits.

we note that the snoothing fornulas (l)-(b) with the values

c-l. c2-1,c3-l.cb-l. c5-1.c6-l,c1-l
correspond to the formulas which are cited in [6].
when carrying out snoothing of the density fields in the investigated region

of the Indian Ocean we tool: the following peculiarities of the used observa-
tional data into account:

1) Host of the data were in the linits of the haroclinic layer.

2) Within the linits of the lower boundary of the haroclinic layer the accuracy
in neasuring anonalies of the hydrological fields is conensurahle with the an-
plitude of these anonalies.

3) wi'h an increase in latitude there is an increase in the thickness of the
barocl inic layer.

Taking into account the factors enumerated above, we introduce the dependence
of the weighting factors in formulas (6)-(9) on the depth of the lower boun-
dary of the baroclinic layer and on the depth of the horizon at which smooth-
ing is carried out. In determining these coefficients at the ocean surface
smoothing was accomplished using the formulas proposed in [4) since they are
most effective under conditions when the anplitude of changes in the density
field exceeds the observation errors. Beyond the limits of the baroclinic
layer the amplitude of the changes in sea water density anomalies is com-
mensurable with or less than the accuracy of its determination. Accordingly.
it is desirable that the filtering of these fields be carried out by scans

of moving averaging over the area.

In the interval between the upper and lower boundaries of the thermocline
the weighting factors were determined from the conditions of linear conver-
sion from the smoothing formlas to averaging. This makes it possible for
the coefficients eye; to propose the formulas

When carrying out computations the error in stipulating the smoothed val-
ues of the density field was evaluated at 10‘5 g/cm3. a-(u(ll)). d(v(ll))
- 3 cm/sec, whereas the accuracy in stipulating bottom relief. which was
determined from the atlas (3]. was assumed equal to 10 m.

It should be noted that in this method the computed values of the dispersions
of currents (diagonal elements of the covariation matrix R(V)) characterize
the consistency of equation (1) with the a priori information on current
velocities at the reference horison, represented in equations (2) and (3).
Information on the errors in stipulating the initial data is used in deter-
mining the statistical weights of equations (l)-(3). For example, the in-
crease in the errors in stipulating bottom relief and to a somewhat lesser
degree the density field of sea water leads to a decrease in the statis-
tical weight of equation (1), whereas an increase in the cr(u(u)). cr(v(n))
values reduces the statistical weights of equations (2) and (3). If the
computed values OKu) and cf(v) constitute not more than 201. this means that
within the limits of accuracy of the geostrophic model of the circulation of
waters. with allowance for the error in stipulating the initial data, equa-
tion (1) and the a priori information. written in the form of equations (2)-
(3), do not contradict one another.

The following parameter was introduced for characterizing the accuracy of
the computed values of the current vectors

representing an evaluation of the relative error in determining the modulus
of the velocity vector. The computations of currents made for 1' squares
are represented in the figure in the form of maps of summer and winter
(northern hemisphere) circulations of waters at the surface of the investig-
ated part of the Indian Ocean.

 

On these maps the information on the accuracy of the computed fields of water
circulation was plotted in the following way. The results were divided into
three groups with respect to the )’coefficient. The first included the vec-
tors with ‘YE [0. 302]. the second -- with YEIBO, 602]. and the third --
with Y) 601. The notation of the vectors belonging to the first and second
groups is given in explanations to the figure. The vectors belonging to the
third group have not been plotted on the map, as a result of which gaps were
formed in several places on them.

An analysis of the results indicated that the first group included #31. the
second group 662 and the third group 232 of the computed values of the cur-
rent vectors. It follows from this fact that in determining currents at the
surface in the overwhelming majority of cases the assumption of the absence
of velocities in the bottom layer fully agrees with the geostrophic model
of circulation of waters represented in the form of equation (5).

Computations of the )’evaluation and the introduction of three gradations of
the current vectors relative to this parameter made possible a graphic dis-
crimination on the maps of those regions with a small. moderate and also

considerable level of error in the results. which substantially simplifies
carrying out the analysis of the constructed pattern of water circulation.

In the overwhelming majority of cases the current vectors belonging to the
second and third groups were situated in zones of weak horizontal flows, in
the shelf zone or in the equatorial zone. that is. precisely where disruption
of the geostrOphic balance was entirely regular. with respect to cases of the
appearance of vectors of the second and third groups in regions with powerful
clearly expressed flows, such as the Southern Trades Current (SIC). this
fact. in all probability, was caused by the poor consistency of the density
field and bottom relief.

how we will proceed to a geostrophic analysis of the resulting maps of cur-
rents. According to existing concepts [5], in the northern hemisphere the
most significant element in the circulation of waters is the monsoonal cur-
rent. but to this time it has not been possible to discriminate a unified

flow of this current in geostrophic circulation computations [9]. Now this cur-
rent is expressed quite clearly in the results (see Fig. 1). From winter to
summer it changes the direction of its movement. reversing itself; it intens-
ifies considerably (from 10-15 cm/sec in winter to 25-30 cm/sec in summer).
and bending around Sri Lenka from the southeast. gives rise to the East Hindu-
stan Current. The latter. as indicated by computations. also changes consid-
erably from season to season (from 5-15 culsec in winter to 18-25 cm/sec in
sum-er). which in turn leads to an intensification of the anticyclonic cit-
culation of waters in the Bay of Bengal. Such a sequence in relationships in

the circulation system and a numerical evaluation of the variability of the
transport of waters were not given earlier in the literature.

During winter it is possible to trace the surface equatorial countercurrent.
whose powerful flow penetrates from west to east to the shores of Sumatra
between 2 and ﬁ‘ﬂ. having velocities fro: 20 to 50 cm/sec. It should be noted
that in computations made earlier [9] this phenomenon could not he discrimin-
ated. although its existence has been mentioned in a number of studies [5.
6]. In the summer in the area of the Andaman See it is easy to trace the
transport of waters primarily of a northerly direction, with a width of 350-
650 kn and an extent of more than 1000 km with velocities of about 10 cm/
sec. which is impaired in winter. The mentioned peculiarity of circulation
was found for the first time in computations of geostrophic currents in this
basin.

South of the equator (Fig. 1), between 8 and 10's. a branch of the STC is
clearly manifested; it extends from is: to "NH. During summer it intensifies
to 60 cm/sec and adjoins the shores of Java. In winter the axis of the STC is
traced somewhat to the south and along the shores of Java there is water
transport in an easterly direction. Such a transformation of the surface cir-
culation systes is evidently attributable to the change in the wind regime

of this region. The results agree well with the data published by V. G. Kort

[5].

To the north and south of the axis of the 810 it is easy to discriminate
quasiststionary eddy formations. which confirms modern concepts concerning
the dynamics of waters in this region [5. 12]. The sign of vorticity of these
circulations makes it possible to judge the vertical movements of waters in

these regions: to the north of the main flow of the S‘rC there is a predom-
inance of cyclonic (southern henisphere) eddies (upwelling of waters in
the south equatorial divergence). and to the south -- anticyclonic eddies
(subsidence of waters in the convergence region).

In sue-arising these investigations we note the following:

1. In diagnostic coaputations for the first tine it was possible to obtain
such significant elenents of the circulation of waters as the unified flow
of the nonsoonal current. smer intensification of the equatorial counter-
current for the distance fro- 80'! to the shores of Sumatra and seasonal
aoveaent of the src relative to the shores of Java. which were mentioned
earlier in the literature. Quantitative evaluations of the spatial-tenporsl
(seasonal) variability of the enuaerated flows were given.

2. The noted agreenent of the results of amputations r. .d date from the pre-
ceding investigations indicates the effectiveness of the procedures used in
the processing of in situ observations and therefore they can be recon-ended
for broader introduction in the practice of oceanographic research.

3. The interrelationship between su-er intensification of anticyclonic cir-
culation of waters in the Bay of Bengal and intensification of the aonsoonal

current was clarified .

lo. A flow of northerly direction with a width of 350-650 In and an extent of
more than 1000 Ian, not previously described in the literature, was found to
exist in smer in the Andaman Sea.

[Abstrlctl The author has ascertained the correlation function of the field of
a dissolved passive impurity in the open part of the sea on the basis of the
correlation function for the salinity field. In addition, it was possible to
ascertain the mean field of an inurity in the mouth regions of rivers on the
basis of the lean salinity field. finally. a method was defined for determin-
ing the self-purifying capacity of the sea medium by neans of study of the
field of a conservative marker. In the first part of the paper it is Shown

that with a known correlation function of the salinity field and a known self-
purifying capacity of the medium it is possible to ascertain the correlation
function of the field of a passive dissolved impurity; the fornula derived

for this purpose is simple if a stationarity of field fluctuations is assumed.
otherwise the analysis is more difficult. The discussion of the river south
zone in the sea focuses on the behavior of a passive dissolved inurity trans-
ported by river waters. the assuption being nsde that the river is the sole
source of entry of the impurity into the considered part of the sea. An expres-
sion is derived for explaining the behavior of the inurity on the assumption
that there is a col-on nechanisn for the propagation of fresh vater and the
impurity. If the nean salinity field in the dilution zone has been described

it is possible to describe the seen field of the transported ispurity by knoving
only the background concentrations and the nonconservativity index. The pro-
posed methods are relatively sisple because observations of the salinity field
are not difficult and salinity is a conservative marker of hydrochenical fields.
having data on the statistical structure of the fields of salinity and contam-
inating substances it is possible to evaluate the self~purifying capacity of
the sea medium. References: 5 Russian. '

[Text] Abstract: The authors analyse the results of
temperature sounding of the quite thin water-
air interface obtained by the Multidiscipline
Eastern Expedition of the Geography Faculty.
ibscow State University, in the Sea of Japan
in July-August 1980. The existence of nolec-
ular theml conductivity film in the water
(5" - 0.001-0.003 n) and in the air (5, -

0.0005 I) was noted with a nean ratio:
83/8, - 1/2 - 1/3. For the first tine for

urine conditions it was possible to obtain
enpirical dependences of the deviations of
water radiation taperature. introduced by the
file (AT), from the reaper-cure of the subsur-
face water in dependence on the total heat
flow (03,) and wind velocity at a height of
10-3 0:. with "10 - 34.5 nlsec «Ar - 2.6-
10-3 Q s with correlation coefficients 0.93 and
0.90. The applicability of the correlation co-
efficient value A - 0.25 between the Russelt
and hayleigh nubers is denonstrated; this
ashes it possible to deternine AT during
call weather and periods of little wind.

Tue basis for the design of the ewloyed thernosonde was the work of Ye. c.
Andreyev and G. G. Khundzhua [2]. Registry was in the coastal zone of the sea
from a stall float at a distance of 20-30 a fron the ship; this eeall float
was connected to the ship's side by a cable which was supported by other
can floats. The relative temperature was registered at the sane tine by an
auto-tic recorder at a scale of 1:1 and was photographed fron the screen of
an oscillogreph. The sensor used was a copper-droplet thernoconple with a wire

using the foreula [9]

where 9 is the thermal inertia tine of the sensing junction of the thermo-
couple. detersined experimentally (2.0v10'3 sec). v is the rate of subaergence
of the teaperature sensor. 31/32 is the neasured tenperature gradient.

The depth of subaergence of the thermosonde in the sea is -0.10 a. There was
registry of about 600 continuous teeperature profiles in the water and air
from the float in series with sounding intervals of 1-2 ninutes.

Parallely with operation of the theraosonde, specialists on the ship at inter-
vals of 15-30 minutes carried out observations of air humidity. wind and water
temperature at the horizon 0.5 a.

In order to systelatire the tsnperature profiles the observation oeriod was
broken down into several groups. The principal criterion in discriminating the
groups was wind conditions. Other characteristics (eo-elo -- the difference in
saturation elasticity directly over the water and water vapor saturation elas-
ticity at a height of 10 n; T; - T. -- the temperature difference between
water at a depth of 0.6 a and air temperature at a height of 10 n) to a greater
or lesser degree changed as a result of changes in wind speed.

The tesperature profiles were registered at two scales: on the automatic record-

er ar a scale of 1:1 and with 10* enlargement on the photographed oscillograph
screen. ’ ’ ‘3 ‘r‘

In most cases there was registry of a cold film (ST - 1-3'c (about 702 of
the cases). In many cases the film had a poorly expressed character; in 101
of the cases there was a wars file with AT up to 3'0.

The thickness of the surface temperature film changed constantly with time
(from 0 to 0.006 m); there was also a change in the temperature drop in it.
Thus, a film is a pulsating natural formation.

An attempt was made to find the value of the teaperature correction le in-
troduced by the film to the teaperature of the sea surface at different wind
velocity and heat balance values for the surface water layer of about 0.003
m. Two computation schemes were used. In the first the balance was computed
using the standard method using the formulas for the heat flow due to evapor-
ation and condensation QB and contact heat exchange 03 [S]:

Q.- 5. s7 :04 (ox-+0. 0'77 U...) (c.—'e'..7. (2)
Qu" — 3.87 10"(0.2G + 0.07? Us“ Tm " T. ‘- (3)

Effective radiation Qeff was computed using oceanographic tables with the use
of the observed cloud cover and humidity values. The purpose of processing of
the results was an examination of the convergence of the sign of the sum Q;
+ Q“ + Qeff and the "sign" of the film. The result indicated a partial con-
vergence of the signs. A hypothesis can be formulated along these lines.

The excessively strong simplification of the computation scheme did not make
it possible to achieve sufficiently precise results. The computations were
complicated also by the fact that 202 of the measurements were made in a fog
and more than 302 under calm conditions. The accuracy of formulas (2) and (3)
under these conditions is considerably reduced. There is no correction for

a fog for the computation formulas. Many researchers have met with such dif-
ficulties [6].

The second computation scheme involved computing the total heat flow in the
temperature gradient in the part of the temperature profile which is close to
linear, directly bounding with the water-air surface. The sector of molecular
thereal conductivity is sometises identified with a linear temperature dis-
tribution. but this is correct only under stationery conditions. Aasuaing
that the boundary of the phases does not have a thickness and there is no
heat accumulation in it. we can write the expression

The temperature gradient necessary for the computations is determined from the
oscillograph photographs. With respect to the flow of solar heat (Q ), for the
heat balance of the film the only factor of importance is its absorption within
the limits of the film (0. 001-0. 003 m). This absorption was not taken into ac-
count in our work (as in many other investigations. such as [9]) and this did
not make it possible to determine the conditions for foreation of the warm

fllm. Data on the absorption of radiation in the layer 0.001 m are given in
[8]. The values of the Q; parameter, regardless of the method for its deter-
aination. make it possible to check and refine the formulas relating the
total temperature drop in the film (including the linear and nonlinear parts
of the profile) with the wind and heat balance. We note the circumstance
that when determining Q; from the tuperature gradient use was not made of
the total temperature drop, but the tangent of the profile slope in its
"linear" part in contact with the sea surface.

The Saunders formula [12] has come into wide use; it is based on the theory
of dimensionalities

where 1/ is the nolecular kinematic viscosity of water, 6 is wind shearing
stress, ,0" is water density. ;\ is the coefficient of molecular thermal
conductivity. 1: is a dimensionless coefficient which, according to the

are based on allowance for all high waters "of practical significance" and the
application of objective methods for extrapolation of the integral probability

[Abstract] The authors propose a numerical method for computing the unsteady
notion of cohesive (highly concentrated) mudflows. making use of appropriate-
ly adapted St. Venant equations. As indicated in this paper. the preparation
of the computer progrss for this purpose requires the setting of clear initial
and boundary conditions. The unsteady motion of a cohesive mudflow along a
watercourse can be divided roughly into three main phases: ”beginning of
motion." "motion along the channel” and "stoppage” when gravitational and other
forces put an end to the motion. It is shown that each of these phases has its
peculiarities with respect to the mathematical formulation of the problem,
preparation of the program and its subsequent realisation. The most difficult
task. the assignment of initial and boundary conditions, must be done in such
a way that thereafter in all sectors and within these sectors it will be pos-
sible to determine the indices of the dynamics of flow, depth and velocity of
motion. The limitations inpoaed in this problen are very significant and to
some extent they seem to sake the modeled phenomenon unrealistic. but no other
solution seems possible. The method proposed here. on the other hand. does seem
to afford a possibility for predicting LL: principal dynamic and geometrical
indices of the flow in both ties and space, which is very important for the
rational placement of protective antimudflow structures in the channel and on
the floodplain. The method essentially involves solving a difference analogue
of a system of quasilinear equations in partial derivatives of the hyperbolic
type. The Courant condition is satisfied during the computations for different
relationships of space and tine grid intervals. This also involves application
of a special procedure based on truncation of the flow depth value as the so-

[Abstract] There is a recognised need for a detailed assessnent of the re-
ceipts of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the territory of Cen-
tral Asia. The authors therefore undertook a detailed description of the en-
ergy resources of the desert territory of the country and analysed the ef-
fectiveness of use of solar energy by different types of pastures in rhe lov-
land part of the republics of Central Asia. the area of the Rarskun and Ky:-
ylkun deserts. The receipts of PAR were cosputed by the connonly enployed In.
K. Ross nethod. Different formulas are used for clear and cloudy conditions.
In this region the distribution of total radiation and PAR conforns to the
laws of latitudinal zonality. The suns of PAR were conputed for each nonth.
year and for the active growing season of desert-pasture vegetation for all
points where standard meteorological observations are nade. During the grow-
ing season the PAR suns vary froa 55 Cal/ca2 in the north to 35 Cal/en2 in
the south (Fig. l is a ﬂap of the distribution of PAR). This nap showing

PAR receipts during the growing season reflects not only the patterns of dis-
tribution of solar radiation, but also the distribution of air tenperature.
However. in years differing in neteorological conditions the PAR suns deviate
from the scan long-tern values. An inportant index characterising plant pro-
ductivity with respect to their photosynthetic activity is the solar energy
utilization factor; Table I gives the suns of PAR fro. the date of spring
transition of aesn daily air tenperature through o‘c to the date of the laxi-
nun height of the grass stand; Table 2 gives the solar radiation utilization
factors for different types of pastures. In years with optinun noistening the
utilization factor increases to 0.3. whereas in years of drought it decreases
to 0.06. Plants of these arid and seniorid regions are characterised by ex-
trenely low solar energy utilization factors. Figures 2, tables 2; references

[Abstract] The problen of the conditions and sechanisn of generation of ice
particles near 002 particles still remains unclear. In particular. this is true
of the evaluation of the degree of water vapor supersaturation arising as a re-
sult of the cooling effect of solid CO . In this paper it is demonstrated that
the widely accepted belief that there is an identity of the conditions for the
generation of ice crystals near the surface of an evaporating particle of sol-
id co; and the surface of a nonevaporating body of the same tesperature is err-
oneous. This is true because other researchers have neglected the diffusion of
€02 gas forning as a result of the evaporation of solid C02, eating the as-
sumption that in the entire sons of the cooling effect the vapor elasticity is
equal to the elasticity of vapor in the cloud. In actuality. vapor elasticity
in the zone of the effect is a function of temperature, whose field is forned
as a result of the mixing of dry and cold €02 gas and moist relatively were
air. The discussion reveals clearly that the probability of the fornation of
ice particles near the surface of solid co; is greater than near water par-
ticles. Accordingly, the neglecting of the mixing effect can lead to consider—
able errors in coeputations of the number of ice heterophase nuclei forsing
near the cooling surface of solid 00; as a reagent in the artificial sodific-
ation of supercooled clouds and fogs and therefore there will be errors in
evaluating the total probability of fornation of ice particles in the entire
zone of artificial sodification. Thhles 1; references 7: 6 Russian. 1 Uestern.

IAbstract] The authors propose a fundamentally new means for intensifying
crystallization in clouds related to the change in conditions for the intro-
duction of reagents. It is clear that by increasing supersaturation in some
local zone of injection of a reagent into a cloud it is possible to achieve

a considerable decrease in the critical size of heterophase (2- and 3-dimen-
sional) nuclei and therefore bring about an increase in the number of active
reagent particles. The method involves creation of a local supersaturation

by use of a jet of supersaturated steam. The authors first examine the crys-
tallizing effect of the supersaturated vapor itself. During 1975-1979 new lab-
oratory experiments were carried out in a fog chamber under a wide range of
conditions. The chamber temperature was varied in the range froe -S to -25°C.
A high-velocity jet of supersaturated vapor was created in a specially devel-
oped steam generator. The jet had a supersonic velocity. The experiments re-
vealed that the activity of the vapor as a crystallizing agent increases sharp-
ly due to a decrease in the cross section of the jet or an increase in the es-
cape velocity of the jet. The temperature dependence of the crystallizing ac-
tivity of the water vapor was similar to that observed for well-known re-
agents such as silver iodide. ﬂowever. the absolute value of the ice~forming
activity of the vapor is still considerably lower than the activity of the
presently employed crystallising reagents. Nevertheless, there are definite
possibilities for increasing the activity of the vapor by an increase in the
velocity of the jet and a simultaneous increase in the intensity of its inter-
action with the medium. A combined method can be employed: use of crystalliz-
ing reagents introduced into the chamber together with a jet of supersaturated
water vapor. Experiments were carried out with two such reagents. This enhanced
the crystalliting effect. Figures 3; references 5: i Russian, 1 Western.

ago when it was determined that organochloride pesticides (DDT. eldrin, diel-

animals the authorities in Great Britain adopted measures for restricting the
use of these substances. Unfortunately, there was no provision for enforce-
Isent. It is now clear that the desired results have not been forthconing. The
statistics reveal that the mean annual quantity of organochloride pesticides
used in Great Britain between 1975 and 1979 was 51 greater than between 1971
and 1976. There evidently has been no appreciable decline. for sxasple, in
