Abstract. lnsolations at different latitudes for the
smear and winter caloric half years. created by oscil-
lations in the el-snts of hrth's orbit for the period
froe -l to cl eillion years and teeporsl spectra of the
oscillations of these elseents. and anoealies of inso-
lstion at different latitudes are coeputed. dseonstrated
and conpered with clieate oscillations. Especial atten-
tion is focused on the spectral peaks at periods l00.000,
41.000. 23.000. and 19,000 years.

L‘rext] Iii-stone cuparisons for the course of peleotaperaturee and inso-
lations in the Pleistocene that have been nods beginning with the known works
of Hilsliiovich [1] and mu recently (see en. bibliography [243) indicate
the presence of an analogy between the course of these curves. This analogy
is interpreted as proof in support of the astrono-ical theory of cliaate oscil-
lations. The latter is based. as is brown, on the sssunption of the hey

influence on clients of insolstions un-biguously linked to the pastry of
planetary orbit.

It goes without saying that an erhanstive response to the question should
clieate oscillations in the Pleistocene be viewed as forced and as a reaction
precisely to oscillations in insolation can he obtained only in nusricsl
experieents in which. with other conditions equal the ele-ents of Barth's
orbit will vary. For the present it ie expedient to uploy a spectral anal-
ysis directly for tuporel seriesnpertorhed values of Earth's orbit eleeents
and insoletion--and coapsre the findings with the available data on clieate
oscillatione in the Pleistocene, without setting the goal of explaining the
eechanise for the reaction of the clients system to the external factor--
variation in the orbit ole-outs.

Such a work. being as if a preparation for the construction of a nodal of
clinate oscillations in the Pleistocene, in our opinion is of independent
ieportance. In fact. a spectral analysis provides additional information on
the course of the process. Thus. for ample. a conparison of the tnporal
spectra of oscillations in meteorological eluenta and certain geophysical
pareneters in the area of periods on the order of tens of years L6. 7] has
Iade it possible to find the sinilarity of tenporal spectre referring to
different geological eraeufron the Paleozoic era to the nodern period.

1. Calculation of Oscillations in Bluents of Earth's Orbit

In the franeworl: of the astrononical theory of clinate Ll] the quantity of
solar radiation enteriu the upper border of the atnosphere. and its distri-
bution over the surface of the sphere is a function of the solar constant 80,
the large seniaxis of planetary orbit a, period of revolution of the planet
around the sun 'I', as well as three paranoters characterizing geonetry of the
orbit--eccentricity a. slope of the equator towards the ecliptic E . and longi-
tude of the perihelion of the planetary orbit n. Thus pinpointing the calcu-
lation of inaolation can be attained both by neans of a sore accurate selec-
tion olfl. the constants‘ 8°.a and ‘l'. and by neans of refining the solution e.

e and

He will briefly ermine the technique of calculating Earth's orbit ale-ants.

As the nain we take the nova-ant obtained during the solution of the proble-
of two bodies-othe eaanlned planet and the sun. Conputation of the distur.
bones inpoeed on the Xeplerian now-ant as a consequence of interaction with
other planets is carried out by the nethod of successive approrinations. "ith
the use of the nethod propoued by Lagrange the perturbation function is linited
by its secular portion (all periodic terns that contain in their argunents
near. longitudss or seen anmalies are rejected). In the first approxination
during breakdown of the perturbation function terns are considered not above
the second order relative to the eccentricitiee and slopes. Then the solu-
tions (perturbed values of orbital ale-ants) are obtained in the for. of trigo-
nonetric functions of tine. These solutions are useful on a tine interval

on the order of several nillions of years. In order to avoid the difficulties
developing in an integration of the Lagrangian equations, when the planetary
eccentricity e or inclination i are small, it is custonary to replace the

variables of“, 1.0 (longitude of the ascending point) with the following
expressions:

h - a sin n - ZMangaﬁl).

k - 9 cos n - EM. cosml-l-ﬂl). (I)

A conperieon of the aolutione that differ only in the valuee of planetary

with spacing of 5, years for a tine interval of lo aillion years centered
relative to the epoch l9$0.0. Thus the calculations encompass a period of

the Pleistocene (the border between the Pleistocene and the Pliocene is ads
by the najority of authors along the paleuagnetic episode of Olduvey. i.e.
roughly 1.8 nillion years ago). The solution [8.9] is preemted in an ana-
Lymd (ones a linear coabination of trigononetric functions. Consideration
for the lunar-solar precession results in the need to use a large III-her of

The values of the coefficients in these series given in the cited works show
that for C the uplitudee of five terns (i-l-S) exceed 0.05 and the main is
the period about (01,000 years; in the expression for a sin 11 there are four
terns (1-2-5) with anplitude greater than 0.01, and the main are the periods
about 23.000 and 19,000 years; for oscillations and eccentricity e the aain is
the period about 100,000 years.

A spectral analysis nade it possible to reveal aore clearly the nature of the
secular oscillations in orbital elements. It is apparent from figure 1 that
the spectrum 6e a-uninodal, with peak of the period “.000 years, in the
spectrua 6(e sinnlo-binodal-otwo inportant precession peaks are foundnst
periods 23,000 and ".000. He note that the period of secular oscillations
in the eccentricity on the order 100.000 years practically is not Ianifest in
the spectru- of perturbed value of the product 6 (e sinn). Variations in
the orbital el-ents have a quasiperiodic nature; the calculations Iade for
the period 2 nillion years ahead (ago) from the epoch l950.0 provided prac-
tically comident values of the periods. At the sale tile analysis of the
tenporal course of orbital elements shows that on individual te-poral inter-
vals the doninant periods will differ (especially on the tine interval 600.000-
l nillion years ago. where the values of eccentricity e are very seall). The
spectrum of the perturbed value of eccentricity of Earth‘s orbit hes the
next-u- near the period 100,000 years (figure 2).

Paris AIR 3T 608308 in French 31 Mar 79 p 52
[Article: "French Experiments in Space Metallurgy on Board '8alyut-6'"]

[Text] Ten French experiments in metallurgy under conditions of weightless-
ness of the "RIM" program are going to be carried out within the framework
of the Franco-Soviet spatial cooperation, prepared by French scientific
laboratories on board the orbital station ”8a1yut-6."

These experiments, which began on 25 March, using the first samples brought
by the Soviet cargo vessel "Progress V,“ will be carried out-dike all
successive ones--in the Soviet ovens "Splav" and "Kristal" of the station.
The crew of the "8a1yut-6" will put into the ovens cartridges containing
samples of materials and will attend to programming the ovens' operations.
The duration of the cycles of temperature will extend from few hours to
several tens of hours; the samples will then be brought back to the ground
and analysed by the experimental laboratories.

The experiments will deal with, on the one hand, the growth of crystals,
starting from the gaseous phase, and from the liquid or liquid solution
phase. The problem is to study, under the conditions of microgravity exist-
ing on board the "8alyut-6," the formation of different types of mono-
crystals starting from liquid spheres placed in position: cellular and
dendritic solidification of aluminua or tin-based alloys, the synthesis of
alloys with magnetic properties based on rare earths (neodyas-cobalt and
cerium-manganese compounds), and the growth of germanium in the gaseious

phase.

They are also concerned with the formation of semi-conductors with nonocrys-
tals: From the spatial environment and the absence of convection in fluids
a better control of conditions of crystal growth is expected, leading to

an improvement in the quality of the crystals. The materials studied are
oxyde of vanadium gallium araenious compounds, and phosphorus alloyed

with gallium and with indium.

The experiments were prepared by the Solid Chemistry laboratories of the
CRIBS [National Scientific Research Center] in Bordeaux, the Diffusion and
Technology of Material Service of the cans in neudon-Bellevue, the laboratory
of the Physics of Solidification of the Institute of Fundamental Research

of the can in Grenoble and the Laboratory of Magneusm of the cans in
Grenoble.

IMPROVING THE MICIENCY 0? TN! UTILIZATION OF URANIUM IN THE REM-1000

[Article by I.Ya. Yemel'yanov. A.D. Zhirnov. v.1. Puehkarev and A.P. Sirotkin]

[Text] Increasing unit power is one of the ways of inproving the econonic
effectiveness of an ABS. he applied to M's [high-power channel re-
actors), this has been reflected in the develop-mt of the ”MK-1500. RINK-2000
and RING-2600. The ability to increase the capacity of an ”MK-1000 channel
by a factor of 1.5 by the intensification of heat exchange has been realized
in the mat-1500. where the power has thereby been increased to 1500 m (elec-
trical) without changing the overall dineneions and design of the reactor.

In the design for the ”HR-2000 the diameter of the channel was increased.
along with the nunber of fuel elaents in it and the lattice spacing. which
has made it possible to develop within the overall dinensions of the ”HR-1000
a reactor of double the power. 2000 IN (electrical). The creation of en
increased-capacity channel has opened up new opportunities for improving tech-
nical and economic characteristics. such as increasing the degree of burnup
and reducing the consuqation of TVS's [fuel assemblies] and the specific con-
sunption of natural uranium

The experience of utilizing uranitm-graphite reactors [1. 2] has demonstrated
that it is possible for the fuel in then to be reloaded continuously in opera-
tion. This has Iade it possible to avoid considerable changes in reactivity
in the process of the reactor's operation. to reduce the unproductive capture
of neutrons in control rods. and thereby to increase the integral power genera-
tion and degree of fuel burnup with low enrichnent of uraniun. As denonstrated
by physical and technical and economic estimates for an ”MK-1000 [3. 1.], with
the current cost of fuel and of asking fuel eleeents. the minimal fuel con-
ponent of inputed costs for the generation of electric power, a , occurs with
initial enrich-eat of 1.8 to two percent. Meanwhile, it has been proven by
calculations that with greater enrichesnt and with the reactor operating in

the continuous reloading node the capacity of freshly loaded channels is in-
creased and the length of tin the fuel remains in the reactor is extended.

0n the basis of the available data, and taking into account the fact that,
first. there had not been sufficient experience in the utilization of fuel

ale-enta with a high degree of hurnup (approximately 25 to 30 m'day/kg u)

with linear loads of 300 to 400 "Ice and a five-year period for remaining

in the reactor. and. second, the nininun for 2 had been expreeaed loosely.
the relatively conservative decision was made t5 use fuel with a 1.8-percent
enrich-ant (table 1) in the nan-1000 for the steady-state continuous reloading
node. The uployasnt of ‘t as the optisization criterion is to a certain
extent arbitrary.

The experience in operating the first mac-1000'. has demonstrated that

the fuel element and TL. design which has been created has a definite poten-
tial, both in terms of linear loads on fuel elements end of the ultimate
capacity (in relation to critical heat exchange conditions) of the channel.

In addition, the stability of power distribution is reduced in proportion to
the burnup of fuel and the removal from the reactor of supplementary absorbents
compensating the initial excess reactivity. As demonstrated by calculations

nuclei to moderator nuclei. Improvements in the ratio of fuel and moderator
nuclei in operating reactors are achieved by increasing the enrichment, and in
reactors being designed it is possible to reduce the moderator nuclei. e.g.,
by reducing the lattice spacing or the effective density of the moderator.

Increasing the degree of fuel enrichment results in an increase in the degree
of fuel burnup and in modification of a improving field stability, and in

a reduction in the consumption of fuel and fuel elements. An increase in

the degree of enrichment and the improvement in the degree of burnup in keeping
with it in turn are responsible for an increase in the capacity of a freshly
loaded channel, in the length of time the fuel stays in the reactor, and in
linear loads on a fuel element. The feasibility of increasing the capacity

of a channel by a factor of 1.5 has been confirmed by the creation of the
”MK-1500 channel. The data presented in table 2 must be regarded mainly

as comparative, and not absolute. for the calculations were performed for the _
steady-state fuel reloading mode. In determining the capacity of live channels,
variation factors I: and I: were used, gotten by taking into account the
experience in utilizing the Rita-1000, and calculated reloading factors. For
reactors operating with fuel with 1.8-percent enrichment, the variation factor
for the radius, 1: , was named to equal 1.1., and the variation factor for

the height, In; , LI» also. 0n the basis of the experience in utilizing the
RINK-1000, the root-mean-square error in determining and maintaining the
channel capacity, a , was assumed to equal 5.2 percent, and the linear load

on a fuel element, 5 . 7.7 percent. In calculating the annual consumption

of natural and enriched fuel it was seemed that the load factor, 0 , equaled
0.8 and the content of 2350 in an enrichment plant dump, 0.25 percent. The
return of 2350 from spent fuel into the fuel cycle was not taken into account.
Thus, increasing the enrichment of fuel in an RINK-1000 is a realistic method
of improving the efficiency of its utilization. furthermore, from the view-
point of permissible channel capacities and linear loads on a fuel element,
enrichment as much as 3.6 percent is possible. A solution to increasing the
capacity of the channel and linear loads on a fuel element by as much as a
factor of 1.5 has been found in the ram-1500 [5, 6]. In this case the TVS's
were supplied with heat exchange intensifiers. There are no changes in the
design of the channel or in delivery and discharge lines. With a more moderate
increase in enrichment and, consequently. channel capacity, 'rvs's without

intensifiers can be used. l’or example. it is possible to convert to two-
percent enrichment of fuel without any design changes in “8's. The maximum
values of capacities presented in table 2 were obtained on the assumption
that the power equalization algorithm for the core is kept the same as in
existing smut-1000's. In addition. measures can be suggested (some of which
have already undergone experimental verification with reactors) which make it
pODllbln' to broaden the ability to equalize the distribution of power in the
core. Under this heading can come the utilization of absorbing rods loaded
into fresh WS's and removed as the power of the channel is reduced. the

cedure. and the like. A definite potential for the equalization of pmr
distribution is entailed in a possible increase in the operating reactivity
margin caused by the mode of operation of the A28 in the power system.

Increasing the enrichment results in a reduction in the consumption of fuel
elements and natural uranium. The annual consumption of fuel elements in
shifting froa variant to variant is reduced by 20 to 30 percent. and is reduced
twofold when employing three-percent enrichment. The consumptitn of natural
uranium with this degree of enrichment is reduced by 20 tons and equals 150
tons per year. The content of 3350 in spent fuel is reduced to 0.25 percent.
i.e.. to the amount of enrichment plant dumps. and when 3.6-percent enricheent
is employed. to 0.2 percent. which eliminates the question of the necessity of
extracting it from the spent fuel. Increasing the initial enrichment con-
sidersbly alters the void coefficient. reducing it in comparison with 1.8-
percent enrichment and shifting it to the negative side. This improves the
stability of power distribution. but requires special consideration under
transient conditions.

Hheress alteration of these parameters (channel capacity. linear load on

fuel element. change in void coefficient) does not give rise to doubts re-
garding the ability to increase the enricheent. increasing the degree of
burnup to 60 to 45 MH-day/hg 0 and the calendar period for the fuel elesents

to remain in the core to 10 to 12 years with three- and 3.6-percent enrichment.
respectively. requires special research and confirmation. although the creation
of fuel elements with an oxide fuel burnup of 65 to 50 MHoday/hg u can be
considered realistic (7. 8]. It is more difficult to ensure the vitality of
fuel elements under reactor conditions over an extended period.

Increasing the capacity of the channel by a factor of 1.5 has unveiled new
prospects for the near-loco and has substantially improved the economic in-
dicators of the fuel cycle on account of the increase in the degree of fuel
enrichment. The utilization in the tank-1000 of fuel with 2.5- to three-per-
cent enrichment requires the creation of and the experimental confirmation

of the efficiency of fuel elements enabling a degree of burnup of 40 MHoday/
/kg 0 and having a guaranteed life of about 10 years in the core. Ihie re-
presents one line along which experimental design and research work must be
done with regard to imprcving the RINK-1000.

[Article by D. P. Lobanov: "Sixtieth Anniversary of the Moscow Geo-
logical Exploration Institute imeni Sergo Ordzhonikidzc"]

[Text] Early in 1919. the most difficult year of the struggle against
the enemies of the revolution, a ceremony was held opening the Moscow
Mining Academy (Has). The first students began studying in its de-
partments of geological exploration. mining. and metallurgy. This
unique higher educational institution. a child of Great October. was
established by the 6 September 1918 Decree of the Soviet of People's
Commissars thanks to the exceptional far-sightedness of V. I. Lenin.
Better than anyone else he saw clearly that future successes in the
development of industry required timely preparation of engineering
and scientific workers in the fields of exploration. exploitation,
and processing of mineral raw materials. The establisheent of the
Moscow Mining Academy and preparation of highly qualified mining geo-
logical specialists at it played an enormous part in the development
of mineral products in the young Republic of °~wiotc c-d served the
cause of furthering mining geological education in our country.

Sixty years have passed already since that unforgettable. heroic
time. But the greater the time that separates us from the sources
of Vladimir Il'ich Lenin's many remarkable initiatives. the greater
the need of the heirs of this majestic history to relate how the
behests of the great leader are being carried out.

The collective of the Moscow Geological Exploration Institute (MGR!)
is carrying on and multiplying the glorious traditions of its parent
institution. the department of geological exploration of MGA and

its outstanding padsgogs and teachers. widely recognized and in-
valuable contributions to the early development of MGA and the de-
velopment of geological exploration education were made by world-
femous scientists. committed people who fought to carry out Lenin's
ideas of developing our country's natural resources: acadeeicians

Zavaritskiy. S. s. Smirnov. M. A. Usov. and many others took active
parts in shaping the first syllebi. curricula. and courses and in
developing teaching methods. Their scientific ideas have now been
greatly elaborated. but they continue to have an isportant influence
on the training of engineering and scientific specialists. we will
always remember the constant attention that the Moscow Nining

Academy. an important sector of the struggle for the victory of the
October Revolution. received from leaders of the party and government
such as comrades N. I. Kalinin. A. V. Lunacharskiy. S. H. Budennyy.
and other political figures of the 1920's. Their remarkable speeches
in the halls of "CA were a real education in revolution for the stu-
dents and teachers.

At a ceremony on 12 February 1923 dedicated to the fourth anniversary
of "GA. honorary student H. l. Kalinin said. "This is a new front. a
front of conquest. to conquer heavy industry. A great deal depends on
what you are like when you leave this Academy." And the graduates of
HGA indeed contributed a great deal to the final victory of the
October Revolution. laid the foundation of heavy industry. and by
heroic labor brought the great Lenin's designs to reality.

For graduates of HGA-Mcll in all subsequent years the challenges of
building socialism and communism in our country grew steadily more
complex. The scale of mining geological work increased rapidly and
they were always assisted by the glorious history of their prede-
cessors and the enormous attention given by the Communist Party to
problems of developing the mineral raw material base in all stages.
Overcoming inconceivable difficulties caused by the economic devasta-
tion which was inherited from Old Russia and the Civil Var. in itr
first 10 years the geological exploration department graduated 290
Soviet mining engineering geologists. This is an impressive figure
if one bears in mind that in 1912 the entire Russian Empire had just
565 specialists in the field of geology. and only about 250 spe-
cialiets in mining geology and geological exploration. He take pride
today in noting that among the graduates of "GA in those years were
the remarkable pedagogs B. l. Vozdvizhenskiy. 3. Ya. Herenkov, A. N.
Ovchinnikov. D. I. Shchegolev. Ye. Ye. Zakharov, G. N. Popov. S. S.
Panchev. S. H. Shorokhov. and A. I. Nilovanov.

A decision of the Presidium of the All-Union Soviet of People's Com-
misssrs in April 1930 reorganized HGA into six independent institutes:
geological exploration. mining. petroleum. nonferrous metals. steel.

and pest. This was an objective reflection of the swift growth of our
socialist industry and agriculture and the country's steadily growing
need for engineering and scientific specialists. Vithin the group of
six institutes. the Moscow Geological Exploration Institute. which
added the geological division from Moscow State University. has since
that time performed the honorable and important role of academic.
scientific. and methodological center of geological exploration educa-
tion in the country and the only specialized higher educational insti-
tution that trains engineers with unique specialisations and speciali-
zations in the fields of geology. techniques of exploration and work-
ing nonferreus ores. rare and radioactive metals. radio hydrogeolegy.
engineering geology. nuclear geophysics. economics of mineral raw ma-
terials. and geotechnolegy.

Taking over from "CA. the collective of NOR! set out with enormous
energy and enthusiasm to fulfill the hetherland's new assignments for
training nining engineering geologists and took an active part in
prospecting for and-exploration of mineral raw materials for indus-
trial needs. A major event for the institute took place in 1932 when
it was given the famous name of Serge 0rdzhenikidze. who all his life
set a brilliant example of selfless service to the working people and
tireless struggle for the happiness and freedom of the Soviet Union
and building a communist society in our country. The collective of
HGRl remembers today and will always remember this date and the nane
Serge. which is associated with those years of extremely difficult
struggle and joyous triuaph for our people. as a small. priceless frag-
ment of these heroic years. as a glorious revolutionary aeaorial and
mandate to justify the party's trust.

During the 10 years of 1930-1950 the four departments of HGRI. geology.
exploration. hydrogeology. and geophysics. trained 1.261 geological
exploration specialists and 18 candidates of geologicalemineralogicsl

In November of the war year of 1961 the institute was evacuated to
the city of Semipalatinsk. where it continued to perform its primary
mission of training engineering specialists. Teachers and students
worked with tripled energy to do everything they could to provide
necessary metal for the front. In the very first days of the Great
Patriotic Var a significant number of the students and teachers left
for the front and showed heroism and courage in the defense of our

constant readiness to defend our beloved Motherland as skillfully and
courageously as our comrades did in the 1950's.

After our great victory over fascism the institute entered a time of
great expansion and improvement in forms and methods of training spe-
cialists. strengthening scientific ties with institutes of the Academy
of Sciences USSR and production organisations, and development of ex-
tensive socially useful work in the city of Moscow. In 1967 a new
specialisation. "Equipment and Technology of Geological Exploration,"
was born at the institute and later spread to other higher educational
institutions in the country thanks to the fruitful activities of
honoroed scientists of the RSFSR M. I. Kulichikhin. V. M. Kreyter. and
S. A. Volkov and honored geologist of the RSFSR B. I. Voxdvizhenskiy.
The specialization of engineering geophysicist for nuclear radiometric

methods of exploration and engineer-geologist for radioactive metals
was begun.

By 1963 MGRI had provided 6.059 mining engineer-geologists for the
national economy and they had done an outstanding job in performing the

very important assignments of expanding the country's mineral raw ma-
terial base.

In the fall of 1963 the mining geology school of the Moscow Institute

of Nonferrous Metals and Gold imeni M. I. Kalinin (MITsMiZ) was merged
with the Moscow Geological Exploration Institute. Like MGR! this
institute had its origins in MGA and it trained mining engineers in
mining geology and the exploration and working of deposits of non-
ferrous ores and rare and radioactive metals. The formation and de-
velopment of this school is linked to the famous names of academicians

and s. M. Shorokhov. Between I930 and I963 MITsMiz trained 2.603 mining
engineers in this specialisation.

The joining of the two schools (M63! and MITsMiZ) made it possible to
significantly step up the training of specialists in the fields of
exploration of deposits of rare and radioactive setels. nuclear radio-
metric techniques in geology. and exploitation of radioactive raw
material. fields in which there was a critical shortage of specialists,
and also to substantially change the system of training for all spe-
cialists toward a comprehensive approach to evaluating the use of raw
material resources.

By its 50th anniversary the collective of the institute had made note-
worthy achievements (see this journal.No 6 for 1969) and contributed
significantly to the training of engineering and scientific-pedagogical
cadres and to the development of scientific research. For this an
"knee of the Presidium of the 083R Supreme Soviet on 12 Hay 1969
awarded the Order of the Labor Red Banner to the institute. This high
honor was received with enormous enthusiasm end celled forth a new
surge of creative energy and striving to achieve sore and sake a
further contribution to the struggle of the Soviet people to build
con-unis- in our country.

All the activity of the institute collective in the last decade (1968-
1970) has been influenced by the unprecedented scale of socialist
building with its grandiose quantitative and qualitative challenges.
the country's steadily growing need for mineral raw saterials. and the
creative plans of the Columnist Party of the Soviet Union for the
Ninth and Tenth five-year plans. in its glorious 60 years MGR! has
trained 16.100 specialists (5.100 of them in the last decade) with

top qualifications in the fields of geological surveying and prospect-
ing for sinerel products. mining geology and exploitation of deposits
of nonferrous ores and rare and radioactive metals. hydrogeology and
engineering geology. geophysical lethods of prospecting and explore-
tion. exploration equip-ant. exploitation of deposits of ores of rare
and radioactive metals. and the econosics of geological exploration
and mining work. In these sees years the institute has trained about
1.000 engineer-geologists for $6 socialist and developing countries.

The most significant and satisfying of all the achievements in which

the institute takes justified pride today is the success of NOR!
graduates. who are working in virtually all sectors of our country's
econouy. Our graduates P. Ya. Antropov. Ye. A. Kozlovskiy. A. Ye.

is detersined by the sectorial sinistries and departments (this need
includes the enterprises of Moscow city and Moscow Oblsst). Beginning
in the third or fourth year of study specialists (up to 100 persons)
are trained on the basis of individual curricula in geotechnology.

seats at the institute have been aodernized. Nev laboratories for
aerial techniques in geology. electron aicroacopy. the geology and
geocheaistry of rare and radioactive eleaents. technological ore

computers and a classroom with small keyboard computers. Intensive
preparations are underway to incorporate modern new computers in the
new subdepartment of "Engineering Cybernetics." The audiovisual
rooms of the subdepartments of foreign languages and Russian and the
teaching methods office on techniques of exploration of mineral de-
posit (a prise-winner at the Exhibition of the Achievements of the
National Economy). mechanics. economics. and diploma projects are
having a significant. positive effect in developing and improving con-
ditions for independent work by students. Since 1976 Zl subdepart-
mental offices at the Rudoznattsy Student House have begun educa-
tional consultation work.

The ore-mineralogy and geology-paleontology museums of the institute
with their rich. unique collections have begun to be used much more
in student academic and scientific work and also to meet the steadily
growing needs of numerous scientific organizations. tekhnikums. and
Moscow schools with respect to excursions. consultations, and making
duplicate collections.

A technical teaching aids office was opened recently and has had a pos-
itive effect by supplying subdepartments with film and slide projectors.
tape recorders. amplifiers. and agonek monitoring units. The subde-
partment of geodesy and mine surveying (Professor V. I. Borshch-
Kompeniyets) has a new 30-seat classroom equipped with a Ritm-Z unit.
The card file at the technical aids office contains 231 educational
films. 820 film strips. and more than 15.000 slides. At the present
time up to 20 percent of all types of classes use technical aids. As
an experiment. the subdepsrtment of chemistry is training students
according to a programmed system.

In 1973-76 a good deal of methodological and organizational work was
done on the presentation of new courses such as introduction to the
specialization. environmental protection. Soviet law. computer tech-
nology in engineering and economic calculations. and the cycle of
organizational and economic disciplines. Since 1976 academic research
projects have been introduced in all the curricula of upper division
students. The planning and monitoring of independent work by students
have improved significantly thanks to monthly testing in all disci-
plines which was instituted in 1972.

An exceptionally important place in the many different types of extra-
curricular work with students belongs to writing research papers under
the direction of the social science subdepartments. In recent years
100 percent of the students have participated in writing research
papers on sociopolitical themes. with 65 percent of them given at
seminars and theoretical conferences or used in speeches to the young
people of Moscow enterprises and in talks with workers at on-the-job
training sites. The sociopolitical section has become a necessary

part of practical training. These forms of independent work by students.
as well as their active participation in the sections of the department
of public occupations, promote the sociopolitical development of young
specialists and help them prepare to take the state examination in

scientific communism that was introggced in 1976.

academic-scientific facilities and practical training techniques have
continued to be isproved at the ngorsk and Crimean training sites on
the basis of using the latest equipment and computers. aggregating the
problems being solved. and introducing practice research elements in
them. Under conditions close to real production students master the
practical skills of work with various modern drilling tools and mining
machines. the use of geophysical equipment and nuclear radiometric
instruments. and the procedures of hydrogeological and engineering geo-
logical prospecting and blasting work. Significantly more students do
their production and pre-diploma practice training in expeditions and
parties of the scientific research sector and conduct studies of
very timely national economic problems. The formation of practice
scientific detachments of up to 200 students for the period of winter
vacation. organized by the scientific research sector and department

of physical training. proved exceptionally effective. ’

The professors and teachers at MGR! have published more than 723 text-

The institute operates a department for raising the qualifications of
executives of the USSR Ministry of Geology with an annual student body
of 700. Teachers from many higher educational institutions in the USSR
and socialist countries and stipend students of the United Nations go
through on-the-job training at the institute. In recent years the in-
stitute has conducted classes in s science-practical school for spe-
cialists from Bulgaria, East Germany. and Czechoslovakia on timely ques-
tions of the geology of rare metal raw materials. The close combination
of academic and scientific work is very important in indoctrination of
the students. The institute has broad possibilities for this thanks to
the vigorous scientific research of the teachers aimed at accelerating
scientific-technical progress in the country's geological exploration
service and in mining.

The Moscow Geological Exploration Institute is continuing the glorious
traditions of the "GA in maintaining close communication with produc-
tion, scientific establishments of the Academy of Sciences USSR. and
sectorial scientific research institutes. More than 100 contracts for
creative cooperation provide mutual enrichment for project partici-
pants and open up new opportunities.

In the last 10 years the volume of scientific research on economic
contracts has increased steadily and is now about 6.3 million rubles
a year with an economic benefit of about five rubles per ruble of ex-
penditures from introduction of completed studies.

The scientists working at the institute are marking its 60th anniver-
sary with a significant contribution to development of the primary
branches of geological science and geological exploration and solving
the problems of comprehensive extraction of ores of nonferroua, rare.
and radioactive metals from the earth's interior. rational use of all
mineral raw material resources, and preservation of the natural envi-
ronment. matters of deep concern to world society today. And in this
important state work MGR! is carefully maintaining. as a special asset,
the scientific schools of its outstanding predecessorsand developing
them through the efforts of young and talented students who thoroughly
understand the rules of the creative processes of our mighty socialist
society.

The vast project directed by Professor A. Ye. Hikhaylov to compile a
geological map of the useful minerals of Kounradskiy Rayon in Central
Kazakhstan for an area of 12,000 square kilometers has identified the
prlncipal industrial types of ore. devised a metallogenic zoning sys-
tem. and discovered seven sectors that show promise with respect to
are. This same collective's study of the Upper Jurassic reef complexes
of the Southwestern Gissar enabled them to identify zones where reef-
type natural gas traps have developed. thereby increasing reserves of
this valuable raw material by 20 billion cubic meters and providing an
economic impact of 3.6 million rubles for the Urtabulak deposit alone.

The institute'u increasingly active participation in development of de-
posits in ﬂeBaikal-Amur Mainline zone enabled the scientists led by

K. H. Hel'nikova to identify for the first time mineral groups of
several metals in the Udokan are field region on the basis of geologi-
cal maps. The quantitative-qualitative criteria of the degree of ex-
ploration of deposits developadunder the scientific direction of A. B.
Kazhdan made it possible to greatly improve the reliability of esti-
mates of explored reserves and to perform economic evolutions of geo-
logical exploration work.

"palarstanide." while a Diploma of the All-Union Mineralogical Society
was received for the mineral ”taymyrite."

Scientists from the institute under the scientific direction of P. P.
Kllmentov were able to help solve the problem of water supply to the
Vorkuta industrial region by tapping underground waters. Pundamen-
tally new techniques of probabilistic statistical processing of hydro-
chemical data were developed and automated systems created to process
hydrogeologizsl information and algorithms for manipulating files within
the system (professors G. Ts. Tumarkin and l. K. Gavich). The first
comprehensive methodology for choosing the optiml version of opera-
tion of vertical drainage based on the use of analog and digital com-
puters was devised for the conditions of the submontane plain of the
Kabardino-lalksr ASSR (in connection with an expansion of the irri-
gation systems there).

The scientific school of geophysicists at the institute. of which P. H.
Kamenetskiy is scientific director, has developed a new method of
aerial electrical reconnaissance for mineral deposits and introduced
in practical geological exploration work a multichannel geophysical
instrument with a digital data recording system placed in a “-26
hel icrpter. A new method of statistical analysis of the parameters
of seismic profiling by the reflected wave technique (scientific di-

ing are going forward on a broad scale. In just the five years 1972-
1977 the economic benefit from introducing methods of underground leach-
ing of metal from ores at research sites of this subdepartment was 18.2
million rubles.

The 10-year activities of the collective of scientists directed by A. Ye.
Smoldyrev to devise a set of methods and equipment for geological study
of the upper parts of the cross-section in the shelf areas of non-
Arctic seas proved very productive. Working in cooperation with the
Pacific Ocean Marine Geological Exploration Expedition andthe Primorskiy
T60 [expansion unknown]. they first wrote and adopted a prognosis map
with a set of auxiliary maps. All geological methods research work and
sampling of bottom deposits was completed with development and publica-
tion of methodological recommendations and construction of mock-ups

and models of devices and equipment to be turned over to production or-
ganizations.

The primary efforts of the economic scientists under the direction of
corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences USSR N. l. Agoshkev
were devoted to the development and introduction of the scientific
foundations of evaluating the economic efficiency of geological explor-
ntion and mining work into practice at geological exploration and min-
ing enterprises. As part of the general program for rational use of
the earth's interior and environmental protection the research of MGR!
economic scientists was a significant contribution to the economic
science and practice of developing our country's mineral raw material
base.

The higher scientific-technical level and quality of scientific research
are characterized by the increase in the number of scientific research
projects done at the level of inventions and by the submission of up

to 6.27 invention applications per 100.000 rubles worth of defensible
subjects and receiving up to 2.32 positive decisions on them. In

just the last 10 years associates of the institute have received 315
author's certificates for inventions. diplomas for discoveries.

patents. and medals of the Exhibition of the Achievements of the
National Economy. Some of the inventionshove been patented in the
United States. Canada. France. Sweden. Syria. lndia. and Pakistan.

Students of the institute are consistent and active participants (90
percent) in scientific research. They conduct their research as mem-
bers of expeditions. scientific study groups in the subdepartments.
and in the student research laboratory. They carry on practice re-
search in the scientific laboratories of both their own and the sec-
torial institutes of the city of Moscow. There were numerous students
among the 130 active inventors at the institute in 1978. Students
also write articles in the scientific journals. Each year young re-
searchers win medals of the Exhibition of the Achievements of the
National Economy. diplomas. and certificates in science competitions.

sciences. history of the Komsomol. and international youth movement. and
the best projects receive honorary awards. The Moscow city student
Olympics in mathematics. civics. chemistry. foreign languages. and eco-
nemdcs are becoming increasingly popular among students. Considerable
importance is attached to all these and other forms of developing the
creative activism of students at MCRI. In recent years students

ham begun to attend a class in patent affairs and to enjoy the services
of the institute's patent division and published methodological guides
on patents and licenses.

The steadily growing scientific potential and reputation of MGR! enable
it to perform increasingly important and respectworthy assignments from
the ministry. It is 10 years already that the Read Council on Geology
and Exploration of Mineral Products of the RSPSR Ministry of higher and
Specialized Education (chairman D. P. Lobanov. learned secretary docent
I. N. Kadyrov). which takes in 55 higher educational institutions in

the Russian Pederation. has been based at MGRI. The council has 29

The council is making its contribution to solving the problem of improv-
ing teaching methods work. coordinating scientific research projects for
all specializations in geological science. and planning the publication
of literature within the educational institutions.

Since 1974 the Head Council on Political Economy of the RSPSR Ministry
of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education has been based at MGR!
(Council chairman professor N. D. Kolesov. deputy chairman professor

G. S. Shcherbakov. learned secretary docent V. P. Khnlturina). The
council coordinates the research of political economists at higher edu-
cational institutions of the RSFSR in the areas of problems of the eco-
nomics of a developed socialist society. evolving more efficient forms
and methods of developing the productive forces of Siberia and the Par
East. the socialist way of life. joining the scientific-technical revo-
lution with the advantages of socialism as a key path of accelerated
social development on the way to communism. the economic mechanism of

a socialist society. the development of socialist integration. and new
phenomena in present-day capitalism.

In I975 MGR! became the base of activities for the RSFSR Ministry of
Migher and Secondary Specialized Education's problem council "Party

Developed Socialisef'(chairman of the Council - honored scientist of
the RSFSR professor a. M. Morozov. deputy chairman professor S. P.
Lyushin. and learned secretary decent I. L. Reshin). The council influ-
ences 81 subdepartments of CPSU history and more than 250 researchers

at higher educational institutions in the Russian Federation and has a
beneficial effect on all facets of improving teaching eethods and socio-
political life in the collectives of the schools.

By decision of the Higher Degree Commission of the USSR Council of
Ministers. MGR! has l2 specialized councils for the defense of candidate
(5) and doctoral (7) dissertations in the fields of the geological-
nineralogicai, technical. physico-mathematical. and economic sciences.

In [977 the lnterschool Foreign Language Laboratory was transferred by
order of the RSFSR Ministry of higher and Secondary Specialized Educa-
tion from the Moscow Automatic Machine Institute to Maui where scien-
tific direction is exercised by the head of the subdepartment. docent
P. V. Maumenkov. The primary assignment of this laboratory is to de-
Veiop and introduce contemporary methods of teaching students foreign
languages at non-language higher educational institutions of the Rus-
sian Federation. The vigorous work of these councils and the foreign
language laboratory and creative use of the results of their activities
offer the collective of the institute enormous opportunities to improve
the entire educational and indoctrinational process.

Carrying out the hehests of Vladimir ll'ich Lenin on the international
obligations of the world's first Land of Soviets the collective of MGR!
has broadened and deepened educational-scientific and cultural ties
with foreign higher educational institutions.

Our relations with the Sofia Mining Geological Institute in Bulgaria.
the Freiberg Mining Academy in East Germany. and the Krakow Mining and
Metallurgical Academy in Poland are developing and growing stronger on
the basis of long-term treaties of friendship and cooperation. In just
the last 10 years more than $00 students from the Soviet Union and from
these partner countries under the direction of almost 100 teachers have
gone through familiarization production training at installations in the
Soviet Union. Bulgaria. East Germany. and Poland. The curricula and
ayllabi for related specialisations at our higher educational institu-
tions have been made much more similar and the exchange of students for
full courses of study and teachers to give lectures. perform scientific
research work. and take part in scientific conferences has increased.

Mew forms of scientific ties have developed and reached a qualitatively
higher level. Scientific research is now done by entire collectives of
subdepartments for scientific problems of great economic importance to
both countries. for example, comparative study of the geological struc-
ture of the western part of the Crimean Peninsula and the eastern part
of Northern Bulgaria (also encompassing the water of the Black Sea be-
tween them) made it possible for the first time to compile 36 paleo-
facics maps on a scale of l:l.000,000 for all the primary subdivisions
of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The first geological overview of the pre-

Mssoeoic erosion section was producig for the black Sea area and

ndlnruni regions. For the first time the geological structure and tec-
tonics of territories covered by waterwmra depicted on tectonic and neo-
tectonic maps. This work by Soviet (M. V. Muratov and A. Ye. Mikhaylov)
and bulgarhn (T. B. Dobrev. S. !. Zafirov. and s. I. Strsshchimirov)
scientists was highly praised at the USSR Ministry of Geology and the
bulgarian Ministry of Mineral Resources. Four other scientific research
projects by collectives of scientists from MGR! and VMG! [expansion un-

known] have been performed and are continuing on the same organizational
and methodological plane.

Three scientific problems are being developed jointly with scientists
from the Preiberg Mining Academy. These problems encompass the ques-
tions of devising new technology for working deposits with complex min-
ing geological conditions; analyzing underground cavities by the emana-
tion method; improving geophysical methods of prospecting for and ex-
ploring mineral products.

Joint work with scientists from the Krakow Mining and Metallurgical
Academy centers on three important problems: geochemistry of the na-
tural gases of the coal deposits of the Donets (USSR) and Upper
Silesian (Poland) basins: improving the processes of dust suppression
during mining work; devising flow technology for open pits with con-
tlnuous-action equipment.

The prolonged scientific cooperation between professors K. Hoinar of
the Krakow Academy and V. S. Vladislavlev of MGR! enabled them to
write. and publish in Polish. the basic textbook "Drilling." A mono-
graph entitled "Engineering Geological Studies for Mydroengineering
unstruction" by a collective of authors including professor I. S.
Komarov (MGRI). engineer A. A. Molokov (USSR All-Union Planning. Sur-
veying, and Research institute iaeni S. Ya. Zhuk). professor P.
Reuter (Freiberg Mining Academy). and professor Ja. Dzewanski

(Krakow Academy) is being prepared for publication in 1980.

The Moscow Geological Exploration Institute has maintained close rela-
tions with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam since 1955. During this
time 173 young Vietnamese men and women have received MGR! diplomas

of higher geological exploration education; 26 of them have defended
candidate's dissertations and one defended a doctoral dissertation.

The dissertation subjects were timely problems of development of mineral
raw materials, land reclamation. water supply. and hydroconstruction in
Vietnam. Scientists from MGR! such as P. P. Klimentov. G. !. Nemkov.
!. K. Gavich. !. s. Komarov. V. I. Drozdov. and L. A. Yarg. among
others. provide regular scientific methods help to specialists from
this country.

On 5 May 1978 Comrade Nguyen Muy Khieu. Extraordinary and Official Am-
bassador, awarded the Order of Friendship of the Soc1.11§t Republic
of Vietnam to MGR! for help given to the Government of Vietnam in
training scientific and technical specialists.

MGRI gives many types of sponsorship help to the Conakry Polytechnic
Institute of the Guinea People‘s Revolutionary Republic. Teachers from
the Moscow Geological Exploration Institute imeni S. 0rdzhonikidze have
done the basic methodological-organizntional and educational work in

the mining geology department of this institute (in the city of Bake)
steadily for lb years now.

For 10 years we have cooperated with the Osman University in the city of
Hyderabad. India within the framework of the long-term agreement between
the USSR Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized education and the
University Commission of the Ministry of Education of India. In this
relatively short time a geophysical department and the center of explor-
ation geophysics in India have been set up at Osman University with the
active participation of our professors (M. I. Plyusnin. A. G. Tsrkhov.
F. H. Kamenetskiy. I. I. Gurvich. and docents V. M. Bondarenho. G. A.
Solov'yev. Ye. I. Savenko. F. T. Iorisovich. 6. N. Bagsnih. and others).
The laboratory of this unique educational and science center has up-to-
date geophysical apparatus and equipment delivered by the USSR with our
assistance. The department has a full complement of national teachers
who went through on-the-job training at HGRI. Indian (professors
lhimasamkaram. Shashachari. and Matur) and Soviet (professors I. I.
Gurvich and H. I. Plyuanin and docents G. A. Solov'yev and Ye. I.
Savenho) together have published the textbooks "introduction to Field
Theory." "Radiometry." "Seismic Exploration." and "Geophysical Hell
Testing" and more than 15 teaching aids in English. About 110 Indian
citizens who went through courses of study with curricula resembling
ours have successfully completed studies and received diplomas as
engineer-geophysicists. Twelve candidate's dissertations have been
prepared in the department and Viji Ragava defended a candidate's
dissertation at our institute. In the coming years a large program of
cooperation between MGR! and the geophysical department of Osman
University is planned.

About 90 foreign teachers and scitntific associates have gone through
on-the-job training in the subdepartments of HGRI. More than 70 of
the most highly trained pedagogs at MGR! have been sent for different
periods of time to give lectures at higher educational institutions in
Cuba. Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavia. Afghanistan.Laos. Vietnam, Algeria.
Syria. Angola. Congo. India. Guinea. and the United States.

The scientists from HGRI have taken an active part in the work of in-
ternational scientific conferences and geological and mining congresses
and symposia held in hungsry. Bulgaria. East Germany. italy. England.
the United States. Canada. Vest Germany. Brazil. and other countries.
The institute has sent its leading specialists to provide technical

aid at mining and geological installations in Mongolia. Bulgaria. East
Germany. Czechoslovakia. Peru. Iran. Madagascar. India. and Syria.

The stream of graduate students coming to our institute increases year
after year. as does the number of countries from which they come. At
the present time the institute has 33 foreign graduate students from

16 countries (Bulgaria. East Germany. Czechoslovakia. Mongolia. Vietnam.

tute will strengthen the international bonds of friendship in the field
of higher education. reneabering the words spoken by Conrade L. I.
brezhnev at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Rouse-oi:
"Soviet people. raised in the fraternal faaily of peoples and indoctri-
nated in the ideas of Haraisa-Leninisa. are internationalist by their
very nature."

The collective of the institute is persistently working to expend its
asterial-technical base, building a new HGRI coaplex in Cher-ushkinskiy
Rayon in Moscow and also building new facilities at the Zagorsk and Cri-
Iesn training sites. In the lest 10 years a student dorsitory with
280 places. a new boiler room. a warehouse. metal sheds for all train-
ing and scientific vehicles. and subdepartaental scientific research
stands have been built at the Zagorsh training center. A stadium has
been constructed and vehicle roads fixed up. This base has become a
lively place to conduct practical science projects and competition dur-
ing the sue-er. hold sports-health csaps for college and secondary
students during the winter vacation. and organize study for Koasoaol
and trade union activists. Each August a ceremonial student initia-
tion and celebration of the beginning of the school year is held there.

Construction on the teaching and laboratory wing and dining hall at the
Crineen training center near the city of Bahhchisaray is nearing
coapletion. The boiler room and various administrative buildings have
already been built. The next thing will be construction of a well-
appointed student doraitory.

The collective has done a great deal of hard work on construction of
the new HCRI couples in Moscow. Its total estiaated cost is about
14.0 million rubles. In 1976 the Rudoznattsy Student house with

1.391 places was put into use. and in 1977 the Rodonit dining hall.
seating 450. was opened. At the present tiae construction and instal-
lation on the teaching and laboratory wing with a total area of 3b,000
square aeters is at its peak and a great deal of preparation is under-
way to supply equipaent for the new classrooms, laboratories, and of-
fices in the building.

In recent years the teaching and total area of the old buildings has
been increased slightly through redesigning. construction of storage
space and a room for copying equipment. and puttingthe two-story wing
No b in the yard of the institute into use. Nonetheless. the insti-
tute is presently forced to lease about 10,000 square meters of space
in different parts of the city for its scientific work. and. of course,
this sakes the work of our associates more difficult.

when construction of the new complex is completed early in the 11th
Five-Year Plan. our collective will be closer than ever to aeeting
the exceptionally great challenge of turning the Hocow Geological Ex-
ploration Institute into a model higher educational institution in
our beautiful capital. the hero-city of Hoacow. He will struggle for

HISTORY OF THE GEOPHYSICS DEPARTMENT AT HCRI

Moscow IZVESTIYA VYSSRIXR UCREBNYKH ZAVEDENIY: CEOLOGIYA I RAZVBDKA
in Russian No 3. 1979 pp 92-98

[Article by D. S. Dayev and L. L. Lyakhov: "The Geophysics Department
of the Moscow Geological Exploration Institute”!

[Text] The history of the geophysical department at MGR! [Moscow Geo-
logical Exploration Institute] is closely linked to the foraation and
developsent of the geophysics specialisation in Soviet higher educa-
tion. This specialization first appeared in 1928 in the physico-
sathesatical depart-en: of Moscow State University. then in 1930 was
transferred to the newly for-ed Moscow Geological Exploration Insti-
tute. where it finally took shape as an applied field of geological
exploration.

The geophysics department at HGRI consisted of four special subdepart-
vents corresponding to the basic branches of exploration geophysics:
electrosetry and magnetonetry (headed by professor A. I. Zaborovskiy);
gravisetry (headed by professor L. V. Sorokin); seissoletry (first
headed by professor V. P. bonchkovskiy and later by acadesician c. A.
Ganburtsev); radionetry (headed by professor V. I. Baranov); and the
three general subdepartnents of nothesatics, mechanics. and electrical
engineering.

The first graduation of specialists in geophysical exploration took
place in 1931. The first curricula envisioned training specialists

in particular techniques of exploration geophysics. but in 1932 the
institute began training specialists in the broad field of exploration
geophysics. In the same year of 1932 the four special subdepartlents
were joined in the subdepartuent of general geophysical methods.
headed by professor A. l. Zabrovskiy.

Professor A. l. Zabrovskiy headed the geophysics departuent fros its
formation until 1956; from l9Sb until 1955 the head of the depart-
sent was professor A. c. Tarkov. followed by docent L. L Lyahhov in
1958-61. docent D. P. Zinin in 1961-70. doceot L. L. Lyakhov again in
1970-1975. and from 1975 until the present by professor D. S. Dayev.

The curriculum and syllabi of courses. laboratory classes. and practical
training have changed somewhat as the particular methods of exploration
geophysics developed and special attention was given by industry to
prospecting for and exploration of particular types of mineral products.
For example. in connection with the increase in prospecting for and ex-
ploration of deposits of radioactive raw material and the rapid develop-
ment of radioactive techniques in 19b9-l950. the special field of geo-
physical sethods of prospecting for and exploring deposits of radio-
active elements was introduced and the subdepartaent of radiometric and
nuclear physical methods was formed. This subdepartment was headed by
professor V. I. laranov until 1958. by docent A. S. Serdyukov in 1958-
1968. and by professor A. G. Tsrkhov from 1970 until 1978.

In the 1960's three specializations were created within the primary geo-
physical specialisation: ore. structural. and drilling geophysics. At
the same time broadly educated engineer-geophysicists continued to be
trained. but they made a deeper study of the investigative methods of
one of these fields of exploration geophysics.

In 1951-l956 the department'was assigned to train geologists in the
specialization "The Geology and Exploration of Deposits of Radioactive
Elements." At this time the department Has the largest at “OR! in num-
ber of students and organizing the learning process made great desanda
on the dean and major aubdepartments.

The graduating subdepartsent for exploration geophysicists in general
geophysical methods was the aubdspartment of geophysical aathods of
exploration. later tens-ed the subdepertmsnt of exploration geophysics
and then the subdepartment of general geophysical methods of explora-
tion. Until 1956 the subdepertment was headed by professor A. 1.
Zaborovskiy. then from 1956 until 1965 by professor L. H. Al'pin. and
in [965-1978 by professor H. I. Plyusnin. In 1978 the subdepartment
was divided into two: the subdepartment of seismic and well methods
of exploration (headed by professor H. I. Plyusnin) and the aubdapert-
ment of electrical. gravitational. and magnetic methods of exploration
(headed by professor D. s. Dsyev).

The aubdepartment of physics. which is a part of the geophysics depart-
ment. has been headed in different years by V. L. Levshin. acadeeician
P. P. Lazarev. professor A. A. Petrovskiy (a student and associate of
A. S. Popov). professor l. u. Cohhberg, academician of the Acadesy of
Sciences of the Belorussian SSR N. s. Akulov. and professor Ya. V.
Krnvtsov. Since 1965 professor V. c. Selenov has been its head. Pro-
fessor V. T. Ter-Oganesov was head of the aubdepartment of mathematics

for many years: from 1962 until the present professor G. Ta. Tumarkin
has been the head there.

The figures on training of exploration geophysicists in the department
are interesting. Between 1930 and 1950 125 engineers were graduated;

in 1941-1950 there were 201 graduates; in 1951-1960 the figure was

703: from 1961 to 1978 1.506 engineers have been graduated. In the
prewar years more than 70 percent of the young specialists were assigned

56

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

to the geophysical service of the petroleum industry and only six per-
cent sent to organizations working at are deposits. The department is
proud that the petroleum geophysics service that took shape as early
as the years of the first five-year plane was formed primarily through
the efforts of MGRI graduates (P. A. Pospelov. V. A. Khar'kevich. M. K.
Polshkov. s. G. Komarov. N. A. Per'kov. A. N. Pedorenko. and others)
and scientists of the department (A. l. Zahorovskiy. G. A. Gaehurtsev.
L. M. Al'pin. L. V. Sorokin. and L. A. Ryahinkin).

In the postwar years most of our graduates have been sent to organi-
zations of the USSR Ministry of Geology for work in ore geophysics.

A significant number of graduates of the department are also assigned
to organizations of other departments such as USSR Gosstroy. RSFSR
Gosstroy. the Ministry of Transport Construction. the Ministry of Land
Reclamation and Hater Resources. the Ministry of Power and Electrifi-
cation. end others.

At the present time alumni of the department are working within the
systems of the ministries of geology. the petroleum industry. the coal
industry. and ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy. in the geological
territorial administrations. trusts. offices. expeditions. and scien-
tific institutes of these ministries. and at institutes of the Academy
of Sciences USSR. They are teaching at many higher educational insti-
tutions such as Moscow and Saratov universities. the Moscow Institute
of the Petrochemical and Gas Industry imeni academician I. M. Gubkin.
the Kazakh Polytechnic Institute. the Groznyy and Baku petroleum insti-
tutes. and others. Department ale-nus N. A. Sevost'yanov heads the
geophysical service in the petroleum industry. and graduates of the
department have headed or today head the leading scientific institutes
in the country for the development of geophysical science: All-Union
Scientific Research Institute of Geophysical Exploration Methods and
All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Nuclear Geophysics and Geo-
chemistry (professors M. K. Polshkov and Ye. V. Karus) and the All-
Union Scientific Research Institute of Mineral Raw Materials (professor
A. N. Yeremeyev). They are managing the development of geophysical
methods of well testing and logging service in the petroleum industry
(N. N. Soranov and A. S. Kashik) and are leading specialists of the
geophysics service of the USSR Ministry of Geology (V. I. Pedyuk. A. S.
Baahenov. and others) and the RSPSR Ministry of Geology.

The geophysics groups at various scientific institutes. for example.
the Central Scientific Research Institute for Exploration of Non-
ferrous. Rare. and Noble Metals. the All-Union Scientific Research
Institute of Mineral Raw Materials. the All-Union Scientific Insti-
tute of Marine Geology. the Institute of Earth Physics. and the Insti-
tute or Oceanology of the Academy of Sciences USSR. are largely
staffed with graduates of the department. Many department graduates
work in the field of prospecting for. exploration, and exploitation of
deposits of rare and radioactive elements.

Our graduates have made a large contribution to the development and
refinement of the theory and practice of geophysical methods. Their

achievements and discoveries have been highly praised by the Party and
Government: the work of N. P. Chunarav and B. V. Polovinkin received
Lenin Prizes and 26 people have won the State Prise. among them

and A. N. Pederenko. c. A. Selyatitshiy was awarded the title Nero of
Socialist Labor. Many geophysicists have been granted orders and medals
for discovering deposits and for scientific and production achievements
(A. N. Yeremeyev. N. I. Kiselev. L. Ch. Pukhal'skiy. L. N. Al'pin. I. I.
Gurvich, V. P. Nomokonov. and others). More than 60 alumni of the de-
partment have defended doctoral dissertations and about 200 have re-
ceived candidate of sciences degrees.

The development of the specialization demanded constant improvement and
updating of the courses offered and development of new courses. All
the special courses were revised with application to the new speciali-
zations. New courses entitled "Combining Geophysical Techniques“ (pro-
fessors A. G. Tarkhov and H. l. Plyusnin and docents A. I. Dyukov and
V. V. arodovoy). "Recording and Processing Geophysical Information“
(docents A. A. Nikitin and c. N. Boganik). and "Theoretical Foundations
of Exploration Geophysics” (professors A. H. Al'pin and D. S. Dayev)
appeared. The course "Exploration Geophysics" was fundamentally re-
vised fer the geological and mining specializations (professor Yu. V.
Yakubovskiy and docents L. L. Lyakhov. N. D. Novalonko. I. N. styrov.
and V. N. londerenko) and a new course "Geological Interpretation of
Geophysical Data" was instituted.

The subdepartment of radiometric and nuclear physical methods developed
courses in radiometry. mine radiometry, nuclear geophysics. and dosim-
etry (professor V. I. Barenov and docenta A. S. Serdyukova. L. V.
Gorbushina, D. F. Zimin. V. G. Tenyayev. and Ya. I. Savenko) both for
the geophysics specialization and for geological specializations. In
shaping the specialization. the subdepartment did a great deal of
scientific methods work to set up a modern laboratory course in radio-
metric nnd nuclear geophysical methods. develop teaching aids, organize
production practice. and establish a radiometric training center.

Since 1970 the aubdepartment has developed and introduced courses in
the application of mathematical statistical methods of processing geo-
physical observetions (A. c. Tarkhov. A. A. Nikitin. and G. V. Demure).

The subdepartment of mathematics has done a great deal to insure a

high level of mathematical training for students in all specializations.
not just geophysics students. At the present time more than 80 per-
cent of the teachers in the aubdepartment have basic university educa-
tion and more than 70 percent have academic degrees. In the 1960's

the collective of the subdepartment modernized the general course in
higher mathematics and introduced new courses in “Programming" and
"Computer Technology in Engineering-Economic Calculations." They intro-
duced machine mathematical methods for course and diploma projects

based on the computer laboratory setip in 1969 with rooms for electronic
and keyboard machines. Nork is underway to design and introduce plans

for continuous mathematical training of students in all specialisations.
By persistent methods work the collective of the subdepartment was able
to bring the level of teaching of mathematics close to the requirements
of the specialized and major disciplines and give students practical
skills in appropriate mathematical calculations.

The physics subdepnrtment has always done a great deal of methods work
to revise the content of lecture courses and laboratory cycles with
reference to the requirements and specific features of particular spe-
cialisations. Thus. professor A. A. Petrovskiy introduced the "Spe-
cial Course in Electricity for Exploration Geophysicists"; questions
or solid state physics are now separated out in an independent section
and the laws of potential fields. oscillations and wave processes of
mechanics, electromagnetism. and optics are studied in parallel.

Teachers of the department have written many textbooks and teaching
aids. In the prewar years they wrote the world's first textbooks for
geophysics students: 6. A. Gamburtsev's "Seismic Exploration." A. I.
Zaborovakiy's "Electrical Exploration," "Terrestrial Magmatism," and
"Special Functions." and L. V. Sorokin's "Gravimetric Methods of Ex-
ploration." In the postwar years many more works were published. in-
cluding "Radiometry“ by V. I. Baranov, "Field Theory" and "Practical
Projects in Field Theory" by L. H. Al'pin, "Radiometric and Nuclear
Physical Methods of Prospecting" by L. V. Gorbushina. D. P. 21min,

and A. s. Serdyukovl."Seismic Exploration" by I. I. Gurvich. "Elec-
trical Exploration" by Yu. V. Yakubovskiy." and "Electrical Explora-
tion" by Yu. V. Yakubovskiy and L. L. Lyekhov. Some of these books
came out in several editions and were translated into foreign languages.
6. A. Solov'yev published the textbook "Introduction to Field Theory"
in India in the English language. Associates in all the subdepsrt-
ments of the department have written more than 60 teaching aids in par-
ticular areas of the courses offered. for practical classes. laboratory
projects. and practical geophysical training.

Scientific work has always played a large part in the activity of the
department; it is a significant determining factor in the level of
pedagogical activity of the teachers and the quality of graduating
specialists. In the prewar years the primary scientific interests

of the geophysics subdepartments dealt with working out the funda-
mentals of the theory and interpretation of different geophysical
methods: electromagnetic (A. I. Zaborovskiy. L. H. Al'pin, and

V. 0. Uryson). seismic(G.A. Gemburtsev and L. A. Ryabinkin). elec-
trical logging and dipole techniques of electrical exploration

(L. H. Al'pin). radiometry (V. I. Baranov). gravimetry (L. V. Sorokin
and Va. A. Hudretsova). and magnetic exploration (Ye. A. Hudretsova
and A. I. Petrov). At the same time teachers and associates of the
department carried out field projects to develop and introduce new
methods of geophysical testing and participated in prospecting for
and exploring deposits of mineral products in the Rare Lowland. the
Southern and Central Urals. the Alatsu. and the Arctic (A. I.
Zabrovskiy, L. H. Al'pin, Ye. K. Baranov. A. A. Petrovskiy, L. V.
Sorokin. and others).

Rapid growth in scientific work began immediately after the end of

the Great Patriotic Var. which was a result of the abrupt. general en-
largement of geological and geophysical studies in the USSR. The

scope of scientific work has been particularly broad in the last
decade. when the annual volume of scientific research projects for the
special subdepartments has reached 250,000-300,000 rubles. Unlike the
situation in tho prewar years. the geophysics subdepartments have re-
ceived the opportunity to conduct cosprehensive geophysical studies
together with other subdepartmente of the institute and with produc-
tion organisations. Projects of this type were carried out in 19b6-
1949 in the Carpathians. in 1950-1952 in the suburban Moscow basin
(jointly with the Geofiauglerazvedks [Geophysical Coal Exploration
Trustl). in 1952-195b in the Karatau (jointly with the South Kazakhstan
Geological Administration and the Kazakh Geophysical Trust). in 1957-63
in the Transbaikal. in 1970-1971 in North Kazakhstan. and elsewhere.
These projects have provided the basis for the formation of scien-
tific collectives. involving students in scientific research work. and
broadening the training of graduate students. In addition. associ-
ates of the department are conducting major studies in particular
scientific areas: inductive electrical exploration (Yu. V. Vakubovskiy.
F. N. Kemenskiy. l. A. Dobrokhotova. and others). the aerial version of
the crossing processes method (P. N. Kamenetskiy. V. N. Timofeyev. and
P. P. Hakagonov). induction logging (N. I. Plyusin. N. N. Afonina.

I. I. Vil'ge. and others). high-frequency electromagnetic logging

(D. s. Dayev and V. s. Zinchenko). theory of logging (L. N. Al'pin).
underground geophysics (A. G. Tarkhov. V. N. Bondarenko. and others).
seismic exploration (1. 1. Curvich. V. P. Nomokonov. and G. N.

Doganik). radiometry (V. I. Baranov. A. S. Serdyukova. L. V. Gorbushina.
D. P. Zimin. Ye. I. Savenko. and others). the application of mathe-
matical statistical methods and information theory to the processing

of geophysical materials (A. c. Tarkhov. A. A. Nikitin. I. 1. curvich.
G. N. Boganik. O. A. Demidovich. and others). Since 1976 the depart-
sent has been involved in research in the field of marine geophysics.
working on the problem of prospecting for and exploring coastal and
offshore deposits of solid mineral products (L. L. Lyskhov and others).

Among the results of research work have been development of the theory.
apparatus. and methodology of the ungrounded loop method. the cross-
ing processes method. the aerial version of the crossing processes
method. induction dielectric logging. underground gravimetric explor-
ation. the method of underground recording of cosmic radiation. new
techniques of mine seismic exploration. mathematical methods of gas-
physical interpretation. snd apparatus and techniques for continuous
acoustic profiling. Various monographs have been published on the
basis of research results: "Theory of Dipole Probing" (L. H. Al'pin).
"Geophysical Exploration by the Induction Method" and "Foundations of
Geophysical Exploration by the Radioactive Stacks Method" (A. G.
Tsrkhov). "The Induction Method of Electrical Exploration" (Yu. V.
Yakubovskiy). "Induction Logging" (N. I. Plyusnin). "Underground
Geophysics" (A. G. Tarkhov. Ye. A. Nudretsova, V. N. Bondarenko.

N. 0. Lakhtinov. and N. D. Kovalenko). "high-Frequency Electromagnetic

Nikitin), "The Use of Cosmic Rays in Geology" (V. H. Bondarenko).

"The Moon Method of Analyzing the Density of Rocks" (V. H. londarenko
and c. c. Viktorov). Seven doctoral dissertations and 35 candidate
dissertations have been defended. eight medals of the Exhibition of the
Achievements of National Economy awarded. and more than 50 author's
certificates and patents received. The State Committee for Discoveries
and Inventions has registered a scientific discovery in the field of
predicting earthquakes that was coauthored by L. V. Gorbushina. a
decent in the subdepartment of radiometric and nuclear physical methods.
Teachers and associates from the subdepartmenta of physics and mathe-
matics such as G. A. Solov'yev. P. P. Hakagonov. H. N. Smirnova. 0. P.
Lukina. T. A. Trofimova. I. V. Il'in. N. I. Hukhina. H. N. Yudin. and
others have participated in these projects.

Scientific work in the subdapartment of mathematics is pursued in both
the field of pure mathematical research and in applied mathematics.

In the prewar years and first years after the war the volume of scien-
tific work in the subdepartment was limited by the small staff size
(5-7 teachers). Research was carried on in the fields of astronomy
(V. T. Ter-Oganezov), function theory (6. Ta. Tumarkin and K. V.
Yefremov). and number theory (N. I. Fel'dman). Hith the significant
broadening of student mathematical training and introduction of mathe-
matical methods in scientific research at the institute in the 1960's
the number of teachers tripled and. moreover. a computer laboratory
was set up with an appropriate staff of programmers and electronics
experts and graduate student training was begun.

Associates of the subdepartments came to participate actively in the
scientific projects of the geophysical subdepartments, but applied re-
search developed with particular intensity on the application of func-
tion theory. mathematical programming. and numerical methods in de-
velopmental work on mining geological. economic geological. engineering-
hydrogeological. and geophysics topics. Various forms of joint studies
with other subdepartmenta were developed extensively.

Among the scientific achievements of the aubdepartment in the field of
"pure" mathematics we should note the fundamental results obtained by
0. Ta. Tumarkin on the boundary properties of analytic functions and
approximation by polynomials and rational fractions with given poles.
He reported his results at international and All-Union congresses and
conferences and they were translated into English, French, German, and
other languages.

In the field of the application of mathematical methods to theoretical
physics and mechanics, we should note 5, v, Temko's formulation of

a theory of limited physical systems and decent Ya. R. Berman's work
in the field of applying the techniques of the mathematical theory of
currents to problems of the hydraulics of hydroengineering structures.

Foremost among works on the application of mathematical methods in
prospecting for and exploration and exploitation of deposits of mineral

products we should mention research on the use of methods of planning
and experiment to optimize drilling regimes (professors Yo. A.
Koziovakiy and G. Ts. Tumarkin). The studies involving formulation
and solution of the problems of optimizing the extraction of under-
ground water and drainage (professor 0. Ta. Tumarkin. docents A. V.
Hikhaylova. 0. s. Gorbacheva. s. V. Temko. and others). conducted
jointly with the aubdepsrtment of hydrogeolosy. are very important.
Docent P. ?. Hakagonov developed the first system of software for in-
ductive electrical mine exploration. Docent H. A. Ortenberg published
a monograph "Methods of Delineating Metamorphic Complexes." together
with coauthors from the subdepartment of mineralogy.

Successful development of the questions of applying mathematical
methods and computer technology in prospecting for and exploration and
exploitation of deposits of solid mineral products and underground
waters has yielded an economic impact of more than 2 million rubles
from introduction in recent years. Associates of the subdepartment
have received five medals and various participation diplomas from the
Exhibition of the Achievements of the National Economy for work on the
application of mathematical methods and have defended two doctoral and
12 candidate's dissertations.

in the first years of existence of the subdepartment of physics its
scientific work under the direction of Professor y. L. Levshin (who
later won the State Prize) was oriented to the field of polarized
luminescence. establishing links between spectra of absorption and
luminescence. and determining the effect of various physicochemical
factors on luminescence. in 1937-1938 professor A. A. Petrovskiy
conducted studies in the field of radiowave transmission at the sub-
department. After 1965. when V. c. Semenov became head of the sub-
department, the scientific and pedagogical collective has concentrated
its attention on the problem of the physics of rock and phenomena.
which has two special areas: applied thermal studies and the physics
of rocks.

Dork on applied thermal studies began in 1972 (H. O. Lakhtionov. s. H.
Skornyakov. and others) under the general direction of professors

A. c. ankhov and V. G. Semonov. The positive results obtained in
testing thermal exploration at various types of deposits and in dif-
ferent geological-tectonic conditions led to the establishment of a
sectorial laboratory with 14 associates in the auhdepartment. The
laboratory collective is working on development of the physical founde-
tions of thermal exploration and the methodology of observations in a
layer of variable temperatures. They are studying the interrelat-
tionship of the thermal properties of rocks and ores with other petro-
physical parameters. Apparatus for non-contact temperature measurement
is being built (Yu. A. Popov).

In the field of the physics of rocks research is underway on the

physical properties and phenomena of cryogenic rocks (A. D. Frolov and
B. V. Gusev) and study of the spatial zonality of the physical proper-
ties of rocks and ores within hydrothermal deposits (6. A. Solov‘yev).

The results of research on the physics of cryogenic rocks were set
forth by A. D. frolov in the monograph "Electrical and Elastic Proper-
ties of Cryogenic Rocks."

The monograph by professor V. C. Semonov "fluctuations of General At-
mospheric Circulation and Long-Term Forecasts" and the project initi-
ated by docent N. P. Novikov on a laser technique of analyzing the
physical properties of rocks also deserve attention.

Since 1969-1950 associates of the department have participated ac-
tively in assisting the countries of the socialist community and de-
veloping countries in geophysical studies. This has been expressed
above all in training engineer-geophysicists. Students from many
countries have studied in the department: Bulgaria. Hungary. East
Germany. Czechoslovakia. Vietnam. Yugoslavia. Mongolia. North Korea.
the PRC. Cube. Albania. Algeria. Ethiopia. Lebanon. Morocco. Cam roon.
Mali. Nigeria. Somali. the United Arab Emirates. Gabon. and the Yemeni
Arab Republic. During this time 115 engineer-geophysicists have been
trained. fifteen candidates of science have been prepared for scien-
tific institutions and higher educational institutions in Dulgaria.
Vietnam. India. hungary. and other countries through graduate study
and on-the-job training. The collective of the department has been
assigned the duty of giving scientific methods help in establishing
the department of geophysics at Osman University. Professors H. I.
Plyusnin. I. I. Curvich. A. O. Tarkhov. D. s. Dayev. and C. Is.
Tumarkin. doctor of technical sciences P. h. Ksmenetskiy. and docents
A. A. Nikitin. V. H. londarenko. C. A. Solov'yev. Ye. I. Savenko. and
V. H. Timofeyev have traveled to Osman University to give lectures.
organize scientific work. and direct teacher trainees on the job. As-
sociate: of the department have participated in programs of scientific-
technicnl aid to India (V. P. Nomokonov and D. S. Dayev).

Docent V. P. Nomokonov helped organize the subdepartment of explora-
tion geophysics and the geophysics specialization at the Sofia Mining
Geological Institute. Professor Yu. V. Yekubovskiy spent two years
as head of the subdepartment of geophysics at the Algerian petroleum
center. Docent V. V. Chebykin is head of the department of physics
at the Algerian Polytechnic Institute today. Associates of the sub-
dcpartment have taught at institutes of various countries for many
years: professor I. I. Gurvich at the Beijing Geological Exploration
Institute: docent C. C. Viktorov at the Guinea Polytechnic Institute:
professor C. Is. Tumarkin at the Sofia Mining Geological Institute and
the shumanskiy Pedagogical I stitute in Bulgaria. Associates of the
department are providing scientific consultation to various higher
educational institutions and science-production organizations in
foreign countries today on the basis of contracts for cooperation.

The department is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the institute
by strengthening the educational and indoctrination process further.
developing scientific research work. and improving its efficiency
while focusing the efforts of the entire collective of teachers. asso-
ciates. and students on meeting the challenges posed by the 25th CPSU
Congress.

[Article by 8.“. Hatveyev: "Organization of Scientific and Technical
Propaganda in a Scientific-Research Institute)

[Text] in speeding up scientific and technical progress as a docisive fac-
tor in boosting the efficiency of socialized production. a sajor role belongs
to scientific and technical propaganda—an inportant part of scientific in-
forsation activity. Today it is inpoasible to ensure effective adoptim of
scientific and technical achievements without wide-scale propaganda of then,
that is, dieselinntion, elucidation and publication.

The scientific and technical propaganda group of the departnent of scientific
and technical inforaation at the Ural Scientific-Research and Planning Insti-
tute of Construction Materials (Uralhllstrosproyekt) consists of an engineer
for scientific and technical propaganda. two artists-designers and a photo-
grapher. A nudwer of functions connected with the dissenination of achieve-
seats of science and technology are perforned by personnel of other subdivi-
sions of the depart-ant of scientific and technical inforsation; preparation
of information sheets, publication of scientific works, reco-endations and
methodological instructions are done by the editorial and publications group,
while the abstracting of descriptions of the sore significant inventions by
colleagues of the institute recouended for adoption is performed by the pat-
cnt and licensing group.

The purpose of scientific md technical propaganda is dissemination of the
latest scientific and technical achievements tested in practice and of ad-
vmced production experience on the scale of the industry or of the country
as a whole. In the work of the group. use is sade of the most popular for-s,
nethods and scans of disseminating scientific end production aid technical
achievements that neat the requirements of concreteness. parauasivenesa. wide
accessibility. systematic character, consistency. clarity and understndebil-

raisinp, productivity of labor, econony of Ietel. construction materials,

energy resources and the like. The exhibits infora scientific and engineer-
ing and technical personnel of the newest scientific and technical achieve-
ments in the USSR and abroad; Iodels, samples of noterials and diagrams of

new production lines are prepared for then (the exhibits are accoavpmied by
labels and explanatory sheets).

A permanent ezduibition dealing with probleas of econon of aetal and other
construction sateriala is to be found at the institute. Develops-eats of the
institute are widely represented in the exhibition hall of the RSFSR Hinistrv
of Construction Materials. At the exhibit dealing with work in econosly of
nets! organised by the Chelyabinsk CPSU Oblton, the Center of Scientific ad
Technical intonation. and the (blast Trade-Union Council, five works of the
institute were shown; three of these had been displayed at the USSR Exhibi-

tion of National Econonic Achieve-eats and received two diplonas and several
medals.

M interesting exhibition was conducted by the institute—"Contributim of
Scientific aid Technical Intonation Services to the Performance of Scientif-
ic Research work at the Level of World newness." the aaterials of which dealt
with information servicing of leading scientific developmnts of the insti-
tute and illuainate the effectiveness of the develop-eats (econonic gains of

introduction. econow of Intel and construction materials, energy resources
and the like).

A subdivision of scientific and technical propaganda has a calendar card file
of conferences. Ieetings. seninars and the like planned in the country. The
file includes the nest iaportant topics of conferences and seninars drawn
free the annual plans of the hinistry of Construction Hateriala, scientific
and technical departments of "Stroyindustriya." scientific and technical
propaganda houses, centers of scientific and technical infernation. scien-
tific societies. institutes and so on. It is possible to find out about
forthcoming international conferences free the "Bulletin of Comercial
lnfomtion."

The subdivision of scientific and technical infomtion cospiles the necessary

documentation. keeps records and provides methodological assistance to
specialists.

The department of scientific and technical infomtion jointly with the
Orelyabinsk information Center mnually makes one or two short film on
the significant developnents of the institute. The scientific developments

of the institute are systelatically proposer dized on television, radio. in
the local and central press and by way of infomtion sheets. As a rule,

colleagues of the depart-est of scientific and technical infer-aria: appear

[Text] The scientific and technical translation section created ten years
ago under the Oral Ilouae of Scientific and Technical Propaganda (UMP) of
the aniye Society has established close ties with the country's scien-
tmc centers (vm [All-Union Center of Propaganda” All-Union

binsk's higher educational institutions (university. polytechnic and pads-
gogic institutes. Institute of Hechanization md Electrification of Agricul-
ture) and with higher educational institutions of the Ural region.

The chief defect of nethodological work with translators in regional creative
associations, such as NTP [scientific-technical propaganda] sections under
managing boards of scientific-technical departsents. has been and still is
lack of necessary attention paid to theoretical training of translators. Our
"11' section has been able to overcose this deficiency to a significant degree
by involving scientists and specialists from the fields of philosophy, logic,
sociology and psychology in the work of the section.

Section personnel acquaint translators with translation theory and inculcate
in the. the necessary techniques of practical work and also inforn then of
present-day achieve-ants in the field of social-political and economic
sciences.

Skills of translators of scientific and technical literature and docunenta-
tion are upgraded by study at the "Polytechnical hinimn” school-seminar,

Preface

Experimental studies of uranium-water gratings have been a significant
contribution to the development of “NBC reactors. Experiments to study
the physical characteristics of the active zones of “NBC reactors were
began at the initiative of Academician I. V. Kurchstov and performed
under his direction on critical test installations at the Institute of
Atomic Energy imeni I. V. Kurchatov beginning in 1956. This study is
continuing today on critical test installations and also on reactors
that are in operation or being launched.

Various conceptions of the reactor experiment were used broadly and
fully in investigating HHHC reactors. This provided the basis for de-
veloping research techniques.with due regard for the characteristics

of uranium-water gratings.which greatly expand the potential of the
reactor experiment. with the development and refinement of experi-
mental technology. in particular electronic equipment. methods of study-
ing HHHC reactors were refined and simplified and their accuracy became
greater.

As a result, a vast program of experimental investigation of uranium-
water gratings has been performed beginning with study of the funda-
mental possibility of obtaining a self-supporting fission reaction and

ending with the development of powerful series-produced HHHC reactors.

the most couon reactors in nuclear power. Methods of calculating the
active zones of WC reactors were worked out on the basis of experi-
mental data obtained from critical test installations and operating re-
actors. Fuel reloading and reactor control have been refined and the
reliability and safety of operating atomic power plants with HIM: re-
actors have been improved. Further research aims at study of the ac-
tive zones of even more powerful and economical reactors of this type.

The primary emphasis today is being placed on experiments conducted on
operating wawc reactors. Various techniques have been developed for
this which make it possible to conduct studies at atomic power plants.
The primary purpose of these experiments is to study the physical char-
acteristics of active comes under operating conditions.

The present work describes the experiments that precede launching WC
reactors in operation. it attempts to show the outline and order of
conducting experiments that have been developed during the research
process and. in the opinion of the author. could be useful to other re-
searchers. Some of the experiments on uranium-water gratings were con-
ducted long ago. but the author considers it worthwhile to describe
them because they are interesting to researchers and may be used in
investigation of active zones. Descriptions of them may be found in
articles and reports.

The book does not give a great deal of data on results of studies. If
readers wish they may consult the appropriate primary sources. which
are indicated by references. The point is that data obtained in ex-
periments on freshly loaded active zones of mac reactors change as
the reactor is used. but the character of the experimental investiga-
tion. method, and ideology remain the same.

The author does not claim to cover the subject in full because the
process of improving research is a continuous one: new measurement
techniques are being developed and new issues and problems arise.

In conclusion, the author considers it a pleasant duty to express
gratitude to doctor of technical sciences S. A. Skvortsov, candidate
of technical sciences c. L. Lunin. and candidate of technical sciences

A. N. Novikov for examining the manuscript and making valuable com-
ments.

[text] This sonograph is concerned with the elaboration of scientific
foundations of the seth of crystal growth tron solutions and selts.
Theoretical concepts of solubility and crystallisation are considered.
Quantitative physical chesical characteristics of nulticosponential sys-
tens used to grow crystals are presented. Crystal growing is linked with
the thersodynasic state of a solution and with change in kinetics or
crystallization. Fundamental technological parameters of spontaneous and
controlled crystallization are associated with the sorphology and se-
chanics of crystal growth.

Intended for scientific workers and engineers involved in growing crystals
fro. solutions and melts. Tables 70: illustrations 151. references 869.
