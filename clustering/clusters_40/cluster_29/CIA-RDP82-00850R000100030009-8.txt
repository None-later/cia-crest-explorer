[Text] Tokyo (Radio Press)--At 1835 [0315 GMT] Japan time on 27 January,
Beijing [Peking] Radio in its program "Various Parts of the Motherland"
introduced Taiwan under the title [beautiful and affluent Taiwan." Touch-
ing on Diaoyudao [Tiaoyutao] (the Chinese name for the Senkaku Islands),
the radio said: "Over 100 large and small islands, including the Penghu
and Dieoyudao Islands, encircle Taiwan like pearls inlaid on s tray."

(HOMIURI editor's note: Concerning the question of ovnership of the
Senkaku Islands, during his visit to Japan last October to attend the
signing cerenony for the Japan-China peace and friendship treaty. Vice
Prenier Deng Xiaoping [Teng Hsieo-ping] expressed the desire to tempo-
rarily shelve the issue for solution by the next generation. The 27 Janu-
ary broadcast is the first official Chinese report to mention the Senkaku
Islands since Deng nade his renarks. On 16 January, Transport Minister
Moriyana disclosed a Maritime Safety Agency plan to build s heliport in
the Senksku Islands. In this context, this reference to Diaoyudao by
Beijing Radio deserves our attention.)

HELP ON TAIWAN ISSUE-A top-level official of the Foreign Ministry disclosed
on the evening of 8 February that Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping had told
Foreign Minister Sonoda that "free now on He nay need the help of Mr Nadao
late than we need yours." According to this official, Deng made the resark
during his norning conversation with Sonoda on a future visit to China of
House of Representatives Speaker Nadao. That sane day. the Japanese
foreign minister called on Deng at his hotel to bid hin farevell. Earlier.
during a 7 February dinner party given in his honor by Prime Minister Ohira,
Vice Premier Deng personally asked Nadao to visit China. It has been said
that China expects Nadao to play a role in achieving Taiwan's peaceful
unification with the mainland since Nadao enjoys the great confidence of

the Taiwan leaders. Vice Prenier Deng's relark is regarded as support for
this speculation. [Text] [Tokyo YOHIURI SRINBUN in Japanese 9 Feb 79

STATUS. PROSPECTS 0? PRO IDTOR VERICLB INDUSTRY REPORTED
Tokyo um KOGYO sumuu in Japanese 5 Dec 78 p 11

[Text] Currently the People's Republic of china (PRC)
is inplenenting a Motor Vehicle Production Expansion
Plan—a transportation bulwark essential to sodomize-
tion. Lately Oiina's requests to the Japanese [auto]
Innufacturers to cooperate in its venture have in-
creased. Thus we investigated the current status of
the PRC motor vehicle industry and its future prospects.

It is said that the PRC's population is in excess of 1 billion. The total
productivity for 1976 was $32!. billion and per capita productivity was ap-
proxinstsly $340. These figures vis-a-vis the Japanese productivity
standard represent the level for around 1958. After the ousting of the
"gang of four." the PRC has esbraced four sodernisation goals-agriculture,
industry, national defense. and science and technology. In March of this
year. it launched a Ten-Year Plan for Developing the National Econoey as
a neans to realize these goals within this century. As far as the indus-
trial category is concerned. the industrial production growth rate is set
at a little over 10 percent per annua. and the plan is to increase crude
steel production 2.5 tines by l985--to expand the 1977 tally of 25.6 nil-
lion tons to 60 million tons. Needless to say. in conjunction with the
expansion of crude steel production. notor vehicle production-the axial
force in transportation—will also be enlarged.

It is said that in Asia. the only country outside of Japan that can manage
Iotor vehicle production on its own is China. The current status. however,
as seen iron the 1977 record is that the largest plant, the Ch'ang-ch'un
Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Plant Nutter 1, produced 60.000 trucks and
150 passenger cars. or a total of 60.150 notor vehicles. This plant is

on a 1.5 Iillion square neter site and the buildings occupy 660,000 square
neters. The gromds and plant buildings are significantly larger than
those of. the Toyota Motor Industry‘s Takaoka plant (lot site: 1.3 aillion
square asters; buildings: 690,000 square neters; annual production ca-
pacity: 700.000 vehicles). It is said that aside fro- the Ch'ang-ch'un
plant. there are about 10 nore plants with an annual production capacity

in excess of 1.000 vehicles. There are 30 to 60 vehicle types in produc-
tion. Over 90 percent of these are col-arcisl-use vehicles such as trucks.
The total production figure is 120,000 to 130.000 vehicles per year. still
quite low. In terse of both "hard" and "soft" vehicle categories. growth
is still a thing of the future.

The steps that China had taken to establish the current production for-net
are as follows: the PRC imrted a plant from the Soviet Union and con-
nenced building the Ch'eng—ch'un Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Plant Number I
in 1953. The plant began operation in 1956. This was the first step in
the Pkc's aoter vehicle production. Under the Great Leap Forward policy.
there was a proliferation of production plants; coupled with the confusion
of the Cultural Revolution. notor vehicle production entered a period of
non-growth. About 1970. the ester vehicle plants having been taken over
by city and provincial authorities. s stable period was initiated; since
1977. growth has been steady.

The number of vehicles that the PRC possesses at this tine is said to be
between 1 million and 1.5 million. The nsjority have been in use for 10 to
20 years and about one-third are believed not to be functioning. The in-
port status is between 15.000 and 20.000 per year. end is thought to repre-
sent 2 percent of total iaports. The total nuﬂaer of iaported vehicles
appears to have reached some 600.000. of this nuﬁer. 200.000 were pur-
chased fron the Soviet Union and East European states prior to 1963. After
1961.. with worsening relations between the P110 and the Soviet Union. in-
portation from the West superseded importation fro- the commist bloc.

The highest inpert value is represented by Japanese vehicles. and as a
result of a closer relationship between the two countries. further expan-
sion of Japanese ilports is the anticipated trend.

Let us look at the relationship between the asjor notor vehicle plants and
the political structure and regional adninistrative organs. China's motor
vehicle production is inplenented by its 29 provincial. city and autononous
regions throughout the country. The plants having an independent production
capability are situated in large cities--Ch'ang-ch'm, Peking. Shang-hai.
Nen-ching. Chi-nan. These major plant: are dually controlled by the cen-
tral national organ's First Mechanical Industry Division, Motor Vehicle
Section and regional sdninistrstive organs. The National Long-Range Con-
prehensive Regulatory Plan for Hotor Vehicle Harmfscture eaanates fro-

the central government's First Hechanical Industry Division, and local ad-
ninistrative governments have charge of personnel and labor regulations.
Under this dual control. China's aster vehicle industry is steadily expand-
ing. How. vehicle parts can be produced entirely within the PRC. But due
to the fact that there is a shortage of steel and other basic asterials.
deaand and production have not been able to cone to terms. Even under
such difficult circumstances. efforts are being made to develop co-on
parts for various models and to reduce costs. In concrete terns. the
Peking brand jeep. Peking brand truck and T'ien-ching branch aicrobus s11
eaploy a canon engine. Several vehicle types selected as popular aodels
are said to have ssny other co-on parts.

Needless to mention. the current status of the PRC motor vehicle industry
is quite inferior in every respect to its Western counterparts, but it is
also a fact that the PRC is actively developing the motor vehicle produc-
tion industry as one aspect of modernization. Since the ousting of the
"gang of four," there have been active exchanges between China and the
motor vehicle manufacturers of various western states.

Let us examine the recent foreign overtures made by China. In late Decem-
ber 1977, the PRC Mechanized Work Progress Institute made a request to the
Association of Japanese Automobile Manufacturers for cooperation in dis-
patching 100 PRC trainees. In addition, in April 1978, while the economic
mission headed by Lin Mu—chis [2651 0039 0502] (present City of Peking
Revolutionary Council chairman) was visiting the Association of Japanese
Automobile Manufacturers, he spoke of a plan to renovate and expand the
Shang-hai Motor Vehicle Plant and put out a feeler regarding Japanese
cooperation in the project. During April to May 1978, the PRC Motor
Vehicle Industry Survey Comission, which included the First Mechanical
Industry Division under secretary, the Motor Vehicle Section chief, and

so on toured various European countries.

In the meantime, the Western mnnufacturers' overtures toward the PRC have
been very active. It began when Mitsubishi jiko [Mitsubishi Automobile
Manufsc‘ ring Company] and Isuzu Motors, Ltd submitted a plan for a large-
size trucl. manufacturing plant during the latter half of 1977 and the
early part of 1978. About the same time, Mercedes-Benz, Fiat, Volvo, and
Renault also sent similar plans to China. In June 1978, Mitsubishi jilto
accepted the trainees from the Ch'ang-ch'un Motor Vehicle Manufacturing
Plant Number 1 and began training them. In June 1978, Henry Ford II
visited China; in September 1978, the Toyota Survey Conission visited
Peking, and President Kubo of Mitsubishi jiko as well; in October, General
Motors Chairman of the Board Murphy, as well as a survey conission dis-
patched by Mitsubishi jiko, Isuzu Motors, Mino Motors, Ltd and Toyota went
to the People's Republic of China.

Imediate Emphasis on Trucks

With regard to the future of the PRC's motor vehicle industry. production
is expected to reach 610,000 vehicles by 1990--exportation: 20,000; sales:
(065,000; and importation: 75,000. Regarding vehicle types to be manu-
factured, the emphasis for the time being will be on truck production in
order to achieve the aforementioned four modernization goals. It is not
likely that private ownership of passenger cars will be recognized.

Moreover, in the case of China, due to its adherence to the principle of
"attaining success by overcoming difficulties." it cannot admit foreign
capital to increase productivity under a joint management format. It does
not seem possible that China would ever become an attractive market for
Japan or the Western states. But since at present the Japanese and Euro-
pean manufacturers are actively submitting their opinion papers regarding
plants, and are very supportive, it would appear that there will probably
