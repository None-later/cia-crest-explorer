PLANTS REPORTED ACCEPTING JAPANESE DBLIVERIES UNDER SUSPENDED CONTRACTS
Tokyo THE DAILY YOHIURI in English 1 Sep 81 p 3

[Article by Swadesh De Roy]

[Text] The Chinese may have suspended many of their plant orders with the
Japanese, but they are accepting deliveries the Japanese are making on the

dead contracts. This can happen only between China and Japan, the two countries
prepared to do anything to accommodate each other by going far out of their way.
Theirs, after all, is a unique relationship.

Chinese acceptance of Japanese shipments of plants for projects canceled is a
quiet development, so far unpublicized. It has. however. created an unorthodox
situation in Sino-Jspanese trade and economic cooperation. Apparently there is
no formal agreement on this beyond an informal understanding.

To an outsider it will appear as though the Japanese are forcing these plants on
the Chinese, who on their part are accepting than without changing their position
that they have canceled orders for the shipments being received. The Chinese
acceptance of the shipments also does not constitute any agree-ant to compensate
losses the Japanese claim to have suffered following unilateral cancellation of
plant orders.

But then who is paying the suppliers? According to my information, not the
Chinese, not immediately that is. It should be recalled they canceled the orders
because they had suspended the projects for which the plants and equipment now
being shipped were needed; and they suspended the projects because they did not
have enough cash. Nothing has changed since in that Chinese position. But the
Chinese have also said the projects have merely been put off and it appears the
Japanese supplies are taking the Chinese at their word, literally. What follows
from this is that the Chinese seem to be saying that if the suppliers at their
end can arrange to be paid the shipments will be accepted at their end--stored
unopened for one or two years or till the projects are revived-snd till then
the plants and equipment will remain in Chinese custody. Does this bind the
Chinese in any way? Yes, but only morally; and that is all that the Japanese
wanted.

The Japanese, aeanwhile, are doing everything to get their government and banks
to help the Chinese by arranging aid and supplier's credit. And the Chinese

3

agreeing to be morally bound are taking the fullest advantage of the situation.
bargaining harder than ever for terms. They have nothing to lose, with crates
of plant already in their warehouses at nobody quite knows whose risk. The
Japanese suppliers in their eagerness to be paid are using all their influence
to obtain government accommodatiOn for the Chinese. And the Chinese are close
to getting some $300 billion in credit on various terns, thanks oaths business-
men's lobbying.

That may solve 90 percent of the financing problem in respect of these shipments.
The Chinese have raised a fine legal point. They insist on holding up 10 percent
of the payment which under the terms of old contracts will be payable only after
plant certification that in this case should not be expected until the Chinese
open the crates. But they will not open the shipment until they decide to re-
vive the suspended projects. The Japanese suppliers do not agree. Their plea

is this 10 percent of payment normally withheld as "retention money" pending
certification includes technicians' fee and their own profit. what the Chinese
say to this is logically solid. Tschniciana' services will not be called for
until the crates are opened, plants inspected. installed, and certified.

Until then there should be no question of paying the retained 10 percent.

There is nothing the Japanese can do. They have. after all, volunteered into
this situation. The Chinese do not feel to be under any legal obligation. They,
indeed, had placed some orders. But after having canceled then they no longer
are bound by then. The present shipments are not their idea. Just because the
Japanese have on their own chosen to make deliveries the Chinese are not going
to revise their schedules for the suspended projects.

The Japanese in their last-ditch bid to nove the Chinese from their rigid position
are now telling the Chinese the equipment in crates unopened for even a year may
get rusted and daaaged. But the Chinese are unmoved. If the plants corrode they
will not pass certification test. And that will be a suppliers' liability.

The Japanese obviously are in a painful bind. But they believe the Chinese ulti-
mately will come to free then from the trap they did not set. The Japanese en-
trapped thenselves to evoke Chinese sympathies they desperately needed to ensure
that the suspended projects when revived come back to then. What they are doing
now is demonstrating their desperation and suffering. That is the way of Sino-
Japanese business.

This is because shipments to

PRC,JAPAN FERTILIZER EXPORTS--Tokyo. 21 Sep (JIJI PRESS)--Japan and China eigned an
agreement in Beijing (Peking) Monday on chemical fertilizer exports to that country
in the first half of the 1981 fertilizer year (July-Deenber). Under the accord,
Japan will export 150,000 tons of a-oniun aulfate and 380,000 tone of urea. both
unchanged from the previous half-year period. Shipmenta will be made fro. this Ionth
to January next year. Export prices of eucniul sulfate and urea have been lowered
by 10 percent each from the previoue period, reflecting the eeaing demand-supply
situation of nitrogenous fertilizers. The total export value ia estimated at 106.7
