[YOHIURI SRIHBUN 18 December editorial: "China Must Help Itaelf"]

[Text] frankly, the Japanese side was somewhat cool toward the second Japan-
China ministerial conference held in Tokyo, not only because it was a structured
meeting, but chiefly because China has tended to change its economic policy
drastically.

Chinese economic policy shifts were particularly pronounced this year as the
country tried to cope with financial deficits and inflation. Emphasis shifted
back and forth from heavy industry to light industry. As a result, China
canceled import orders for large amounts of Japanese plant equipment.

The extensive Chinese policy changes not only stunned the Japanese business
community. but also jolted the Japanese public's general confidence in China.

Sometime last summer, the Chinese got their economic program back into shape
and again placed importance on heavy industry. Meantime. the two countries
have reached a settlement of the plant import cancellation problem. Japan
has agreed to provide yen 300 billion in credits.

Unstable Factors
However, this agreement has not restored mutual confidence.

Although we have no intention of meddling in China's domestic and international
economic affairs. we suggest that China itself has already realized that
overabrupt changes in policy have a negative effect. In this connection, we
must note that China must be deliberate in seeking Western partners in its
modernization program.

There are several other unstable elements in Sino-Japanese economic relations.
One of them is the correction of the trade imbalance in favor of Japan. A steady
increase in Chinese coal exports to Japan is essential to erase China's trade
deficit. But prospects of this happening do not look bright.

Poo: Use of Loans

Another problem is that China has not been making efficient use of Japanese
yen loans. Prior to the latest bilateral conference, the Suzuki administra-
tion decided to extend China yen 60 billion in yen loans for the current
fiscal year.

This step represented support for the present Chinese leadership from a political
standpoint. He endorse this move. But we regret that China is not putting
these yen loans to good use.

Chinese vice-premier Cu Hu told a press meeting that Sine-Japanese relations
would progress well when China's rich natural resources and Japan's money
and technology are combined.

Chinese leaders have often made such statements, but they need to recognize
that the Iain responsibility for China's economic development rests with China
itself. Japanese assistance is fruitless without proper Chinese economic
management.

We wish to see China make economic progress and for this purpose it must go
ahead with appropriate reforms.

ernment's income does not
increase as much as the
workers' income does.
Besides. the tax rate is
high for luxury goods and

billion yuan in new.

The «out corresponds to
a little over lo percent or

the Japanese Government's

that the situation is much

Hasty Policy

Iiii Chinese government
leaders whom this reporter
met said that the deﬁcit in
the government‘s budget
resulted from excessive in-
vestments in factory equip-
ment. in the development
of mines and civil engineer-
ing and construction prol-
ects. They added: "We were
too hasty in modernizing our
country."

Certainly, that is part of
the reason behind the fin-
ancial dimculty facing the
government. Take the go'-
ernment’s ilscal 1000 bud-
let. for example. The gov-
ernment originally planned
to spend to billion yuan for
investments in various in-
dustrial projects. .But 'i
ended up spending 64 bil-
lion yuan for that purpose.
The extra s billion yuan
spent by the government
contributed to its deilcit.
But this is not the only fac-
tor involved.

Let us examine the new i,
policies that the govern-
ment carried out during the
past three years. it raised
the prices at which it buys
agricultural products from
farmers. The government
granted subsidies to the
people's communes to en-
able them to reform them-
selves. it also granted sub-
sidies to enterprises in the
light industries. And the
government increased wages
for city workers. ,There are
numerous such exertipies.

The wage increases in-
cluded those called “pay-
ments to retrieve the honor
of persons who Were de-
famed." These were made
to people unjustly criti-
cised or demoted during
the cultural revolution and
amounted to more than 1
billion yuan—not a small
sum. .

The Chinese Govern-
ment's budget deficit has
mulled not only from ear-

from a number of factors
such as decreases in the
government's income and
the execution of many new

policies. The government.
however. covered up these
factors. escept excessive

investments. and reduced
funds for investments ,in
iiseal mi. The amount
corresponded to to percent
of that in the previous
fiscal year.

But to say the govern-
ment rnede excessive in-
vestments in past years is
not fair at all.

Priority Projects
The main road leading
from Guangzhou to “scan
is rough and bumpy. And
there are no bridges over
four rivers running across
the road. so people must
use ferries to eso- the
rivers. The lack oi bridges
and other facilities in China
only inconveniences
people but also hampers
economic activity.

Vice-Premier Wan Li said:
"Although us are cutting
investment, we will give
priority to prolects for road
construction and energy
since the
total amount oi investment
has been cut greatly, him-
ever. the government can-
not spend much on those
proiects. even if they are
given priority.

The budget of e govern-
ment is something which
must be balanced well. if
the government's income
and its expenditure are not
balanced and the govern-
ments money is not spent
fairly. the budget would
collapse. if the people do
not like to pay taxes, then
the government should slow
down its work to improve
their living conditions.

The Chinese Government
cannot expect to rehabili-
tate itself financially and
lower inﬂation if it is con-
tent to regard investments
for various projects as vil-
ininous.

Thanh to the uocedurai
reiorm. banks themelvcs
have become increasingly

to extend loans.

A recent report by the
Wuhan branch or the Peo-
ple's Bank on its ioliow-
up investigation of 100
cases or its loaning says
one oi the enterprises
which are loaned by funds
the bank “made proﬁts at

in rule oi lo yuan per one
yuan it borrowed. simply
because the enterprise went
all—out to repay the loan.”

Although the report
should be taken with some
reservation because it
covers loans only ior pro-
duction equipment invest-
ment: in the lightalndus-
try sector. there now is
little doubt that bank
loans in China have be-
gun to move smoothly.

With the increase in
bank loans. a system ior
“solvency screening" oi
loan requests also has been
put into practice.

According to Qlu Chang-
yao. vice-director in charge

hou iCanionl branch oi

prises desiring to get loans
are asked without excep-
tion to submit written ap-

ior which the enterprises
are golnii to use the bor-
rowed iunds.

GRCRING GONEWNT RELIANCE ON NATIONAL BONDS SEEN

Tokyo TRE DAILY YOMIURI in English 3 Dec 81 p 5

[Article by Yoshio Hetsui]

[Text]

This year the Chinese

.Oovernment issued nation-

al bonds amounting to 5
billion yuan (one yuan
equals about also». It was
the ﬁrst time in many
years that the government
had taken such an action.
This was an epoch-making
event because the previous
lssulng or national bonds
had taken place in the

distant past.

There a no problem in
getting the‘ bonds under-
written because the gov-
ernment practically allots

them to various organimo
tions. Zuo Chuntai. director
oi the secretariat oi the
Finance Ministry. said:
"Almost all natlonal bonds
have been underwritten by
local governments. enter-
prises. maior people's com-
munes and other organisa-
tions. 80 far. no individual
has been allowed to buy
national bonds."

For example. Shanghai
City was allotted national
bonds totaling 400 million
yuan. Of this total. 300
million yuan were allotted
to ﬁrst-rate enterprises
and people's communes in
the city and the remaining
amount was underwritten
by the municipal govern-
ment.

Zhang Deng. chairman of
the municipal economic
committee. said: “There
were almost no problem.
The negotiations tor the

underwriting ot the bomb
progreaed quite smoothly."

Even the Wuhan steel
plant. which is having
financial dimculty result-
ing from the government's
policy or adjusting steel
production. has underwrit-
ten national bonds amount-
ing to lo million yuan by
using part oi its savings.

Port Of Assets

‘l‘ang Zongse. director of
the accounts oiiice or a
watch manuiacturing cor-
pOration in Chongoutng.
said: ”We eagerly bought
national hunch totaling
400.000 vuan. We retard
them as part oi ouraseets.”

He mid not have said
that the bonds were part
or the corporation's assets.
it he did not trust the
government at all. its said
so. because he trusted the
government. even though
the bonds were allotted to
the corporation by the
government. ills statement
showed that national bonds
were being accepted well
and the Chinese people
have begun. though gra.
dually. to trust their gov-
ernment.

like national bonds in
Japan. national bonds
issued by the Chinese Gov-
ernment are good (or :0
years. But national bonds
in China are diaerent trom
those in Japan in that the
rate of interest on them is

9

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

only four percent per an-
num and the government
begins to redeem them live
years after they are issued.
The government chooses by
lot the 'bonds to be re-
deemed.

But the interest rate of
tour percent is relatively
huh in China. considering
that the interest rate at
citiaens' deposits in the,
people's banks is extremely
low—1.8 percent per an-
num. no national bards in
China are an “attractive
merchandise,” so to speak.

Vogue Details
Yet China. unlike Japan.;
has no bond markets. What
happens to the Chinese
Government's bonds which
have been bougirt by vari-
ous organisations? This re-
oporter asked an omelet or
the Chinese 'l‘inance moo
istry.
here are some 0! the
questions and answers that
we exchanged.

Does the government
permit various organisa-
tions to resell national
bonds?

"We are considering that
now.”

but there the possibility
oi an organisations going
bankrupt with national
bonds?

“The situation has not
yet reached that stage."
is there a system under
WRIGHT :

10:

which the government buys
up national bonds?

"We are considering that
too."

In short. the details oi
the national bond plan
have not yet been worked
out. The Chinese Govern-
ment issues national bonds
without. deciding what to
do with them In the inture.
Small wonder the bonds
were issued not tor the ile-
cal 1981 budget but to
make up to: the deiicit oi
12 billion yuan which had
developed in the iiscal loco
budget.

So the government de-
scribes the issuing oi na-
tional bonds as "a ten).
porary measure.” This de-
scription is correct. For the
government did not Issue
any national bonds ior the
fiscal 1981 budget. The gov-
ernment reduced the sine
oi the budget tor the cur-
rent decal year by draso
ticaliy curtailing Its invest-
menu.

Income 'Sonree

Certainly, it will be good
It the government's budget
is balanced well and the
government can do without
issuing national bonds. But
Is that possible in China?
China cannot stop its drive

ior liberalisation. The prea-
sure ior Increases In the
government's expenditure
will grow iurther In the
future. even though China
is a country with a govern-
ment which Is good at con-
trolling the people.

it the government can

to make up tor the rise in
its expenditure. there will
be no problem. But that is
not likely. So the govern-
ment must and a new
source oi income to operate
Its.bndget.

This reporter ieela that
the government should in.
troduce a normal national
bond plan. The government
should also consider issuing
bonds to raise money to
build roads and bridges. to
improve and e port
and harbor i lltlea as
well as rivers. instead oi
issuing bonds Just to make
up a deﬁcit In its budget.

become treeless becnuse oi
the government's iailure to

Tokyo after reaching an agreement that Japan would extend 300 billion yen for
China's construczion of the Daqing petrochemical complex and the Baoshan
steelworks, and also 60 billion yen in loans for the current fiscal year.

Regular ministerial meetings are essential for the deepening of mutual under-
standing between the two governments' leaders. Since the first ministerial
meeting, the Sino-Japanese relations have been at a low ebb to some extent due
to the Chinese annulment of the export contracts of Japanese industrial plants
or its postponement of the plants.

The latest meeting was expected to offer a good chance for the two countries

to restore a strong relationship. The signing of the Japanese extension of
funds for the construction of the industrial plants met such an expectation,
putting an end to the disputes resulting from the Chinese annulment or post-
ponement of the plans. Together with the 60 billion yen in credits. the agree-
ment is expected to open new prospects for bilateral economic cooperation in
the future.

During the two-day conference, the Chinese ministers repeated criticisms of the
Soviet hegemonism and reconfirmed their basic policy for the improvsment of
cooperative relations with Japan and the United States. They said that China
wanted to cover its shortage of funds with the introduction of foreign capital
for the promotion of its modernization programs.

The Japanese counterparts expressed their readiness to cooperate actively with
the Chinese economic policy. He believe it quite reasonable for Japan to
support China as long as China maintains an open economic system aimed at a
stable development.

It is too hasty to conclude that the two-day meeting could completely erase
mutual concerns and helped the two countries to take new steps for stronger
relations. We cannot deny the existence among the Japanese economic circles
of a deep-rooted distrust toward the unstable Chinese economic policies.

In his recent policy speech, Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang said the Chinese
economy had overcome a crisis but added that a potential crisis still remained,
adding that China needed five or more years to complete its economic adjustment
and improve the managerial system.

Difficulties in the economic management are indicated by the fact that the
Chinese Government had been unable to disclose the blueprints of the current
Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-1985) and the new 10—year program‘(1981-l990).

mac also said in his report that china planned to triple agricultural produc-
tion by the end of this century. Some have expressed skepticism concerning
this because, to attain such a target, China must realize an annual economic
growth of six percent.

Under such circlmstances, the Japanese economic cooperation to China must
correspond to the reality of the Chinese economic situation. We do not support
an idea that the more the Japanese financial aid. the stronger the Sine-Japanese
ties would become. He must remember that an excessively gigantic economic aid
to china would compel Southeast Asian nations to look suspiciously at the future
Tokyo-Beijing relations.

China and Japan will greet the 10th year in 1982 of the establishment of normal
diplomatic relations and we expect the mutual visits of prime ministers. During
the past decade, the trade volume expanded from $700 million to $10,000 million

and the number of Japanese visitors to China increased from 9.000 to 90,000.
We must maintain this trend.

The ministers have agreed to have official talks. early next year if possible,

for the Japanese import of Chinese oil and coal from 1983 to 1985. The joint
press statement issued after the meeting said that the two countries must conclude
agreements on taxation and investors' protection, and the promotion of the opening
of a regular freight services.

We hope that the two countries will steadily solve pending problems one by one
to further strengthen the Sins-Japanese relationship.
