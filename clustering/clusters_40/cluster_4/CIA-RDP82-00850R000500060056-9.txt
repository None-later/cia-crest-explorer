HANSWERS AMONG LDP PACTIONS REPORTED
Tokyo SANKBI SEMI!" in Japanese 22 Apr p 2

[Article by Reporter Shino Kobayashi: "Tuzska Paction's Countermeasure A-
gainst Three Anti-Suzuki Factions.”

[Text] Hith the party presidential election this fall as the backdrop. and
with the budget deficit problem and the first court ruling on a politician
defendant in the Lockheed incident. the move-ant of factional opinions within
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have begun to appear. Both the Pukuda and
Nakagawa factions. estimating the future political situation, have already de-
cided to hold their factional in-service training conferences. and on the ﬂat
the Kauamoto faction also announced it will have its factional in-service
training conference in September. And in opposition to the attitude of these
three factions of trying to upset the Suzuki and Tanaka factions, the Tanaka
faction also set up a governing board meeting and meetings for the mainstay
party when and younger members, and will begin tightening up the bonds of
unity in preparation for the future political situation. Hith the end of the
Diet near at hand. there is the smell of blood in the movements of these vari-
ous factions.

At its regular general meeting on the 71st, the Tanaka faction's "llanoka-kai,"
created by Diet members electeu less than five times to the house of Represen-
tatives. decided to hold a conference right after the consecutive holidays
(Golden Week holidays) and invite former Prime Minister Tanaka. Hith regard
to this, this group's leaders are emphasizing that this has nothing to do
with the movement of the political situation, saying: "this is a regular
'drinking partv' since the end of the Diet session is near."

However. tlu Tanaka faction set up in turn a meeting for those elected to

the House of Representatives six to eight times on the 22nd. and a meeting
for those 91th cabinet experience on the 27th. Fowler Prime Minister Tanaka
is expected to attend all of these meetings. It seems this series of meetings

is for strengthening their unity in preparation for the future political situ-
stion.

This kind of nanewering by the Tanaka faction is not unrelated to the fact
that both the Pukuda and Nakagswa factions quickly announced their factional
training conferences at the beginning of this month. The Fukuda faction's
conference will be held at a hotel in Batons on both the 19th and 20th of
June; and the Nakagaws faction is undecided on the dates and location but
intends to hold it after the Puknda faction's training conference. These
two factions are intensifying their confrontation with both the Suzuki and
Tanaka factions over Prime Hinister Suzuki's reelection. And althought in
the beginning the Tanaka faction officials showed conposure with the com-
nent. "our unity is always firs; it isn't particularly necessary for us to
hold an in-service training conference." it seems they decided to hold sep-
arate meetings for officials and younger nenbers after making the judgnent
that "now is the tine to tighten up the faction."

Likewise. the lawn-ate faction, keeping its eye on the Noveﬁer presidential
election, will hold its training conference at Bakon: for three days. the 6th
through the 6th of Septenber; and further-ore, "it will work out across the
board policies on the economy. foreign affairs and defense at its national
conference for the fornstion of a new 'policy research connittee' expected
on 28 Septenber. This will be the "szanoto govern-eat plan" when Econonic
Planning Agency Minister Kawanoto runs in the presidential election.

The future political situation looks like a schena for confrontation between
the three factions of the Suzuki and “tanks factions. which aim at Suzuki's
reelection. and the Nakasone faction. which wants the support of these two
factions "post-Suzuki," and the Fukuds. Kawamoto and Nskagaws factions. In
this scheme. the Tanaka faction, the "father of Suzuki," has started noving
since these three factions have intensified their "anti-Suzuki attitude."

It seems that the three "anti-Suzuki" factions will col-once firing criticisn
at Suzuki on the budget deficit question, but since Prime Minister Suzuki and
the Tanaka faction sssuns the attitude that "no matter who is in charge of
the government. there are no nirsculous plans; this problem oust be resolved
with the governnent and party united." it is difficult for the three "anti-
Suzuki" factions to attack. In particular. it is difficult for Kawanoto to
act inasmuch as he occupied the position of the "person responsible for the
management of the econony" in the Suzuki cabinet as Minister of the Econoaic
Planning Agency for nearly two years. This is why lava-oto earlier gave warn-
ing to the nanagers of his faction to be careful in their speech and behavior.

Former Prime Minister Pukuda is carefully trying to grasp the change in the
political situation. ”how he is steadfastly watching the course of events."
(Pukuda faction official) And laws-ate himself, like for-er Prime Minister
Fukuda, is taking a "natural" pose.

The Pukuda faction officsls state: "The two points are the budget. deficit
problem and political ethics. Former Prine Minister Pukuds is steadfastly

watching the court ruling on Takayuki Sato and Tonissburo ﬂashimoto on 8
June." The Pukuda faction's tactics are to shake up the Suzuki goveruent

by bringing to the forefront the question of establishing political ethics
which can more easily be "material for attack" thnn can the budget deficit
Issue. Regarding thin, the Tanaka faction officinle are showing they will
stand up and take it, saying "when Pulmde attacks, hie old trick in to talk
about the eeteEliehnent of political ethice."

It seems inevitable that forner Prime Minister Fukuda will work out "the
establishment of political ethics" at his fection'e training conference on
19 June. The view that Pulmde'e words will be the trigger for political
upheaval is increasing within the LDP.

But then. we mum question ii
such is really pow'blc. The
Finance Ministry believes that
"although great eiiorts must be
made to realize a large scale
reduction oi expenditures. that
alone is not enouith to balance
the revenue and expenditures"
Then. is it possible to cover the
revenue by increased ﬂotation
oi dettcttcovering national
bonds by withdrawing the
public pledge oi Prime limlster
Suzuki calling ior "reduction oi
the ﬂotation oi such bonds to
make it ultimately nil in tiscal
ISM“ That would mean the
political suicide oi Prime
MinisterSinutti.

Ultimately there seems to be
no means but a large-scale
increase oi indirect taxes. Since
an income tax cut is inevitable
ior fiscal ”83. an increase in
indirect taxes is believed
necessary not only to matte up
tor the loss resulting irom such
an income tax cut but also to
ensure a large amount oi tax
revenues.

The government has already
started to hint at such a move.
Can Prime minister Suzuki
actually carry it out? There are
now some signs within the
Liberal-Democratic Party to
hold the prime minister to task
and rebel against him. The
Suzuki cabinet now laces the
biggest crisis since it was
inaugurated.

FARM LOBBY OPPOSES INCREASED IMPORTS PRO“ 0.8.

Tokyo THE DAILY YOHIURI in English 26 Apr 82 p 2

“Editorial: "The Fern Iobby"]
[Text]

Agricultural organintions and political parties
are stepping up their opposition to the (seeing and
expansion of farm imports in the face of US de-
mands that increased imports of farm products be
included in the second market opening package to be
decided at a meeting of economic ailairs ministers
on May 7. Meanwhile. the US has moved to discon-
tinue talks at the Japan-US trade subcommittee and
will take the farm import issue to the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade (GA'IT).

The Agriculture. Forestry and Fisheries Commit-
tee of the House of Representatives Thursday adopt-
ed a resolution that proper steps should be taken to
avoid sacriﬁcing farmers and ilshermen in respect to
the liberaiisation of residual imports restrictions and
expansion of import quotas.

Forward-Looking Stance
We don't object to the resolution itself. But pre-
sent import curbs on farm and ﬁshery products should
not be allowed to stand. Imports of beef, oranges
' and juice should be tackled not only from the view.
point of Japan's responsibility in the free world but
also from the position of the people’s interest. The
government needs to take a forward-looking stand
on expansion of import of farm and ilshery products.
The planned second package should reﬂect such
a basic attitude although there may be no time to
work out speciﬁcs. ~
We hope Prime Minister Suzuki will not heed only
the strident voices of agricultural lobbies but will
reach a wise and reasonable decision as the nation's

top leader.
In this respect. the open' circulars issued Thuw

day by the Consumers Union of Japan showed an

extreme attitude in their demands for protection of
domestic agriculture. They called for complete self-
suﬂiciency in grain—both for food and fodder—and
for revision of foreign dependence on staple foods.
We have to doubt whether these demands truly re-
ﬂect the consumers’ attitude.

Anachronistic Thinking

Such thinking is anachronistic. Japan's present
production of beef. pork. chicken and eggs and con-
sequent improvement ln the people's diet was made
possible only because of vast grain imports.

lncslculable funds will be needed if the grains are
to he provided solely by domestic famers. And.
even it complete self-sufﬁciency should be attained.
it will be impossible to maintain the current standard
of diet.

Overprotection of domestic agriculture will only
produce a minus effect.

We deplore the senseless statements of the con-
sumers' union. Such groups should defend the in-
terests of consumers. This is especially so in a so-
ciety where the producers have too much power.
We hope the government and consumers' group will
tackle the agricultural Import problem from this
standpoint.

in 1950. the production of
crude steel in Japan was
only 55 percent compared
with that oi the US. nor
automobile production. the
percentage was aimt aero.
in "so. Japan surpassed
the as by 10 percent in
both crude steel and auto-
mobile production. assen-
tlally. then. since the 08
population is double Ja-

ms. per capita output {or

This massive production. oi
course. cannot be complete-
” absorbed within Japan
itself. and the steel and car
industries In particular
have increasingly
and overwhelmingly de-
pendent on export.

Japan now exports about
hair of Its autonwblles and
about one-third oi its steel.
and this has Inevitably be-
come the source oi severe
lriction over trade with
other cOuntries.

The problems ensuing
from the phenomenal in-
crease In Japan's economic
strength may be divided
between those involving the
industrially advanced na-
tions on the one hand. and
the Third World on the
other. This same distinction
is one that must be made
when considering Japan's
role in international society
as well.

Trade irictlm among the
industrially advanced na-
tions is now the locus oi
attention all over the world.
Just as did the US before
it. Japan now strongly ad-
vocates iree trade from its
standpoint as a strong cco-

cusation that it Is getting

This has led to the im-
pression In Japan that the

international . negotiations
are being conducted in this
manner. it brings to the
tore the question as to
whether such negotiations
might be reduced to mere
bargaining with no basis in
consistent principles or
restraints. To avoid this.
every effort must be made
to discuss tree trade in Its
specific. concrete contexts.
A new economic principle
must be identiﬁed that
takes into concrete consid-
eration all the various
problems we now conimnt
in order to achieve a bal-
ance in the world economy.

To what degree should
the principle or free trade
be modiﬁed? How should
industrial cooperation and
export restrictions be im-
plemented? It is these
questions to which the in-
dustrially adianced nations
must direct their elrorls at
achieving a consensus. in

Nishibe: It seems to me
that as intellectuals speak
out in Japan or abroad,
the! appear to be speaking
excessively in terms oi
their countries’ national
Interests. 0! course. no one
is ﬂee {ruin the ties to the
nation or society to which
he belouss. but 1 think
that ior intellectuals to
play a really useiui role.
they should tree tilemselves
as much as pouihie trorn
such identification. 1 would.
then-tore. like to speak up
without particularly identi-
tyina myseli with my own
country.

Just as the United Kim:-
riorn in the mid-19th cen-
tury. which saw itself as
the iuctory oi the world.
regarding all other nations
M either raw-materials
suppliers or customers {or
their country's products.
Japan today seams to have
become an ardent advocate
oi free trade. and I do oi
course appreciate the sev-
eral beneiits that accrue
i’rom such advocacy.

in order for all countries
to beneiit irom tree ex-
change and trade in a
truly voluntary iashion. it
seems to me that you need
conventional trust between
the countries concerned
Trade and other interna-
tional frictions. whether
you like it or not, do In-
evitabiy impair such trust
betu’een nations.

in order to demonstrate
the need for such mutual
understanding. 1 would like
to quote two illustrations.
One has to do with open-

which has been raised by

seems to be bypassing them.

In my own view. in order
to produce new rules ior

must consider the following
points.

First. I do ieel that we
need safeguard provisions
oi some sort. even ii only

However, becawc people

been able to produce any
viable answers. Therein lies
the problem.

One solution in my view
might be something along
the iollowing lines. We
might conclude an agree-
ment on some kind oi

chanism so that while saie-
guard provisions are being
applied to a certain coun-
try. we can examine the

to improve the efﬁciency oi

through such mutual sor-
veillanoe we conclude that
no eiiectlve adjustment is
indeed taking place. we can
then cancel the Invocation

[Test] thuis on Seniconductor/Ic

The ”-82 plant and equipment invest-ant schedules of major
electronics and coquter nsnufacturere demonstrate a con-
tinued offensive stance. The total coubined budget for
Hitachi, Ltd and five other firns is approximately 615 bil-
lion yen-a double digit (14-15 percent) increase over the
previous fiscal year smunt. the enlargement of the seni-
conductoriIc related field renains significant. In the con-
puter related category, an expansion and repletion plan in
keeping. with a quantitative increase is expected. In order
to effect increased production of peripherals and terainal
equipunt acconpsnying the erpsnaion of as related nach-
ines, the trsmfer of production itens to other plants and
factory "relay out" are expected.

Increased Production of 0A Terminals

Hitachi, Ltd will go to a loo-billion-yen budget in the ”-82 plant and equip-
Ient invest-ent schedule. The fire will directly invest in strategically in-
portant depart-ants. The expanded schedule calls for investment of half the
auunt quoted above (50 billion yen) in IC/electronics fields. Nippon Elec-
tric Conany, Ltd will put in 95 billion yen and tujitsu, Ltd. 75 billion yen.
The budgets of the three firs: together take up 65 percent of the six-firm in-
vest-ent schedule figure total.

Oki Blectric Very Bathusiastic About IC

In tom of plant and equip-ht invest-ant according to different categories,
OILi Bleetric's IC Depart-ant designation of slightly under 60 percent of the
total budget for the semiconductor/IO field is noteworthy. Other firm are
putting 30 to ‘0 percent of their respective budgets into this sector. As
in the previous fiscal year. the fins regard this category as the mat in-
portant.

Likewise, as a result of the 1.81 trend, the plant and equipment investment in
the computer category is more than ever shifting toward the magnetic disc,
printer and other peripheral and terminal equipnnt fields; and there is a
strong tendency to beef up the software department.

At Hitachi, of the “-82 budget of 82 billion yen, the electronics category
which includes IC was allotted 36.6 billion yen; and of this amunt, the 10
related field is expected to receive 28 billion yen. When we include the five
related firms in our consideration, the total IC related allocation comes to
36 billion yen.

lob-Billion-Yen Total for Affiliate Firms

Thirty-five billion yen are slated for the semi-conductor/IC category in I-‘Y-82.
and the scheduled size of the investmnt in this sector for the five affiliate
firms as well as Hitachi is slated to be a total of 66 billion yen.

In the commuter related category, the Kanagawa plant (99.000 square meters)
which manufactures mainframes, is operating at just about full capacity; thus.
its expansion must be considered. But the Odawara plant (75,000 square
meters), which deals in input/output equipment and outside memory facilities,
and the Asahi plant, which handles minicomputers and office computers, are
said to have some reserves, and there are no plans to expand these facilities.

10 Billion Yen for Couputer Category

Nippon Electric Cowany (NECI ”-82 budget was 85 billion yen. Of this amount.
the semiconductor/1C category captured nearly half (41 billion yen) the total
amount. Its computer allotment in the meantime has reached 10 billion yen.

‘lhis firm has transferred a segment of the Fuchu plant's magnetic disc section
and office computer production to the Iberagi Nichiden plant, which was com-
pleted toward the end of last year. It has started construction of a second-
ary-phase plant with the same dimnaiona as the first-phase plant and is work-
ing on a plan to make the forter into a mass production comuter factory.

In April 1982, ﬂiigata Nichiden, which has increased its production lines, will
start producing 0A Terminal 5200 Model 05, in addition to printer production.

'lhus, in the comuter related field, NBC's task allotment is as follows:
Puchu—mainfrane, miniconputer; Ibaragi—office computer, magnetic disc;
hiigatam-printer, 0A terminal; Tohoku Nichiden—printer, crossbar switchboard;
Shizuoks—printer, FAX.

Rita, Sagamihara, and Hizo-no-guchi's electronic switchboard, PBX are slated to
be transferred to the Gamsgo plant, scheduled for completion in October. The
communications/computer related production format will be expanded and strength-
ened significantly. The ”-82 budget of 95 billion yen, too, will have m as
its focal center.

Totebayaahi Plant's Construction To Start

Fujitsu's “-82 budget to 59 billion yen will have an IC related allocation of
33-36 billion yen. In the case of this firm, the expansion of the 0A, per-
ipheral and terminal facility sections is noteworthy. It will begin construc-
tion of the Kanbayashi plant with a view to making it an OA factory. 1111s is
due to the fact that the Hinami-‘Iama plant—which is producing the Japanese
HP, financial terminal, printer-has reached its maximum production capacity.
The magnetic equipment will be transferred to theKumatani plant (13,000
square meters) scheduled for completion in june. It is examining the pos-
sibility of establishing magnetic, equipment production at the Yamagata plant
and a personal computer related equipment factory at the Yamagata plant and a

personal computer related equipment factory at the Hiyagi plant within the
yeare

After the transfer of its H-series production to Numaru, the Nagano plant is
now the production base for the V-aeries, print baaeboards and magnetic disc
related parts.

Expansion of Software Developnnt

Mitsubishi Electric Corporation's ”-82 budget was 65 billion yen, whereas for
“-82, an allocation of about 50 billion yen is predicted. As in FY-81 (elec-
tronics related allocation--23 billion yen), half this amount is expected to
be invested in the electronics category.

In the computer related field, the firm poured 2 billion yen into the Kaaakura
computer manufacturing plant in 1981 in order to build a 10,000-squarc-mater
building. In addition, it is enlarging the software development section and
is expanding the peripherals and terminals as well as pathologic comuter
production lines.

Toshiba's “-81 budget was 67 billion yen. In 1982, it plans to effect a 6-
percent increase of the construction base. During “-81. it expended 22 bil-
lion yen in the semiconductor/electronics parts field (20 billion yen in IC
alone) and 8.6 billion yen for the 0A, computer related categories. This
amount is slated for expansion of the Hino plant (FAX) and construction of a
new peripherals factory in Gene.

Personal Couputer Production To Be Strengthened

As shown above, the main thrust of plant and equipment investment is the Ic
section; but in the comuter related field, it is expected that the ”-82
plant and equipment investment schedule will continue to uphold the emphasis
shift to the expansion of personal cmuter, 0A equipment, peripherals and
terninals.

[Article by Yasunobu Otori. science commentator: "New World Unfolded by the
Application of Ceramics"]

[Excerpts] Late last year an automobile powered by the world's first ceramic
diesel engine was tested at the Ceramics Consolidated Research Laboratory of
Kyoto Ceramics located at Kokubu city, Kagoshima Prefecture, and caught the
attention of the world.

Speaking of ceramics, they are not the ordinary kind of ceramics. They are
the fine ceramics (PC) which were developed very rapidly in recent years and
are known for their superior heat resistance, wear resistance and mechanical
strength. The cylinder as well as the piston of this engine were made of PC.
Ceramic development and engine design were started severslyears ago by Kyoto
Ceramics with the cooperation of Isuzu Motors. This engine, which has three
cylinders and a capacity of 2,000 cc, is of practical size.

Although the people of Kyoto Ceramics modestly stated that "He just proved it
could be done with today's technology," it was no less than a precursor of the
"ceramic engine revolution" which may fundamentally change the present low
thermal efficiency metal engine.

An Engine Which Does Not Need Cooling

Although still in the experimental stage, its epoch-making character is quite
evident from the three cylinders which stand erect like short chimneys. The
conventional metal engine has cylinders surrounded by the water cooling system
so the cylinders are invisible, and there are also many attachments includirz
a radiator.

The ceramic engine has none of these because it does not need cooling. Natur-
ally, the gas temperature inside the cylinder will be much higher and thermal
efficiency will be improved. About 30 percent of the heat which would other-
wise be lost through the cooling water can be saved. If energy in the high-
temperature exhaust gas is recovered by means of a turbocharger or something
else, engine efficiency can be raised 15-20 percent over that of a metal
engine.

Reduction in weight due to the elimination of the cooling system superimposed
on the reduction in weight due to small size and .light weight afforded by an
improved efficiency have a secondary effect on the improvement of efficiency.
Starting from the revolution of the engine, the revolution of autmbiles will

take a new turn. The leading role in this revolution is played by none other
than the Pc itself.

Ceramics That Can Hithstand High Temperature

Now then, how do people of Kyoto Ceramics who have successfully made a trial
run of an PC engine appraise it and what course of action will they take con-
cerning its practical application?

"In the field of electronic ceramics production, Japan takes pride in its
world dominant position in advanced technology, as well as in the actual re-
sults of its application. The outstanding features of PC include high
strength at high temperatures for which metals parts are useless. so PC can
be utilized for manufacturing parts exposed to high temperature and severe
mechanical conditions such as an automobile engine," said Kazuo Inamori,
president of Kyoto Ceramics. He continued, saying: "Hetels are not only
susceptible to oxidation at high temperature, but also the best heat-resistant
alloy with superior high temperature strength begins to lose its strength at
approximately 600°C and becomes soft and malleable. They can hardly support
any load at a temperature greater than 1.ooo°c.

"Ceramics are not easily oxidized and there are also some materials which will
not soften at all at a temperature as high as 1,500'6, at which most metals
would melt. Therefore, if an engine that does not need cooling can be made
from ceranics, a revolutionary increase in thermal efficiency can be achieved
(heat loss through the cooling medium accounts for 30 percent of all heat
losses).

"However, engine parts are subjected to severe and repeated stresses. There-
fore, if the parts (including cylinders and pistons) made of hard and brittle
materials such as ceramics were to be used in mass produced engines, an
extraordinary effort would have to be made to insure their reliability.

"Nondestructive inspection technology applicable to the parts with compli-
cated shapes, such as pistons and rotors made of ceramic, has not yet been
established. Therefore, there is urgent need to develop an inspection tech-
nology of sufficiently high accuracy which is also applicable to the manage-
ment of a mass-production process in the future.

"The problems that lust be solved by ceramics makers include, for example,
increasing the strength of the products which are mass-produced; minimising
the variation in the quality; and manufacturing than efficiently in desired
shapes and sizes with the necessary accuracy.

"As to the means of increasing strength, in addition to strict quality con-
trol during the manufacturing process, strengthening thrOugh special pro-
cesses can also be considered.

"As to machining precision, only diamond tools can be used for machin1ng Fc
products because of their hardness. However, because of this hardness. sur-
face slack and elastic deformation during the machining process will be reducel
FC products therefore ought to be manufactured to high machining precision

with efficiency if the appropriate tools and cutting conditions are used."

Target items for development considered by Kyoto Ceramics include the follows
ing: automotive diesel engines, gas turbines used in power generation, rotors,
ball bearings, and such important parts as spindles used on ultrapreeision
machine-tools, tubes used in high temperature heat exchanger, and the interior
walls of a nuclear fusion furnace (to withstand a temperature as high as
l.800°c). These are all related to the use of PC to improve energy conserva-
tion, heat-resistance and durability.

The importance of developing an automotive diesel engine (2,000 cc class) using
PC of the silicion nitride family, the favorite of all ceramics, was recognized
by MITI, and an important technology development subsidy amounting to 120 mil-
lion yen was given 3 years ago to Kyoto Ceramics. The trial production of an
FC engine has been completed. Based on the achievements of the past 3 years'
development, a 6-year plan consisting of second-stage applications research
activities was launched in 1981.

At the same time. with the cooperation of Isuzu Motors, Kyoto Ceramics will
continue research on the improvement of engine design, the development of pro-
duction technology and measures to bring down costs.

That is, during the next 4 years. the quality of PC will be further improved;
an engine capable of fully utilizing the best features of PC will be designed
and developed, the number of parts will be reduced significantly to achieve
the reduction in weight, the reduction in size, energy savings and the low
costs so that an PC engine may become practical. This engine is expected to
be a four-cylinder, 2,000 cc one.

Toyota and Nissan Hill Also Tackle the Problem

Although Kyoto Ceramics was the first to conduct a trial run with an EC engine,
it was not the first to undertake the development of an PC engine.

For example, Toyota's Central Research Laboratory 17 years ago in 1965 began
its research activities with the conviction that ceramics was the only material
satisfactory for the future engine.

They have developed their own PC of silicion nitride family sintered at 1.750’C
and found that its strength at 1,200°C was 100 kg/mmz. The fact that this
ceramic was manufactured under normal pressure was judged a favorable condition
for the mass-production of the engine.

As to the prospect of engine development, a trial car with a diesel engine will
be produced by 1985 and practical application will be realized in the 1980's.
An experimental car as well as a practical car powered by gas turbine will be
delayed until the 1990's.

0n the other hand, at the Nissan Motors Central Research Laboratory, work on
PC engine parts is also underway. They consider it quite possible to run an
experimental PC car by 1985, but when it comes to mess-production of these
engines. they feel that there are still many problems. Practical application
of an PC gas turbine. still in an unknown domain, is also considered an event
for the 1990's or later.

Toshiba, one of the PC material makers, has successfully synthesised a silicon
nitride powder of high quality. The ultrafine particles of this powder have
an average diameter in the range of 0.5-1 micron and excellent sintering
properties. PC made of this powder are said to have the strength of 126 kg/mm2
at 1,200 C.

With the cooperation ofan automaker, Toshiba is expected to produce a practical
PC diesel engine by the latter half of the 1980's.

But what's going on overseas? In Best Germany, Daimler Ben: is quite active.
They have been doing the R50 of a PC diesel engine and made public last year
a gas turbine passenger car, "Auto 2000," which uses an PC rotor.

Fuel consumption has come close to a practical level. but the technology to
mass produce PC parts has not yet been developed. They have recorded the Ope-
ration of an PC rotor at 60,000 RPM at 1,250’0.

Volkswagen, too, is exerting efforts to develop PC engine parts. Porsche has
not tackled the problem in earnest yet. but is expected to have a share of the
ceramic engine in a long run. BMW considers that it will take a longer period
to realize mass production of ceramic engines, definitely not within the next
10 years.

HITI Too Takes Action

HITI also recognized and attached importance to Japan's tardiness in this
field. It took positive action to include PC, starting in 1981, as part of

the ”R60 system of basic technologies for the industry of the next generation."
and to cultivate and strengthen PC research.

In the wake ofthe "PC round-table conference" organized in late 1980 by the
Advanced Machine Tool Technology Promotion Society and nine firms, including
Kyoto Ceramics and Toshiba, an "PC Technology Research Association” was
organized last August under the auspices of “III with the following 15 firms
joining the association: Kyoto Ceramics, Toshiba. NCK Insulators, NCK Spark
Plug, Shows Denko, Sumitomo Electric Industries, the Electro Chemical Indus-
trial Co., Shinagawa Pire Brick, Kurosaki Yogyo, Kobe Steel. Inoue Japax
Laboratory, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Toyota Machine Hbrks and
Toyota Motors.

This project is allocated a budget of 13 billion yen for 10 years. It is
centered or entrusting development to companies and adopts a competitive
development format. Its aim is to catch up with and surpass the level of
the United States. With enterprises such as Kyoto Ceramics, which has been

40
F(”l(lﬂﬂ(]Al.USIZ€NVLY
exporting stationary blade parts used on PC turbines to GM and Ford for 2 years,
as an association member, they expect to be able to catch up with the United
States in engines within 5-6 years.

Stirling Engine That Hill Shoulder the Next Generation

In Japan. the development of an automotive stirling engine (SE) is being under-
taken not only by automakers such as Toyota and Nissan but has also been under-
taken by the Institute for Technical Research in Machinery and the Agency for
Industrial Science and Technology in the area of basic research for the past 5
years.

This institute recently constructed an experimental SE (HELSE II) and obtained
1.88 horsepower of output with an average operating gas pressure of 33 atmo-
spheres. The operating gas was helium and the shaft speed was soo-1,soo RPM.
Although the output in power was less than expected, they were satisfied with
the fact that a foothold for the future progress had been secured.

High Energy Utilization Rate

Japan's interest in SE leads the world because SE can provide Japan with
marine engines for which high efficiency is of the utmost importance from a
consideration of the fuel consumption during a voyage, having ample margin in
the engine installation as well as a favorable specific output. The Transpor-
tation Technology Council. which is an advisory organ to the minister of
transport, in July 1975 gave a go-ahead for the development of SE. with the
cooperation of the Institute for Technical Research of Ships and the Japan
Naval Architectural Research Association, the Ministry of Transport entrusted
the tasks to the following three firms: Daihatsu Diesel, Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, and Nippon Piston Ring, and had them develop a domestic marine SE
by 1980.

Since there are many ships in the 1,000-ton class, goals for development were
set up with these ships in mind: output horsepower: 800; speed: 720 RPM; fuel:
heavy oil; working medium: helium or hydrogen; and efficiency: 36-40 percent.

As a result of this undertaking, a new sealing technology to prevent gas

leaks was developed by Nippon Piston Ring. The targeted SE was actually trial
manufactured and tested by Daihatsu Diesel. Although the expected output was
not achieved, the test confirmed that the development goals set at the begin-
ning were all achievable.

The expectation of the energy industry circles about the SE is also very big.
Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas are taking upon themselves the tasks of developing SE

with the cooperation of Aisin Seiki Co and Mr Yoshihiro Ishizaki, ex-lecturer,
Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo University. Tokyo Gas made a small-scale SE for
power generation on an experimental basis several years ago. The idea was to
generate power by each individual household with the exhaust heat to be used
for spaze heating and hot water heating. Economy and no noise were the

attractive features of SE. Aisin Seiki is currently engaged in the developlent
of an S! with 50 kw output.

Mitsubishi Electric too appraises highly the SE which is characterized by low
noise, no pollution, high efficiency and lultiple fuels. According to their
estimate, a high efficiency systel having an energy utilisation rate of more
than 150 percent (the ratio between the energy obtained by air-conditioning
and hotwater and the total energy spent in the form of fuel and auxiliary
electric power) can be realised to for: a calbination between household air-
conditioning (both heating and cooling) and hot water heating which use a
heat pump powered by an 83. They are forging ahead with the development of a
household 82 with an sin to put it to practical use in 3 years.

The SE has thus progressed from the industrial application stage to the house-
hold application stage. ﬂowever, its develop-cut in Japan is still far behind
that of the United States and other countries. “111 has designated the devel-
opment of the 83 as a link in the Moonlight Project, and will invest 10 nillion
yen over a period of 6 years starting in 1982.

[Excerpts] Japanese Genetic Industry Aims for World Supreaacy
First Year of Practical Application of Genetic Engineering

"Prom spring through summer of last year. there was a sense of a big boom
in genetic engineering. but it was due to the presulptuous mass media and
its overplaying. The real practical application actually starts this
spring. So 1982 is the first year in the practical application of genetic
engineering."

A research staff of a certain think tank stated this decisively while
chiding the mass media.

Naturally. there is sons foundation for the statement.

The guidelines (recombinant DNA experiment guidelines) were established in
Japan in 1979. In other words. it has been fully 3 years since the simul-
taneous start with "Ready, get set, go." It is finally taking off from
basic research and is now about to step into the second round of practical
application.

It has entered into a period of clinical trials of pharmaceuticals prs~
pared by genetic engineering.

The first trials began at the end of last year. Clinical trials of insulin
(effective drug for diabetes; distributed by Shionogi Seiyaku) prepared
using E. coli are being conducted by Professor A. Ebihara of the Jiji

Idai [Medical College] and others.

Next. at about the time this magazine is published. clinical trials on a
growth hormone (drug specific for duarfisn; distributed by Sunitomo Chemi-
cal) prepared by the same technique as above will have been started by
Professor K. shizume and others of the Tokyo Women's Medical College.

And. the third bullet! Interferon (believed to be a specific drug for
cancer and viral diseases; distributed by Takeda Chenical). which has now
becone sylbolic of genetic engineering. will be added to the clinical
trials starting about Harch. Thus. there will actually be opening fire
in the "war of new genetic engineering drugs."

however. the new drugs of these three firms are all inported from European
and American countries. '

Compared to the United States. which is leading. the level of Japanese
genetic engineering is said to be 6 to 5 years behind.

However. the recent genetic engineering fever in Japanese industrial cir-
cles is something to behold. One and a half years ago. when I began
reporting on the subject. the nutter of firms participating in genetic
engineering research was only a little less than 20. Now the number
easily exceeds 100. and the fact that it appears that "no firms can be
successful without genetic engineering" calls for nothing less than snare-
sent.

Just to mention a few. they include Sapporo Breweries. Aaahi Breweries.
Nippon Oil Co. Snow Brand Hill: Products. Calpis Food. Mitsubishi Petro-
chemical. Nippon Paint. Chisso Corp. ‘l'eijin. Asahi Chemical. Jujo Paper.
etc. Among them are a fair nudaer of firms that seemingly have no connec-
tion with genes or biology whatsoever.

There is an enormous nuwer of firms venturing into the field of pharma-
ceuticals using biotechnology (biological wgineering as a whole. including
genetic engineering) as the lever. According to the results of a ques-
tionnaire survey conducted by Nihon Keiesi Shiﬂaunshs last year concerning
”plans for business in biotechnology." ’04 percent of the 95 firms having
such plans replied that pharmaceuticals was the target.

Among them. the scat remarkable transformation is found in textile menu-
facturers and petrochemical manufacturers. In both cases. they are betting
the coepanies' fortunes to get out of textiles and petrochemicals which are
at the bottom of the structurally depressed industries. We can mderstand
that mch. However. what will happen when most of the enterprises

venture into pharmaceuticals in a similar fashion?

Projects in Developmt Are Top Secret

Sumitono Cheeical is the major chemicals manufacturer next to Mitsubishi
Chemical. and it is already vying for the first and second positions in
synthetic pharmaceutical technology. Although it was slow to start. it
says the biotechnology structure is finally in order.

”To be honest. we were weak in the fermentation field. and to cultivate
that technology. we imported interferon cell culture technology from

Hellcome 00 (British). He also intend to produce antibiotics ahead of
others. He will conpete in the future with antibiotics. interferon and

(do

later with genetic engineering drugs. He would like sonehow to bring the
level up to that of the exclusive drug manufacturers.

"A long-term plan is to reduce the widely used petrochemical products as
mch as possible and to steer toward leading technology using genetic
engineering along with other biotechnology and highly functional sub-
stances as the backbone. However. we still produce aluminum. which is a
big job. But then. we didn‘t have to think about all this before the oil
shoek...." (Sumitomo Chemical)

Asahi Chemical. which is now nore fit to be called an "everything manu-
facturer" rather than a synthetic fibers enterprise. built and staffed a
P3 experimental laboratory last October at the teclmical research'and
development laboratory in Fuji (their central laboratory. with a staff
of 250).

"He had fermentation and synthesis technology. and it was a natural con-
sequence to go into genetic engineering. For the time being, we are
advancing the technological power aiming at pharmaceuticals and agricul-
tural chemicals in 5 years. In the 21st century, chemical plants will
probably be replaced by biological plants. and the cultivated technology
will then become useful." (Asahi Chemical)

A chemical nnufacturer. Showa Denko. says it has set its sights on drugs
for the circulatory system anong the pharmaceuticals. "Because of the broad
area of biotechnology. the means to narrow the aim is a cardinal point.
Otherwise. it will only eat up money without bearing fruit.

"Only in Japan are exclusive drug manufacturers developing pharmaceuticals.
In Heat Germany and the United States. it is done mostly by chemical amn-
facturers. The development of large-scale pharmaceuticals is growing
teclmically more sophisticated each year. and it is getting to be difficult
without the force of a general chemical manufacturer.” (Shows Denko)

While reporting on these firms, one headache that I encountered every-
where was a scene that was equally irritating. It was met when I asked
the question: "What sort of genetic engineering projects are you engaged
in?"

People who had been talkative until then become admirably close-mouthed
after that.

A certain research staff meaber explained apologetically:

"It is estimated that the 'tine and expense' required for a new drug to
appear on the market is '10 years and 3 billion yen.‘ Moreover, the suc-
cess rate of development is 'one in a thousand.‘ and even with those brought
to clinical trials, the ratio is 'one in ten.‘ You see how difficult it

is. Therefore. the development of a new drug is a top corporate secret.
The bigger the scale. the more conpletely we must prevent the leakage of
information."

A development manager of another pharmaceutical manufacturer added to the
above statement. saying:

"This is particularly true with genetic engineering. when this technique
is used. I can go so far as to say limitless lass production is possible.
Therefore. if you get there first. one firm can conquer the world narket.

As a latter of fact. 10 grams of growth hormone is enough for the entire
world. Moreover. the cost is absurdly low. This is attractive. Conse-
quently. a firm will never say what its targets are."

Depending on the enterprise. some firms will refuse to disclose not only
the number of research staff or R a D expenditure. but even the location of
the research laboratory.

A publicity section chief of a food product firm who said "reporting on
a research staff is out all the way." explained:

”For our company. biotechnology is a business of life and death in the
future. Even if we publicly annomced the slightest part of our research
structure. it would reveal roughly what we are doing and on what scale.
Even if the research staff talks cautiously. one can guess the substance
from a slip of the tongue now and then. Please excuse us."

I felt indeed that I was getting a glimpse of a frightening world as in a
spy novel.

At any rate. although we don't know what they are doing such at all. the
f 1m venturing into the pharmaceutical area using biotechnology as a
lever are many indeed.

Strategies of Suntory and Yakuruto

The first to call out was an unknown. middle-of-the-road phamceutical

manufacturer. wakinan Yakuhin. It succeeded in the synthesis of secretin.
a drug specific for gastroduodenal ulcers.

It was Suntory that competed with Hakinaga for the first. the synthesis of
secretin.

It succeeded in manufacturing alpha-neoendorphin. an analgesic resembling
morphine. using E. coli and yeast.

Suntory produced the result within only a year after the start of research
and development. The secret? runaging director ‘1'. Noguchi said non-
chalantly:

"Because we started at the tail end of the new drug war. we gathered
researchers who were at the foremost level in the world. Therefore.

the world's top technology came in smoothly. In addition. since a system
has been established beginning with a project setup. design and prepara-
tion. sonsthing is produced in an average of 3 to lo mths. I am strict.

106
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
and I give strict orders for cowletion by a certain date. Research and
development is systematic engineering. It is no good even if s certain
portion or a certain person is outstanding unless the overall level moves
in accord. The key is whether or not the research organ noves smoothly
like a hunsn body."

It was also unexpected when Yskuruto appeared with an snzyne called
staphylokinase that lyses throsbi that can cause cerebral throﬂosis or
myocardial infarction.

Although there are 90 research and SO assistant research staff medaers at
the central research laboratory in Kunitachi. Tokyo. the genetic engineer-
ing group has only a staff of S, counted with 18 at ﬂakinaga and 33 at
Suntroy. The Yakuruto research staff has proven physically that research
in genetic engineering can be cometitive even with a small staff.

The nanaging director in charge of the central research laboratory. Y.
Sumihsra, cited the company's background as its driving force.

"He were familiar with the techniques of handling nicroorganisms such as
lactobacillus and bifidobacterium as well as enzymic reactions (we first
developed an enzyme that strips plant cells). in the course of elucidating
their functions medically, the way to new drug developnent opened up."

In other words. he is saying that genetic engineering existed in the
course of development of the nicrobiological (fermentation) industry and
enzyme industry. This was the same in the case of Suntory.

In fact. this is the very reason that Japanese firms having potential in
the traditional fermentation industry of bean paste. soy sauce. fermented
beans, rice wine. etc. . are looked on as a threat by European and American
f irns although they are lagging behind in genetic engineering.

The rason is that even though a substance is produced by freely using
genetic engineering with E. coli. the bacteria must be cultured in a tank
in the final industrial step. and the knowhow of the fermentation industry
is useful then.

Conversely. this is the reason why fermentation businesses all joined in
genetic engineering.

In addition, a research staff member at the central research laboratory.

N. Sakurai. pointed out the importance of a "genetic engineering strategy."
"The problem is what to produce. The pharmaceutical field is very diffi-
cult since msny firms are competing. One may say interferon is good. but
there is no room to get in any longer. One cannot compete without due con-
sideration for these matters. and one must look for sonething unique.

"Then. we had the idea to extract something from a group of pathogenic
bacteria. Although pathogenic bacteria produce toxins. they also have
good properties as well. One needs to extract only the good properties
by using gene splicing."

Appearance of "Star Performer" Mitsubishi Chemical

Now. will these domestic products actually be successful as a medicine?
"There is a good possibility if the deund for secretin grows in the future."
(Hakinaga) "It may reach the reagent level for basic research. but drug
preparation must be carefully considered." (Suntory) "More research is
necessary." (Yakuruto) Thus. none of then shows such enthusiasm.

Judging from the fact that Hakinaga and Suntory among the above three firms
do not try to hide the fact that "the prospective winner among new drugs

is interferon." we may consider that the three substances they succeeded

in producing are "small grains" as drugs.

However small they may be. it is still simificant that the genetic
engineering began trotting prior to its jump into practical application
with a target within only a few years.

Furthermore. a motion to accelerate that trotting has developed at this
stage. It is said that the intense silence of the star enterprise which
has been maintained until now will be finally broken this spring.

The first to start the fire is likely to be Mitsubishi Chemical, which is
dubbed the bioindustry's number one blue chip. The president declared:
"He shall announce our achievements by spring."

No years ago. the director of the Life Science Research Institute was
switched from an academic. P. Bgami. to industrialist.M. Niwa. in an
attempt to convert the previous ivory tower to a practical tower. It
seems that that effort has borne fruit all at once.

Kikkoman. which went into life science earlier than Mitsubishi Chemical. has
also stated confidently: "He will announce our research results at the
International Congress on Industrial Microbiology and Genetics in June

and ask for a judgment on the true value of our company."

Kikkonan has the Mods Sangyo Science Laboratory and the central research
laboratory. and the research staff in genetic engineering numbers 50. It
has a long history of enzyme research and has developed an enzyme
(pectoliase [phonetic] Y23) to strip the cell wall for plant cell fusion
for the first time. This is the only enzyme in the world that is appli-
cable for gramineae and leguminosae plants. and it is speculated that it
will become a weapon in the seedling industry which has a future prospect.
ln genetic engineering. it has been conducting sufficient basic research.
as in the case of the Mitsubishi Chemical Life Science Research Laboratory.
and it has been the focus of attention.

According to an informed source in the stock exchange. it appears that
announcements are forthcoming from Kyowa Makko. which has the top-level
fermentation technology in the world. and Meiji Seika. which is the leading
antibiotics manufacturer. He expressed these movements by stating that
"Last year was the curtainraiaer. and this year the star performers will
finally appear.”

Japanese Firms Were Slow To Start

The present lag in Japan was naturally caused at the beginning. Was Japan
an "isolated island of information" cut off from the rest of the world at
the time?" Of course not.

The first to pay attention to this innovative technique in Japanese indus-
try was H. Niwa (currently the director of the Life Science Research
Institute). who was then director of the general research institute

of Mitsubishi Chemical. Niwa recalls:

"As I was perusing literature and reports at that time. the possibility of
chemically manipulating genes began to be discussed excitedly. I thought
if that became a reality. it would cause ripple effects in various areas
and it would be necessary to start following the reports."

Niwa graduated from the Faculty of Science. Tokyo University. Since
joining the firs. he has been engaged in the research and development of
industrial catalysts throughout. Thus. he is one of those who observed
the history of Japanese high growth fron its core through the progress in
catalysts-growth of the chemical industry-and Japan's development. At
the time. because of his position as director. he was studying broad areas
of research in general and he stuabled on genes.

What is gene splicing? What technology is required for it? What impact
does that technology have on the chemical industry? Wishing to solve these
questions that cane up one after another at the earliest possible tine. he
ordered his subordinates to begin investigation inediately.

Niwa was attracted by the fact that the possibility of manufacturing
various new drugs was being hinted at on one side. and the appearance of
a "dream industry" that would change the existing chemical industry alto-
gether was being talked about as if it were a story in a dream.

However. the working personnel denied the possibility of application.
stating: "It is technically too difficult for us to handle."

In addition to technical difficulty. what held Niwa back from starting
research was the talk of risk that this technooogy might produce a
Frankenstein. The investigation began to tail off.

In this respect. the major pharmaceutical manufacturer. Takeda Chemical
Industries. also followed a similar track.

The director of the Biological Research Institute. Y. Sugino. had been
analyzing viral carcinogenic genes. and in that respect. he had been
working on the preliminary step to gene splicing as a natural course

from early on. About that time, he had the opportunity to attend an inter-
national conference in the United States. His amazement was apparent.

"I felt that the tine difference between the research of Japan and that of
the United States was great. although jets are flying back and forth. In

109
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

Japan. we were thinking that research in gene splicing had just been set
afire there. but the fire was in fact burning with a big flame."

As soon as he returned. Sugino hurried with the technical research. Anong
the Japanese firms. his was the first to introduce the technique.

However. as in the case of Mitsubishi Chalical. the "shadowy part" of
gene splicing slowed down their steps. Sugino stated the following with
a strained smile.

"The Japanese are a farming race after all. Our nature is to plant one's
own crop after finding out what one's neighbor's crop is. So. there won't
be a Swanson in Japan even now. He have no Inn of anbition who heads for
a gold rush with a burden of risk. As a consequence. we inevitably take
the secondary means as a natural course."

These manufacturers representing the Japanese chemical industry and
pharmaceuticals both saw the dawn of genetic engineering. yet merely
stood looking at the situation. One may say that it symbolizes the behav-
ioral node of Japanese enterprises toward research and development.

The tine when Japanese firms finally began to take action cane only after
the American venture businesses had raised their flags (1977).

Dream Industry of 8 Trillion Yen

On 13 Novesber 1980. NIKON KEIZAI snmum carried an exclusive article
reporting that "using genetic engineering. Ajinomoto has succeeded in
producing a pure amino acid for the first time in the world."

Aj inomoto is the world's biggest general amino acid manufacturer. which
industrialized ”the taste of kelp" 70 years ago for the first time in the
world. It was reported at one time by the British BOONOHIST as monopo-
lizing the world market in amino acids ($1.7 billion) along with its rival.
Kyowa Hakko.

Its success was epoch-making in the following two aspects.

One aspect is that the application of the food industry made its way for
the first time into the field of genetic engineering. which had been the
focus of pharmaceuticals alone up to that time. Another aspect is that it
opened the way for application in general nnufacturing of "kilogram units"
from the level of "milligram unit" "mass production" as in insulin and
interferon. Without making a display of its novelty by manufacturing new
products. it concentrated on furthering the technical innovation of its

specialty.

Cone to think of it, the chief of the Life Science Laboratory of Mitsubishi
Chemical. H. Yanatani. said some time ago:

"Practical application of genetic engineering actually can be achieved the
quickest in the chemical industry. I would expect the first products to

50
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

appear within several years. Moreover. this will be more advantageous for
enterprises than anything else."

I considered the statement surprising at the time. However. I can now see
convincing elements.

New drugs are difficult to pull through after clinical trials begin; it

is said that approximately 7 years are required before they appear as
products. Moreover, being a new drug prepared by gene splicing for the
first time in history, the National Council of Pharmacy must inevitably
act with caution. Consequently. the first new drug by genetic engineering
is expected to appear only after 1985 any way you look at it.

On the other hand. when introducing this technique in the production
process. stringent investigations or procedures such as those required for
pharmaceuticals are not necessary. In addition, the modification of
bacteria to obtain increased yields of existing substances. and not to
create some new substances, is an extension of creating modified strains
by radiation or ultraviolet rays, and this is said to be the most advan-
tageous use of genetic engineering.

Yamatani also stated:

"Actually. in the United States, construction has begun of an alcohol
fermentation plant using microorganisms created by recombinant DNA."

The imensity of the application in the chemical industry finally became
evident when I heard the figure for the market forecast for genetic engi-
neering industry from the manager of the technical departsent of Mitsui a
C0. K. Kawashima:

"There are various surveys as to how big a market genetic engineering will
grow to in the future, and no straightforward answer exists. However, the
figures thought to be the most realistic among them are growth figures of
64 trillion yen in the world in 1990, and an 8-trillion-yen industry in
Japan. These figures exclude agricultural and food areas. Since the cur-
rent market scale of these areas is approximately 25 trillion yen. about
30 percent will be taken by genetic engineering.

The breakdown is 6 trillion yen for the chemical industry including the
fermentation industry. 500 billion yen for the amino acid industry, 500
billion yen for antibiotics, 1 trillion yen for proteins, and 200 to 300
trillion yen for hormones."

Mitsui (- Co had an eye on genetic engineering rather early for a trading
firm. It says it had contact with Swanson of Genentech. who is now a
flagbearer of genetic engineering. even before his fame.

why were they able to have such contact ahead of other firms?

"It is because Hitsui had a predisposition that enabled it to catch up
with leading technologies. Some 20 years ago, then President '1‘. Hinakami

SI.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

repeatedly said thatthe important factor for a future economic society to
achieve large growth was only technical innovation. Therefore. trading
firms should also have their antennas up at all times for the movement of
leading technologies and not merely move merchandise from left to right.

"Consequently. we are able to get to the heart of various firms. Informa-
tion from all over the world comes to me regarding what manufacturers are
aiming for what. He coordinate that information to successfully lake
transactions." (Kawashims)

The survey data cited by Kawashima above were selected accurately from among
the enormous amount of information by freely using the surveying power of
the trading firm, and they may be judged as having a fair amount of
reliability.

At any rate, a figure of 6 trillion yen for the chemical industry is
amazing. It is big enough to dim the market scale of pharmaceuticals.
which in itself is not small by any means.

Bullish Amino Acids. Chemical Industry Circle

Then. what is the "genetic engineering industry" or a "genetic engineering
plant" in which genetic engineering is applied to the chemical industry?
How revolutionary is it? Before discussing that, I shall touch on the cur-
rent stata of the amino acid industry. which may be regarded as having "the
bridging role" between the pharncautical and chemical industries.

Regarding the previously mentioned success of Ajinomoto, due to the fact
that "although the substance has good purity. its productivity is not high
enough to replace the conventional fermentation method." President K. Utada
is said to be urging the research group to "perfect the process in 3 or

4 years."

Why did Ajinomoto put that much effort into techncical innovation in the
amino acid industry?

"You will understand why if you look at the history of technical competi-
tion." said a journalist who is wall-informed in biotechnology.

”In 'nis world. unless you are making constant technical innovations. you
end up being left behind miserably as the retains of a previous era. like
American iron manufacturers. Ajinomoto understands that very well because
it has a history of such a bitter past experience."

In 1956. Kyowa Ilakko succeeded in the glutamic acid fermentation process
by using microorganisms for the first time in the world. and this shook
the "amino acid throne" of Ajinomoto. which it had maintained since the
Meiji era. This process has a productivity much greater than the con-
ventional process. It put Ajinomoto 2 years behind Kyowa Hakko in con-
verting to this fermentation process.

52
FOR OFFIGAL USE ONLY
Such things are not limited to the past. Inasmuch as the Japanese amino
acid industry has been breaking such unique ground that it is also called
the "amino acid culture." the competition has also been extremely severe.

In the past year also, technical innovations have appeared one after
another. The chemical manufacturers Shows Denko and Hitsui Toatsu Chemical
each developed a separate process to manufacture tryptophan (an amino acid.
feed additive) inexpensively.

"The triptophan process is a mixture of synthesis and fermentation. We
are also studying genetic engineering. Once the prospect for productivity
and cost by combining this method with other processes is assured. we will
switch any time." (H. Ito, new development promotion manager, Shows
Denko)

However, although increasing productivity may well be desirable, is there
any danger of repeating the same mistake as that of petroleum chemical
products through overproduction?

"In the past several years, amino acids have become popular even in
European and American countries. and we see a trend for shifting from a
vitamin era to an amino acid era. Once cost is lowered in the future, it
will probably spread even more in the world market. The future targets
are literally "health products" which are intermediate between pharma-
ceuticals and food, and the market is likely to expand with the health
industry boom." (Ajinomoto)

The amino acid industry is rather bullish.

It is said that even a larger scale bullish prospective wind than that of
the amino acid industry is blowing in the chemical industry. “hat in the
world is going on?

With a scornful look at petrochemicals, which are at the bottom of a slump
suffering from a serious blow triggered by the oil shock, leaders of
Mitsubishi Chemical and Toyo Rayon are boasting "the 21st century is indeed
the era of the chemical industry."

"You may think they are jesting out of desperation. But that's not so,"
explained an economic journalist I know.

A revolutiona"y change is now about to take place in the chemical industry
centered on biotechnology. Colossal size. concentration and high energy
consumption used to be the barometers for big enterprises and big coun-
tries. However. after the oil shock, the direction of flow changed com-
pletely. This time. a direction that is totally the reverse of the previous
trend has become the symbol for a major entity. Hiniaturization, dispersion,
energy-conservation and resource-conservation are the trends. That storm
has been blowing for a while. Very large-scale integrated (VLSIl cir-
cuits. microcomputers and automobiles are some examples. In the midst of
this. the chemical industry fell the farthest behind. However, that will

53

FOR OFHCIAL ESE 0ND

change all at once with hioreactors. With their appearance. the gigantic
plants will disappear. factories will become compact and the huge petro-
chemical complexes will gradually disappear from the Japanese archipelago
after 1990."

Certainly. when it happens. it will unmistakably be a revolution. And
that's the form the genetic engineering industry is taking. However. what
is a bioreactor that brings about such a revolution? What part of the
present structure of the chemical industry is changed by it. and how? In
order to know that. it is necessary to understand the existing processes
of the chemical industry.

For example. in the process of manufacturing ethylene oxide to be used as
material for typical synthetic fibers or surface activators in the petro-
chemical industry. the material ethylene gas and oxygen gas are aiml-
taneously fed into a catalytic layer. Metallic silver is used as a
catalyst to promote the oxidation reaction. But that alone does not induce
the reaction. The reaction begins when a high pressure of 20 atmospheres
is added by a compressor in the catalytic layer and this is simultaneously
heated to 300 degrees centigrade by a heater. Consequently. the equipment
is huge and gray pipes of all sizes form a jungle.

0n the other hand. in the human body or inside microorganisms. even more
sophisticated chemical reactions than those found in such a chemical indus-
try are constantly taking place under the relaxed conditions of normal
temperature and normal pressure. Why does a living body work so well?

The reason is none other than enzymes that mediate the biological reac-
tions.

Then, can't we use those enzymes in ordinary chemical reactions as well?
Anyone would arrive at such an idea. If the reactions of oxidation and
reduction were carried out using enzymes. then neither a huge compressor
nor a high-temperature reaction colurm would be necessary. Therefore,
the large amount of electricity required for the reaction would be unnec-
essary. Moreover. the facilities would not need to be made of heat-
resistant. pressure—resistant materials, which would naturally reduce
construction and equipment cost. 80. nothing but good would come of it.

Therefore. H171 also began to move last year. Hithin the 10-year plan

for next-generation basic industrial technology research and development

(31 billion yen for biotechnology). bioreactors were included along with
recombinant DNA. mass cell culture and cell fusion. To support it in the
private sector. 15 firms. including Mitsubishi Chemical. Sumitomo Cheni-
cal. Mitsui Toatsu. etc.. jointly established a "biotechnology development
technology research association." and a project through concerted govern-ent-
private effort has started.

HI‘l‘I roughly estimates that "once a full-scale bioreactor begins operation.
the equipment expenditure will be reduced to less than one-fifth. and the
energy cost will be less than half."

Now. you may question why we didn't start sooner to achieve something that
good.

In fact. prior to the appearance of petroleum chemistry. the chemical indus-
try had a period when it was producing petrochemical materials. ethanol.
butanol. propanol. etc.. with a simple version of a bioreactor (fermenta-
tion method) using microorganisms.

However. enzymes and microorganism also have weak points. Fatal ones at
that. First. the reaction is slow and productivity is low; and second.
since enzymes are water-soluble proteins. used as enzyme reactants. they
have to be discarded after each reaction; furthermore. since the reaction
products are mixed with impurities. their separation and purification
becomes difficult. There was a technical barrier.

"The prospect of breaking through that barrier was found in the two tech-
nologies of genetic mgineering and enzyme engineering." stated 8. Pukui.
a professor at Kyoto University and an authority in enzyme engineering.

"Recently. enzyme research has made rapid progress, and the structures

and functions of enzymes are understood fairly well. He understand what
kind of enzymes should be used in what way for industrial applications.

In addition to use those enzymes in continuous reactions. a technique to
immobilize them with resins in metallic catalysts (immobilized enzymes) or
a technique to inobilize microorganisms that produce enzymes (imobilized
microorganisms) are beginning to be used considerably in practical applica-
tions. 0n the other hand. genetic engineering is excellent for providing
enzymes with new functions or to modify microorganisms. Bioresctors have
become a reality as a result of these two technologies being introduced."

In December 1980. Cetus of the United States announced at an international
symposium in Israel the substance of bioreactor development for producing
ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (raw material for polyester. deter-
gents, cosmetics. etc.). and surprised the world.

Cetus was founded earlier than Genetech, which boasts being the "Sony

of genetic engineering." Being backed by major corporations such as
Standard Oil. National Distillers. chevron. etc.. Cetus had no interest in
pharmaceuticals but had been studying fixed targets in the chemical indus-
try and energy area from the beginning. and it is the biggest genetic
engineering venture business. While other venture businesses were raising
colorful advertising balloons. it remained silent and waited for the oppor-
tunity. "However. the Japanese firms need not fear Cetus." said the pre-
viously mentioned economic journalist.

In the area of bioreactors. Japanese firms appear to be lagging behind the
United States at a glance. However. Japan is ahead in inobilised enzymes
(microorganisms). The most advantageous aspect of the Japanese is that
they are skillful in copying. In fact. enzymes are substances that are

very easy to copy. Without hard work to discover new enzymes. it is said
that there are good possibilities that "sinilar enzynas" are found by
searching in the vicinity of good enzymes. Therefore. once they start to
run, the Japanese are likely to get there first.

Installation of a bioreactor is equivalent to placing robots in autonobile
or semiconductor factories. so to speak. and the faster the quality improve-
ment and productivity increase. the greater the possibility to conquer the
world market first.

A wave of robot use is now reaching even nedium and small enterprises in

Japan. In the future. a bioreactor whirlwind to replace robots will prob-
ably sweep over the land.

Even without the conment of this journalist. we see that industrial circles
will certainly be aflane toward 1990.

However. while industrial circles are racing all at once. I could not help
but feel that something is being forgotten. Hhat could that be?

After thinking about it for a while. I recalled what had been said by one
of the pioneering molecular biologists sons tine ago:

"Actually. the real significance in the application of genetic engineering
is in energy and food."

That professor also said that our enthusiasm to sharpen this leading
technology should be directed toward energy and food. which will benefit
mankind noat of all.

Needless to say. Japan is an energy-dependent country. It has discarded
the role of an agricultural nation.

However. genetic engineering research in energy and food areas is showing
only slow progress.... As I saw this reality. 1990 seenad dark....
