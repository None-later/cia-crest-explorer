[Text] A review is given of the status of theoretical and experimental work

in the area of microwave radiometric investigations of soil and subsoil. A
study is made of the physical principles of the interrelationship between
radiation characteristics and moisture content and a number of other geophysical
parameters of soil which is homogeneous and nonhomogeneous in terms of depth.

in the absence and presence of vegetation. An estimate is made of the feasi-
bility of determining moisture characteristics by microwave radiometry methods.

Introduction

A brief synopsis of the status of microwave radiometric investigations of soil
and subsoil under conditions of moistening was given in [1.2.51.52].

The ability to estimate the moisture characteristics of soil by microwave
radiometry methods is based on the dependence of the intensity. degree of
polarization and penetrating capacity of the electromagnetic radiation of soil
and subsoil on the dielectric properties of the latter, which are determined
by the amount of moisture content and features of its vertical distribution.

Microwave radiometric investigations of moistened soil and subsoil include the
following: studying the interrelationship between radiation characteristics
in the UHF and SH? range and key geophysical par1meters. such as the amount

of moisture content. the density and lithology of the subsoil, and a number

of other properties; determining the influence of the parameters of vertical
profiles of moisture and temperature on the characteristics of the microwave
radiation spectrum; obtaining estimates of the screening influence of vegeta-
tion covers; developing procedures for and estimating the accuracy of deter-
mining moisture characteristics in different hydrogeological situations.

Let us discuss the key results achieved in these areas.

1. Fundamental Radiation Relationships

501‘ contains solid particles, ground water and air. The solid particles
consist of mineral and organic matter. The major mass in the majority of

soil consists of mineral matter: Particles measuring more than 3 m in dia-
meter are the rocky component of the soil, particles from 0.01 to 1 mm.
“physical“ sand, and particles finer than 0.01 mm. “physical" clay. Subsoil
forming minerals consist chiefly of the oxides $102 and A1 03. The content

of organic matter varies within the range of from one to 10 percent of the
weight of the soil. The density of soil varies within the range of l to 2
g/cm3. and in the arable layer, as a rr‘e, from 1 to 1.5 glen3 [3,4]. Soil
moisture is non-identical with respect to its quality. The following cate-
gories of moisture are distinguished: securely bound, loosely bound. and
free. The quantity of bound water varies from one percent in sand to 20 per-
cent and more in some clay. In the majority of soil and subsoil this figure
does not exceed five percent. During moistening, swelling of the ground takes
place. For example, sand can change its volume by 30 percent with an increase
in moisture from zero to 30 percent. This process depends on the salinity of
the soil mixture and the presence of organic matter. Depending on the type

of soil, the nature of its treatment, and features of the relief of the
terrain. the ground surface is distinguished by the presence of irregularities,
the characteristic dimensions of which vary from fractions of a millimeter

and dozens of centimeters (fine-structure and gross-structure irregularities)
to dozens of meters and more (topographical features).

The dielectric characteristics of soil and subsoil are determined to a different
extent by the amount of moisture content. the density of the soil, features

of lithology. the concentration and composition of salts in the soil mixture,
and temperature.

The dielectric constant of dry ground, e' , depends on density [9,10]. Accord-
ing to data of measurements for aluminosilicate rocks. the following relation-
ship holds true:

ﬂ'=1+o.59.. (1)

where n represents density in g/cma. For ground consisting of sand and
clay. c' - 3 to a. and the loss tangent, tan 6 , equals 10‘2 to 10'3.

The dielectric constant of moistened soil and subsoil is estimated on the
basis of equations from the theory of multicomponent mixtures [11-15]. These
equations take into account the relative volume of components, their dielectric
parameters. and the shape of inclusion elements. But the majority of equations
from the theory of mixtures give highly approximate quantitative estimates of
the dielectric properties of moistened soil and subsoil.

In this connection, of decisive importance in studying the dependence of di-
electric properties on moisture are representative data from laboratory

measurements. for specimens of sandy and clayey soil with a density of about
1.75 g/cm3. made in the waveband from 0.8 to 226 cm [17]; for specimens of
loamy soil with a density of 1.2 to 1.8 g/cm3, made in the waveband from 7.5 cm
to 10 m [18]: for specimens of sandy. clayey and silty soil with a density of
1.2 to 1.7 g/cm3, made in the 1.15 to 300 cm waveband [19]; as well as the data
of other studies [20.26.30]. In fig 1 are represented data from these studies
for a 20 cm wave, presented in the form of the dependence of c' and c" on
the specific weight of moisture.*

l. v’ g/cm

The measurement data show an increase in the real and imaginary parts of c
with an increase in moisture content. The slight dependence of the dielectric
constant on the degree of moistening with low moisture values (approximately
five percent maximum) can be explained by the sorption capacity of soil when

a certain part of the moisture is securely bound by the surface of soil part-
icles.** With less than five percent of moisture the value of c' practically
does not depend on the wavelength.

*The specific weight of moisture, pv (g/cm3) , is the weight of water in a
unit volume of soil. The relative moisture content, m (I) . is defined as the
ratio of the weight of water to the weight of dry ground per unit volume of

soil.
"According to the limited data available. the baund water has an anomalously

low value of c' . equaling 1.06 to 2.2 [11].

According to the data of [17], sand and clay differ in absorption properties
in the range of waves longer than 3 cm: The absorbing capacity of clayey
soil is three- to fivefold greater than that of sandy soil. furthermore,

a considerable salt content has been observed in specimens of clayey soil.
But according to the data of [19]. no dependence of absorbing capacity on the
type of soil is observed. These results show that the extent of absorption
with waves longer than 3 cm depends not so much on the type of soil as on the
level of ionic conduction of the soil mixture.

A slight temperature dependence of the dielectric constant has been observed
with a moisture content greater than 10 )ercent-an increase in the real and
a lowering of the imaginary part of r [19].

An analysis of the applicability of the equations of the theory of mixtures
and certain numerical calculation results are contained in [5. 11-16]. The
criterion for the applicability of a specific equation for estimating the
dielectric properties of soil and subsoil is its taking into account features
of the relative distribution of solid and liquid phases of the mixture with
different moisture content values. and also the agreement of calculation re-
sults with measurement data. For example, in the case of dry ground a "part-
icle-air" mixture is close to a statistical type of component distribution.
For the purpose of estimating the value of c Odelevskiy's equation and
Likhteneker's logarithmic equation are applicable. With a moisture content
higher than a few percent the ground represents a three-phase matrix system
(water forms the matrix). It is possible, however, to disregard the presence
of one of the components (air) having the lowest value of c .

Comparison with the data from experiments [17-19] has shown satisfactory
agreement with them of the results of calculations by the following equations:

a) Odalevskiy's for matrix-type mixtures:

where c u . tv , and c are the dielectric constants of the mixture, water

Odelevskiy's equation with not too high values of the specific concentration

of water.*

 

*It is proven by expanding t into a series of powers of H .

Some calculation results are given in fig 1. Within the range of 0.05 5 p 5
5 0.35 g/cmv. the dependence of c' and c" of the soil on the moisture
content are close to linear with a slope constant of Ac/Ap ~ 0.7c . The
influence of the type of soil is manifested chiefly in thevfarm ofvan inverse
relationship between the dimensions of particles (degree of dispersion) and

the length of the range of moisture values in which 5 practically does

not depend on the moisture content. It has been shownaT1,2] that the density
of the soil represents a parameter of the dependence of the dielectric con-
stant on the degree of relative moisture content; at the same time the value

of the density has a slight influence on the nature and slope of the curve

for the dependence of the dielectric constant on the specific weight of moisture
in the soil.

The data of [18,19] confirm the theoretical conclusions to the effect that
the key parameter determining the value of c is the specific moisture con-
tent.*

In table 1 are given averaged calculated values. obtained at IRE AN SSSR

of the sensitivity of the emission strength to variations in soil parameters.

The results of experiments. laboratory [21.22]. stationary ground [6.26.36.57].
and from on board airplanes [6.23.26.27-30.36-39.56] and from 152's [artificial
ﬁarth satellites] (5.6.25,31.32.33.35.55.56.S9.60] in the 0.8 to 30 cm waveband
have confirmed the existence of a stable dependence of radiation characteris-
tics on the moisture content oi the surface layer. The quantitative values

of the slope of radiation versus moisture content curves found experimentally
are close to calculated estimates (fig 2). The differential in radio emission
levels of dry soil and soil in the state of its full moisture capacity in
vertical observation equals 60 to 90'K. Hith the most widespread density
values under field conditions. 1 to 1.5 g/cm3. the slope of the radiation versus
moisture content curve is about minus 1.5 to 2.5'K per percentage of moisture
content with 3 to 30 cm waves [26.36]. The curve for radioluminance versus
specific weight of moisture is characterized by a slope of about minus 0.15 to
0.2'K/g/dm3. agreeing with the calculated value. The influence of variations
in soil density is observed chiefly with small moisture content values.

Differences are observed in the slope of the radiation versus moisture content
curves for vertical and horizontal polarization with an increase in observation
angle. For example. according to data of measurements with 2.8 and 2l cm anes
[27.29]. with o a 40 to 45° the slope for vertical polarization is twofold
smaller than in observing at the nadir. The radiation polarization factor
increases with an increase in moisture content. The slope of the experimental
curVe has been shown. however. to be smaller than the calculated. which can be
explained by the influence of irregularities and by the vertical inhomogeneity
in moisture distribution. The radioluminance value correlates with the amount
of mois'urc content in a layer (0.l to l.0)l thick. No significant spectral
differences have been obserVed in the values of the slope of radiation versus
moisture content curves.

According to experimental data in (27.29.32). daily variations in temperature
of is to 30'C result in variations in radioluminance. reaching 10 to 25°K with
l to 5 cm waves and not exceeding 3 to S‘K with 20 to 30 cm waves.

In terms of its relationship to EMF. 5"? and UHF waves. the ground surface can
be represented as rough and locally smooth. The results of model estimates of
the influence of fine-structure irregularities according to the slight perturba-
tion method [2.40.45] have shown that the value of radiating power in the pre-
sence of slight perturbations.

(where A_ represents the albedo of the perturbed surface. AR is the degree
of reductfon of the specular component. R_ . and DJ is the dispersion of the
stray field). differs from the value of c_ = i - R_ for a flat surface by

no more than 0.01 to 0.02(3 to 6'K) in the observation angle range of 0 to
60'. Gross-structure irregularities. whose influence is taken into account

in the Kirchhoff approximation. result in considerable depolarization of the
radiation [2.65] and in a considerable increase in radioluminance of lO'K and
more. chiefly for horizontal polarization with glancing observation angles.
Features of the topography cause variations in the mean value of the brightness
temperature reaching lO'K for horizontal polarization with 6 1 40° and so .
- 20‘.

It has been confirmed experimentally [26] that the influence of surface irregu-
larltiea (tilled fields) is manifested chiefly with l to 3 cm waves. primar.ly
for horizontal polarization. in thc form of a reduction in the slope of radia-
tion versus moisture content curves.

The data obtained demonstrate the feasibility of determining moisture content
for as many as 10 gradations by the microwave radiometry method.“

 

zThe data-3f radiometric measurements make it possible to determine directly

the specific moisture content or moisture content as a percentage of total
moisture capacity. For comparison of the data of radiometric estimates with

the results of field measurements of relative moisture content. values of the
content of moisture by weight must be scaled to allow for the density of the soil.

The nature of the distribution of moisture content is determined by the type
of soil and subsoil. by the level of ground waters. and. in irrigated land.
by the irrigation and evaporation cycle: the amount of water poured on. the
irrigation period. and weather conditions.

For the purpose of determining the interrelationship between the effectiVe
values of the radiating power and temperature, ‘e and T . and parameters

of the moisture content profile, various model approximations are employed.
Real media are represented in the form of flat-layer structures with values

of I which are constant within the limits of each layer; in the form of
structures including layers with smooth regular and random variations in dielec-
tric properties; etc. Approximation functions are employed for the purpose of
describing profiles of moisture content (and of the dielectric constant) in
these models. Some of them are illustrated in fig 3b: a step function (I),

a linear (II). a broken-line (iii). an exponential polynomial (IV) and an
Epstein function (V) li.2.£l-69.53]. It has been shown [1.ﬁ2] that the radia-
tion contrast caused by the presence of inhomogeneity at depth t with a
profile of type i is determined by the approximate equation:

Axi=(I-R.u)'lfnne"". (13)

where r‘ - 1 i : R is the reflection coefficient at the upper limit; and

RI is the reflection coefficient for the inhomogeneity.

The existence of smooth transitions on r(z) exerts an adjusting effect. which
results in a reduction of reflections at the limits. According to [2,62,66,65].
reflection from smooth transition layers at the "upper layer - uniform half-
space" limit which are described by functions of type IV and V is considerable
only with a relative thickness of the layer equaling ill 1 0.1 to 0.3. Esti-
mates of the influence of a smooth transition layer at one of the limits of
model 1 (cf.. e.g.. model V) can be obtained in an impedance approximation:

for the transition layer a determination is made of the effective value of the
reflection coefficient. R. . reduced for the mean level of t . The values

of Ref and t are used in (13) to estimate the amount of radioluminance
contrast.

As follows form (13). the influence of the moisture content of the lower

layers can be felt when the depth at which they lie does not exceed the thick-
ness of the skin layer in the upper ground level.

The individual sounding depths with the values of c from [17] equal from
5 to 50 cm with 10 to 30 cm waves for clayey soil. and from 10 to 200 cm for

sandy soil. with a variation in the moisture content of the upper layer of
from four to 12 percent.

It has been shown [41,58] that the influence of vertical inhomogeneity in
((1) is felt chiefly with an increase in moisture content with depth.

The nature of the spectrum relationship of the radioluminance of vertically
polarized radiation when observing at angles close to the Brewster angle is
determined by the sign of the temperature profile gradient [58].

The analytical solution to the problem of reconstructing the moisture content
profile with the kernel of integral equation (12) is not known. Approximate
estimates of parameters of the profile can be gotten on the basis of the re-
lationship between the thickness of the skin layer and the moisture content
and the radiation'a wavelength.

For example. for the model of a two-layer medium (model I) a separate estimate
is made of the moisture content of the top and bottom layers. here the number
of differentiable gradations of moisture content in the bottom layer is several
times less thlL the number of differentiable gradations of moisture content in
the top layer.

Experiments conducted at IRE AN SSSR have revealed considerable radiation con-
trast with UK? waves. reaching 10 to JO'K and more with the ground water level
lying at depths of 30 to 70 cm.*

Spectrum measurements of the polarization factor have made it possible to obtain
estimates of parameters of the moisture content profile within the limits of
depths of i 3 1/2 [6].

In modeling the ground with profile 1 (fig 3b) the possibility has been demon-
strated of getting estimates of the moisture content of the top layer and of
its thickness by measuring radiation characteristics at several observation
angles [65].

In [53] for model [I (fig 3b) a technique has been developed for estimating
the moisture supply of the top layer of soil up to several decimeters thick
by determining the moisture content at the surface and utilizing data on the
slope of the moisture content profile. corresponding to values of the lowest

moisture capacity of the soil.

In [26]. for the purpose of estimating parameters of the profile. a technique
is suggested for tying in the value of the "equivalent moisture content" ob-
tained free radiometric estimates with the depth of the skin layer from the
data of measurements with different waves.

Changes in moisture content in the process of drying of the soil are accompanied
by changes in radioluminsnce (figs 7 and 8). In fig 7 is given an example of

a change in the intensity of the soil's radiation from the data of measurements
with an 18 cm wave. made from on board the AN-Z laboratory airplane of IRE AN
SSSR. An observation has been made of the spectrum relationship of the rate

of variation in radioluminance (of. fig 9). occasioned by features of the

change in moisture content at different depths.

3. Screening Influence of the Vegetation Cover

For the purpose of obtaining quantitative estimates of the moisture content
characteristics of soil and subsoil in the presence of s vegetation cover.

it is necessary to know the screening influence of different types of vegetation
at various stages in the vegetation cycle. The parameters determining the in-
tensity of radiation of the underlying surface when covered with vegetation are:
the radiating power of the ground surface; the radiation transmission and

which rises above the ground water level. and, secondly. to the possible ex-
istence within the limits of the fringe of slight sudden changes in moisture

content.

reflection coefficients of the vegetation; and the extent to which the ground
surface is coVered with vegetation [5]. The following types of Vegetation
cover can be differentiated, the influence of which is considerably different:
agricultural crops at early stages of vegetation and cereal and grass covers;
"broad-leoved" agricultural crops (sunflowers. maize, beets and the like);

and undergrowth and forest vegetation.

At IRE AN SSSR experimental investigations were made of the screening influence
of these types of vegetation cover. Some data from experimental investigations
in the 3 to 30 cm waveband are shown in fig 10. The value of the reduction

factor. B . for the slope of the radiation versus moisture content curve,
e(U) . on account of the influence of vegetation is determined by the equation:

x.(Wa)-%.(Wa)

""uuv' .)-u(W.) ‘
(14)

where ‘r and r are the radiating power of the soil when covered with
vegetation and in the absence of vegetation, with soil moisture content values

of H1 and H2 .

It has been demonstrated that crops of rye, barley and clover represent a
semi-transmissive medium in the SH? wave band and are practically transmissive

with our waves. Estimates of the amount of integral absorption in the 3 to
30 cm range are characterized by values of 0.05 to 0.3 nepers.

broad-leaved crops of the maize and cotton plant type at the ripening stage
screen as much as 70 to 80 percent of the radiation with waves shorter than
[0 cm and reduce by 20 to 50 percent the slope of the radiation versus moisture

content curve with a 30 cm wave.

From data of experiments over forest areas and dense undergrowth, complete
screening of the soil's radiation has been observed with waves shorter than
10 cm. This conclusion follows also from the results of model estimates.

Conclusion

Experimental research conducted has demonstrated the promise of utilizing
microwave instruments for the purpose of determining the moisture content
characteristics of soil and subsoil in solving problems relating to land
reclamation and the hydrological cycle of soil, agriculture, hydrogeology.
etc.

The USSR Council of Ministers Central Administration of the Hydrometeorological
Service Central Geophysical Observatory imeni A.I. Voyeykov has conducted re-
search and obtained positive results from remote readings of the moisture
supply in dry-farming lands in Kazakhstan from the data of microwave radiometry
measurements from on board an lL-18 laboratory airplane [53].

At the IRE AN SSSR Special Design Bureau airborne microwave radiometric
hygrometers have been developed. utilizing the 2.25, 18 and 30 cm wavebands,
for IL-18 and AN-Z laboratory airplanes.

Tests of these instruments in different climate zones-in Central Asia. in

the North Caucasus, the Ukraine and Holdavia--have revealed the effectiveness
of utilizingthemfor the purpose of determining the degree of non-uniformity
in watering and the rate of drying of soil, for determining times for adding
fertilizers and for sowing. and for prescribing additional water supply irri-
gation procedures. for determining zones with a high ground water level (up to
0.5 to 1 m). and for monitoring the condition of water engineering structures.

The work does not claim to be a complete exposition of such a complex

topic as a result of a lack of sufficient practical testing of the methodo-
logical materials which have been deVeloped. Many questions still have not
been finally settled. The task which the authors set for themselves was to
attract the attention of organizations which are designing A80 and of
ministries to the problem of creating c-‘lectiVe-uae computer centers and
computer networks which will make it possible to increase the efficiency
of automated control systems.

Hucc Technological Basis

[Text] The structure of a nucc technological complex is determined by

the specifics of the collectivo use of resources and the work regime of
the HUCC hardware and should be multi-machine (at least two machines).

The necessity of having at least two machines in the nucc hardware complex
structure is determined above all by the requirements for reliability of
data processing. When one of the machines of the complex is down, the
most important jobs (with the highest priority) are performed on the other
machine.

Arising from the experience of collective use of computer technology in
other countries and from analysis of the tasks performed in Hucc. first
of all financial accounting and statistical accountability (tasks with
large-volume files, run less than daily, and complexity of 200-500 coussnd
bytes), technical-economic planning (tasks with large-volume files, run
more than ten days apart, and complexity of 1000-5000 consand bytes), and
operational planning and regulation (real-time tasks, with small-volume
files, run at least one time a day, shifts, complexity of 5004000 com-
mand bytes), it is essential to provide for computer work in mcc in the
following regimes:

time-sharing (for running and testing moderate-sized engineering and scien-
tific research jobs, as well as debugging all other kinds of jobs);

batch mid-programing (Ker running ootn engineering and economic large-
scale jobs);

multiprocessing (for large-scale jobs).
One must note that a multiprocessing regime requires the solution of com-
plex problems in linking computers, special progrssssing of the jobs being
run, and control of performance of jobs.

In the HUCC both local (traditional for information-computer centers) and
remote data processing is done.

Processing of information in a mcc does not in principal differ from its
processing in an ASU with its own computer center and therefore it can be

carried out in accordanCe with the recommendations (I, o. 12, etc.). It is
appropriate to run jobs in a local mode of data processing in an HUCC for
users for whom it is economically more profitable to transmit information
by courier than by cmnmunications lines.

in cases where use of a courier for data transmission is impossible (it
does not provide for, for example. timeliness requirements) or is econom-
ically unprofitable, processing of data in the HUCC must be done with a
system for teleprocessing of data (STD).

The system [or teleprocessing of data must provide for all stages of the
technological process of data processing, from collection and transmission
to return to the user.

According to the assumptions of the MUICN structure and the tendencies
for use of the HUCC computer resources. they can be divided into three

types:

Mucc for processing information to coordinate the work of a group of sub-
scriber enterprises, unconnected with tasks for managing individual enter-
prices (MUCC of the first type).

it is assumed that subscribers to the NUCC-ASUP will have their own com-
puter centers for running enterprise management jobs;

HUCC with a combination of the functions of processing infonnation con-
nected with management of main subscriber enterprise and coordinating the
work of all enterprises serVed by the multi-user computer center (Hucc of
the second type). It is expected that subscriber enterprises, except for
the main one, will haVe an ASH? with their own computer centers for handl-
ing their management tasks, while the A80? of the main enterprise will
subscribe to the computer capabilities of the MMCC (a NUCC some of whose
subscribers have their own computer centers while others do not can also
be associated with this type):

HDCC for processing information on the management of individual subscriber
enterprises (HUCC of the third type). It is assumed that enterprises
serVed by the multi-nser computer center do not have their own computer
centers and running of management jobs for individual ones of them will

he done by subscribing to the computer capabilities of the HUCC.

It is natural that the calputlng power of the HUCC hardware complex is
dependent on the number of subscribing objects and their flows of informa-
tion being processed in the NUCC.

0n the basis of an analysis of the experience of creating an AS"? on the
basis of a HUCC it is possible to recommend three classes according to
capability in creating HUCC:

.."I

FOR OFFICIAL IISE ONLY

Claus l HUGO-the number of IIst attached to one HUCC is from [iw to
«even (the capability of the computer complex is more than 0.8 million
operations per second);

Class 2 HMCC--the number of A50? attached to one MUCC is from three to
five (the capability of the computer conplex is from 0.3 to 0.8 million
operations per second);

Class 3 chc--the nunber of A80? attached to one HUGO is three.

The recommended HUCC hardware complex configurations are presented in
table 2. and their types and classes in table 3.

The anc hardware complex structures presented in table 2 can be used as
approximate in designing the technical tasks in HUCC planning. Along with
this the required Hucc computing capability is tentatively determined as s

result of the totality of the size of the conputer jobs of potential sub-
scribers (1).

1. Type of W00 3. Number of HUCC hardware complex
2. class of H066 structure

The foundation of the M066 hardware complex is made up of models of Yes
computers and ASVT [modular system of computer technology], while to meet
all the requirements for information processing in the NUICN the base
models must be supplemented by peripheral equipment (in particular, memory
and printing devices), teleprocessing equipment, etc.

The components of the hardware complex are determined at the technical
planning stage (1;.

The hardware complex structures presented reflect the peculiarities of
information processing in NUCC of various classes and types with different
purposes and characteristics of tasks and are oriented (in composition of
devices) toward use of batches of applications programs. HUCC differ one
from another in productivity. capability of organizing work with the type
of basic hardware carrier used [or primary and intermediate data, the
capability of operating in batch processing and real-time modes, and orien-
tation toward specific means of transmitting data.

To provide direct access to the computer for a large number of remote users
of subscriber points, in structures l-S and 8-16 various types of aubassem-
blies of data transmission multiplexors (HPD) from the Yes series of com-
puters are used, depending on the power of the subscriber net of users.

The remaining structures (6, 7, 17, 18) are provided with UVTL-H (UVTL-T
(device for input/output of telegraph information]) to attach CRT units
from the ASVT-H series (Ekran-H system).

Structures 2, 6, 8, lo, 13. and 18, intended for HMCC of the second type,
are able to provide for production control in real time, which is attained
by using devices for remote collection, exchange, and distribution of data
R1-8901 (P-ZJll), linked to series res and H4030 computers. The 31-8901
makes it possible to organize a multiplexer work regime within a radius

of lo km of automatic data acquisition devices of type Rl-7701. 31-7501
from the ASP! series placed directly in the work places, shop, and plant
services of the main enterprise. When the computer is down, the RI-890l
puts data out on punched tape, which permits data collection to be carried
out while the computer is down or during preventive maintenance. Remote
collection of data at distance greater than ten km is possible with tele~
processing equipment from the Yes series.

In structures 2, 10, ll, 13 a Yes-7566 external alphanumeric display group
control unit is used; in structures 3 and 8, the Yes-7066 graphic display;
in structures 6, 7, [8, £P-6030 CRT's. The devices used are intended for

a dialogue connection of the subscriber with the system for real-time data
processing, with display of information on a cathode-ray tube.

For handling planning automation tasks in variation 2, plotters are pro-
vided for. For this purpose in structures 6. 7, 17. 18 "ERG A5231 de-
vices for electrographic display of graphic information can be used with
an M0030 base computer. These devices additionally can be used for their
primary functions as alphanumeric printers of the ATsPU Yes-7033 type.

The most powerful systems (variations 1-7, 9) are provided with the SPO-
9000 machine control system for centralized preparation of a large volume
of data.

The area of application of the small M5010 computer in a HUCC will be rather
varied--from subscriber computer centers for smaller enterprises to auxil-
iary computers in large hierarchical systems.

Use of the SK channel matcher for Yes computers. intended for attaching
the H5010 computer to the central computer anodels res-1022, res-1033.
Yes-1035, Yes-1050. H6030), makes it possible to employ the small com-
puter in a multi-precessor system.

The presence of "channel-channel" adapters in the structures presented
provides for the possibility of running a multi-processor system with shared
external memory.

For organizing multi-processing of data it is essential to have a dual-
access main memory in the types of computers used.

The HUCC hardware complex structures presented in table 2 may be modified,
for example, by substituting equivalent models of computers. One must
keep this in mind, since. for example, certain ministries are oriented
toward a specific type of hardware (e.g., only res computers).

In addition to the computer hardware presented in table 2, H000 must be
provided with desk calculators and adding machines for numeric checking
operations and staple calculations, copying machines, and also laboratory
instruments and auxiliary equipment (oscilloscopes. volt meters, amp meters,
generators. constant current sources, transformers, ohm meters, meters for
measuring semiconductor devices, turning-milling equipment, fitting equip-
ment and instruments, etc.).

The HUCC must also be supplied with office equipment. The calculation of
office equipment, organization and equipment of archives of machine data
carriers and documents, job slots for personnel, development of the tech-
nical assignment for designing the building (facilities) for the HUGO.
calculation of the sire of the facility, matters of communications, in-
stellation of broadcast networks, timing facilities. and signalling equip-
ment in the HUCC, as well as selection of auxiliary equipment are carried
out just as for any information-computer center and may be done in accord-
ance with the recmmmendations presented in works (1, 6, l2, etc.).

Requirements for M060 Facilities

[Excerpt] In accordance with ORMM [Industry-Hide Master Methodological
Materials] (8), the form, contents, and order of developing planning esti-
mates and performing construction and installation work is regulated by
the documents on construction from USSR Gosstroy, the Instruction on De-
Veloping Plans and Estimates for Industrial Construction (SN-202-76) and
other normative documentation which is in effect.

The architectural and construction part of the MUCC plan should be de-
veloped by a specialized planning organization (as a rule, by industry-

wide state planning institutes) on the basis of an assignment for planning
and direct contracts with the customer.

The order of developing a MUCC and also its composition depend on in what
kind of building the multi-user computer center will be installed-~a new
one or an already existing one.

In planning a new special building for installing the MUCC the object tech-
nical-work (technological) plan is developed in its full form in accordance
with SN-202-76.

"hen installing the MUCC in an already existing building, as a rule, the
technological, construction, sanitary and electrical engineering portions
and estimates are developed in the plan. In this case the construction
portion of the plan envisages only the equipping of the site in accordance

with the technological requirements and construction norms. Along with
this special attention is given to pre-planning work: inspection of the
building with the aim of determining the possibility of installing a multi-
user computer center in it from the standpoint of meeting the requirements
of the technological, construction, sanitary engineering and fire-prevention
norms. At the same time the soundness of the structures (roofs, walls.
beams, columns, etc.) must be determined according to their load-bearing
capability and rigidity.

The requirements for the facilities and the technical essigment are de-
veloped on the basis of the hardware ::mplex selected, special requirements
for its installation and standards in effect, the structure and personnel
schedule of the HUCC, the space set aside, requirements in the architec-
tural and construction and sanitary engineering aspects, electrical power
supply, lighting, fire and explosion safety, vibrations; comunicstions,
radiofication, and civil defense. The general requirements for caaputer
center facilities (presented, For example, in "A80? Standard Planning De-

cisions," "Hardware," part 1) (12) may be used, while modifications are
made according to the concrete situation of the HUCC.

In constructing buildings for multi-user computer centers special attention
must be paid to machine rooms. when using Yes or ASV'l‘ model computers, the
machine rooms must meet the following basic conditions: height of the room
must be at least 3 meters; height of doors, 2 meters, with a width of at
least 1.5 meters; illumination at a height of 1 meter from the floor, 190-
200 lux; temperature when equipment is working in the range of +5 - +60° C;
atmospheric pressure, 76030 are ﬁg; load on the floor, up to 700 kg per
square meter; dust should not exceed 15 nanokg per cubic meter with parti-
cle size no greater than 3 microns.

The most favorable working conditions are provided with a temperature of
2232°c and a humidity of 65257.. To attain them, it is recemended that the
facility be sealed and air conditioned, while magnetic tape and disk devices

should be set up in separate facilities with maximum possible freedom from
dust.

The technical assignment, as a rule, does not consider requirements for the
facilities which contain air conditioning equimsnt, ventilating equipment,
and the main switchboard, the cloakroom, conference room, and supplementary
services, since they are not related to the technological subdivision of
the multi-uscr computer center. The planning organization selects the site
and equipment for the indicated subdivisions and plans all HUCC facilities
in accordance with the standards and requirements which are in effect.

In computing and allocating space among the subdivisions it is essential
to take into account the type and quantity of equipment, the number of
employees in them, interconnections between them, and the flow routes for
movement of technical documentation and recording media.

For machine rooms according to the producing plant's technical conditions
and taking into account the requiremenzs oi the technological process of

processing information it is essential to have areas (in square meters)
(or the computer:

Yes-1033 -- 110-120
Yes-1030 -- 90-110
Yes-1022 -- 100-110
Yes-1025 -- 75- 90
Yes-1035 -- 100-120
Yes-1045 -- 100-150
H-SOOO -- 50- 60.

Areas for subdivisions of the multi-user computer center and the subscriber
information point (SIP) are computed in accordance with personnel schedules,

equipment selected. and space standards recommended by standard plans for
walking spaces (1, 12).

For locating the management staff on area of 16-18 square meters is accepted;
[or technical engineering personnel. 4.0-4.5 square meters for one workspace;
[or operators and aids working with small computing machinery and date prepa-
ration equipment an area of at least 6-10 square meters is essential. and

in some cases even more.

In computing the areas of the MUCC and SIP, selecting standard workspaces,
and supplying them with equipment at various stages of the development one
can use the recommendations presented in the literature (1, l2).

Part I. Textbook for Technical High Schools) in Russian 1978 signed to

(Annotation. excerpt and table of contents from book by h. H. Surin and
T. N. Yskupovs. Statistika. 15.000 copies, 279 pages]

[Text] The first part of this textbook is designed for students at the
technical high schools in the specialty of the "organization of machine
processing of economic data." and was written in accordance with the program
for the course in "punch computers."

In the textbook primary attention has been given to describing the operating
capabilities of these machines and the methods of programming economic data
processing problems.

In addition to the students at the technical high schools. the book can be
useful to computer installation people and students in the various ad-
vanced training courses.

[Excerpt] The functioning of various levels of automated control systems is
based on the effect of applying a set of technical means. the principal ones
of which are the digital computers. Depending on the operating capabilities.
the digital computers are broken down into keyboard computers. punch computers
and electronic computers.

The keyboard computers are the simplest in use. They are used when it is
necessary to perform mathematical operations. and the choice of the se-
quence of these operations is left to the operator. The table-model keyboard
computers have become widespread. many of which are executed from electronic
elements and permit the performance of all of the arithmetic operations.

They include the automated invoice and bookkeeping machines with program
control. Data processing on these machines includes a set of man-machine
operations coupled by a defined algorithm. The automated execution of the
operations built into the machine in a defined sequence is realized by a

program which has been set up in advance for each specific operation sepa-
rately. A distinguished feature and the primary deficiency of the keyboard
computer for processing economic data is the manual input of the initial
data. Therefore when solving problems with a large number of initial data
and when grouping of this data with respect to defined attributes is required.
it is more efficient to use the punch computer to compile the various summary
tables.

L
The punch computers include a set of defined machines designed for successive
execution of interrelated operations with respect to preparing the machine
carriers of the initial data-uthe punch cards--from which these data are
read by automatic machines during mathematical and logical processing. These
automatic machines have complex program control. Therefore when designing
the technological processing of economic data using a punch computer the
necessity arises for programming the automatic solution of the problems
on specific automated machines. This is a very tedious operation requiring
special knowledge. The quality of the compiled programs and consequently.
the efficient application of the machines depends to a high degree on the
depth of knowledge of the specialists with respect to the operating principles
and operating capabilities of the punch computer.

The study of the basic units and operating capabilities of the machines. the
procedures for working with them and programming techniques for solving
various economic problu.s is the subject of the course on "operation and
maintenance of punch computers." But. however deep the knowledge of the
machines and their o;erating capabilities. this is still insufficient for
successful development of the most efficient programs. Each student must
have a creative approach to the search for the optimal solutions when
creating specific programs for the punch computers.

At the present time thousands of sets of punch computers are in operation
on which a significant proportion of all of the economic data processing
problems are solved. The plan for the development of the national economy
provides for production of them also during the Tenth Five-Year Plan. The
punch computers are being continuously improved. and machines are being
built in new versions with improVed operating capabilities and electronic
elements.

This textbook is designed for the students at the technical high schools
to study the operating capabilities 0' punch computers. It was written as
applied to the existing training program and consists of two parts. The
first part includes general information on the punch computers and an in-
vestigation of the operating capabilities of punch machines. controllers.
sorting machines and the T—th tabulator.

Chapters 1-2 were written by T. s. Yakupova. and the foreword, general
information and Chapters 3-16. by N. M. Surin.

Editor's Comments

The results of research in high current electronics. carried out at the
Institute or Atmospheric Optics of the Siberian Department of the USSR
Academy of Sciences, at Tomsk Pnlytechnical Institute and at the Tomsk In-

stitute for Automated Control Systems and Radioelectronics. are given in
the book.

The collection contains articles on techniques of obtaining high power. nano-
second pulses. which are of independent interest for those engaged with nano-
second pulse engineering. in this sec.iun. we would especially like to note
the work of the group of Yu.A. Kotov on the utilization of an LC network with
current cutoff to obtain high power. nanosecond pulses. This method. in which
an inductance is used as the intermediate energy storage device. permits the
development of high power nanosecond and microsecond electron accelarators.
Such accelarators differ from the traditional ones in the significantly
smaller dimensions and the capability of simple control of pulse width.

Studies of the behavior of exploding wires in an LC network on the basis of
the application of similitude theory and dimensional analysis, which were
begun in the earlier works oi this group.are continued in this work. Simi-
Iitude theory permits a reduction in the number of independent factors and
substantially facilitates the interpretation of the experimental data. In
analyzing the various hypotheses concerning the mechanism of wire explosion,
it is shown that the hypothesis of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities contra-
dicts the similitude criteria. which have been confirmed experimentally. while
the hypothesis of F.D. Bennet concerning a vaporization wave. although it is
in agreement with the similitude criteria. nonetheless does not reflect the
experimental relationships.

if in the initial periods of the development of high current electronics.
basic attention was devoted only to the generation of nanosecond. relativ-
istic electron beams with a high current density. now the range of requisite
beam parameters has expanded. For example. to create high power gas lasers,
both nanosecond and microsecond beam with current densities from 10‘ a/cm2
to l .n/cm2 are necessary. In this case. beams with a low current density
have a large aperture (up to l m2 and greater). The wide beams are also
necessary for plasma chemistry. for the design of injection thyratrons, high
power switchers. etc.

Fur this reason. considerable attention has been devoted in the first section
of the collection to electron sources with a large cross-section using ex-
plosivc emission and emission from a plasma. In the papers given in the
second part. it is shown that by using explosive emission of electrons. one
ran now generate pulsed electron beams with pulse widths from fractions of a
nanosecond to seVeral microseconds. Where cathodes with explosive emission

are employed. questions of cathode stability and the structure of the electron
beams are important. These questions are also covered in this collection.

Plasma electron sources can he employed to increase the pulse widths. SeVeral
artleles are devoted to a treatment of the special features of sources in
which the electrons are extracted from a plasma of low voltage discharges into
a vacuum and a rarified gas. The expediency of using reflectiVe discharge
from cold cathodes in a magnetic field in electron sources is demonstrated.

as a result of which it becomes possible to design pulse plasma emitters with
a large emitting surface by virtue of expanding the plasma, which penetrates
into the vacuum from an arc deriVed discharge with s cold cathode. These
researches provide the basis for the deVelopment of electron guns. which are
effective in electron beam technology. quantum electronics and other fields.
Such sources have substantial advantages over guns with a bot cathode. since
incandescent components are not employed in them, there is no ion bombardment
influence on the parameters of the beam. and there exists the possibility of
realizing pulse emission through the use of pulse discharge.

The bunk contains three papers on the action of electron beams on metals.
tases and solid dielectrics. The process of heating the surface of a metal
with an electron beam having a duration on the order of 108 s [sic] and with
a power density of [07 -- 5 ' l0a w/cm2 plays an important part during elec-
trical discharge in a vacuum and in the diodes of nanosecond electron accel-
erators. The article devoted to this question in essence represents a con-
tinuation of the research started as early as 1967.

la the article concerning the action of an electron beam on gases in the
presence of an electric field, the possibility of obtaining a low tempera-
ture plasma with high density of neutral particles is demonstrated. This
method of obtaining a low temperature plasma has advantages over the well-
hnown ones. since in the first place. it makes it possible to obtain a plasma
at practically unlimited pressures and gas volumes. and secondly, makes it

possible to separatly regulate the main parameters of the plasma: the electron
temperature and the concentration of discharge particles.

in the article by 0.1. Vayshurd, et al.. a cycle of work is continued on the
action of the nanosecond pulses radiated by high current electron beams as
wide band dielectrics and semiconductors. The first work on the action of
high power beams on ion crystal dielectrics and glass has been accomplished
thanks to the fact that as early as 1969. a series of high current. name.

investigations have allowed for the detection of a number of phenomena which
are interesting in both as regards scientific and practical applications:
brittle fracture of ionic crystals, semiconductors and glasses; fundamental
plasma luminescence. which possesses temperature indiependence and subnano-
second flash times; a picosecond component of electron-hole conductivity of
dielectrics. One can now say that a new direction has arisen in the radiation
physics of dielectrics. which is related to the study of degenerate electron-
hole plasma. the density of which is 10‘ - 109 greater than in the case of

Introduction

The study of light scattering has considerably enriched our knowledge of both
the structure of molecules and the structure of liquids and solids.

At the present time, the phenomenon of molecular scattering of light is widely
used to study the structure and properties of the molecules of compounds of
low and high molecular weight. The method of light scattering is employed to
determine the velocity and absorption factor of sound in amedium, and to study
their disperion at very high frequencies. This procedure finds application
for the study of the thermodynamic properties and structure of solutions.

IL has also come to be used in recent years for the determination of the dif-
fusion coefficient.

This book nequuints the reader with the basic questions of the phenomenon of
the Rayleigh scattering of light. It is written to a considerable extent on
the basis of material derived in the physics faculty of Leningrad University
and contains a number of new theoretical and experimental data, which have not
appeared in other publications or review articles.

The valency and optical polarization relationship of the polsrizsbility of
molecules is treated in detail, by means of which, on the basis of experi-
mental data, the main polarizsbilities of many simple. double and triple
bonds are calculated. The resulting numerical values are used to find the
polarizabiiity tensor and thestructure of complex molecules.

Kore precise formulas are derived for the intensity of light scattering in

liquid and solutions, in which, along with the fluctuations in the dielectric
permittivity. fluctuations of the exciting field are also taken into account.
Experimental data derived in the laboratory of the author and in other labor-

atories are given, which attest to the good agreement between these data and
the new formulas.

Attention is turned to the relationship between the intensity of light scat-
tering and the thermodynamic properties of a solution. It is shown how the

partial pressures of solution somponents can be determined from the experi-

mental data on light scattering in solutions.

Results of studying the small frequency spectrum of molecular crystals are
given, and the relationship between the small frequency spectrum of crystals
and anisotropic light scattering in liquids is indicated.

Naturally. the book does not encompass all of the questions of the molecular
srattcring of light. Many important questions remain outside the scope of
the book or are treated extremely briefly.

[Text] The structure of an actual medium and the specific Leatures of the
ane field in the reflected wave procedure are analyzed unini the conditions
of the Russian platform. A procedure is developed for the formulation of
thin stratified models based on the data of acoustical logginL. Sew and ex-
isting methods of theoretical calculations of seismograms on computers are
described and discussed. Methods are developed for the experimental analysis
of the wave field at the surface and at internal points in the medium. The
nature of the waves is specified more precisely and e new classification of
the waves is made. where the waves are recorded using the reflected wave
method in platform regions. The causes of a reduction in the efficiency of

Introduction

Seismic methods are the basic methods for studying the internal structure of
the earth. in terms of the volume of work which is being done, its scientific
and technical level and the theoretical development work. the leading role
amuung all of these methods belongs to seismic surveying. It is of consider-
able national economic importance, especially in the field of searching for
and surveying petroleum and gas deposits. The overwhelming portion of the
work in this direction is being done by the reflected wave method (NOV).

in the last decade. reflected wave seismic surveying has been living through
a period of rapid scientific and engineering progress. The introduction of
multiple coverage and digital processing systems for seismic recordings, and
the use of new methods of analyzing and interpreting the ane fields on elec-
tronic computers have promoted an increase in the depth and confidence level
or the results of seismic studies in all regions of our country.

The common depth point method (OCT) [156. 157] which came into being in the
beginning of the 1960's. at the present thme has actually replaced for pro-
duction work all of the remaining variants of reflected wave surveying. The
works of v.1. Meshbey. Ye.A. Kozlov, P.C. Gil'bershteyn. B.L. Lerner. 6.6.
Tabakov. v.5. Levyant and many other researchers [71. 91-93. 96-98. 128.
160] have promoted its successful apiicntion in the USSR. The contents of
this procedure rapidly passed beyond the simple summing cf paths using the
common depth point method with the introduction of kinematic and static cor-
rections. it now includes dIVerse complexes of programs for the velocity
analysis of the wave field and preliminary improvement of the input data:
fan and Inverse filters. seVeral methods for subtracting noise, etc.
Ian, on, 68-76. 35. 98. 106. 108. 119. 128, 148. 155, 160]. Based on multiple
coverage systems. methods are being developed for determining the stratum
Velocities and the lithologic composition of rocks. automatic plotting of
depth sections, bypassing their time analogs [96. 9/. 128. 130. 1‘5. 151.
131. 158, 161. 162]. The works of Yu.V. Timoshin on the diffraction con-
versions of seismic recordings [133] has won considerable recognition here
at home and abroad. The first articles on the use of the principles of
holography in seismic survoying have appeared [20]. 6.1. Petrashen and

S.A. Nakhamkin have worked out the plotting of seismic sections using the
method of converted wave prolongation [26].

it must be noted that the common depth point method was not anything finde-
mentally new for seismic surveying. The grouping of seismographs has been
used for a long time in this regard [25. 27, 52. 118. 139]. L.A. Ryabinkin
and his students haVe treated the extremely effective method of variable
directional reception (RNP) [119. 125. 126]. S.A. Nakhamkin proposed the
procedure for subtracting wave interference, which comes well recommended
[107. l09].

The theory of interference reception of regular waves is used to describe all
of these methods, which was worked out as applied to tasks of seismic survey
lug by F.M. Gol‘tsman [45]. also being developed by him and his coworkers
are statistical approaches to signal separation (optimum reception) and the
interpretation of geophysical data [66-é8. 67, 88. 136]. S.A. Kats has come
up with a rather well put together theory for multichannel filters and has
tested sevural of them while working in Nizhnoye Povolzh'ye [64-66].

Acoustical logging (AK) of deep wells yields detailed information on the
Velocity parameters of a section [60-63. 87]. initially. discrete variants
of acoustical logging were employed. and later continuous variants. At the

present time. acoustical logging equipment - LAK, SPAR, "Zvuk" [l9] - exists
in all geophysical trusts, but acoustical logging is primarily used for com-
mercial on-site geophysics. It illuminates individual intervals of a sec-
tion which are not extensive. Obtaining data throughout the entire depth
range should be simplified with introduction of acoustic studies in cased
wells [87]. Articles are devoted to the development of a procedure for the
use of acoustic logging materials for seismic surveying [39, 41, 63, 77, 86,
127].

Direct representations of the structur. of a medium, which acoustic logging
yields, are extremely valuable. The primary conclusion drawn concerning the
thin slratilication ofactual media, which has an enormous influence on the
development of new physical viewpoints, was based specifically on acoustical
logging data [9, ll. 39, 60, 77, 137].

a vertical seismic profiling (VS?) [26] method was developed by Ye.I.
Gnl'perin at the Institute of Geophysics of the USSR Academy of Sciences,
where this method has earned great recognition among geophysicists. It
possesses specific survey capabilities for studying the space near a bore
hole: the inverse hodograph procedure (06) [131, 132]. the nonlongitudinal
vertical profiling procedure (NV?) [120], etc. However, its main applica-
tions area is the analysis of the wave field and the derivation of the seismic
parameters of the structure of a medium at reference points. Vertical seismic
profiling observations involve specific technical difficulties, but fundamen-
tal limitations on its capabilities are related only to the sparseness of the
grid of reference wells. Multichannel vertical seismic profiling equipment
has been designed, and considerable work has been done to refine the obser-
vation procedure and process the analog recordings. By means of directional
summing and subtracting, the field at internal points in a medium is broken
down into descending and ascending waves [22, 31, 32, 137].

The main result of vertical seismic profiling in platform regions can be con-
sidered the visible confirmation of the reality of the formation of one-time
reflections throughout all intervals of the sedimentary cover [27, 137].

The presence of intense multiple waves has likewise been established. Special
procedures have been worked out for estimating the intensity of multiple
waves in media, where the main (strictly speaking, the only) multiple forming
boundary is the upper surface of the medium [103-105]. However, extracting
useful information from such rich materials remains limited due to the weak
implementation of methods for digital processing and analysis of vertical
seismic profiling data.

Evan greater services have been rendered by domestic seismic surveying in the
field of the theoretical development and the development of physical concepts
of the formation and propagation of waves. The direct and inverse kinematic

problems of the reflected wave method are based on the integration of systems
of ordinary differential beam equations. They have been solved sufficiently

completely for a broad class of media in the fundamental papers of

in the i950's and 1960's, a group of associates of the Leningrad Branch of
the Mathematics institute imeni V.A. Steklov and Leningrad State University
under the supervision of 0.1. Petrashen worked out a beam method for calcu-
lating the amplitude of individual waves as applied to seismic investigations
[1-5, 3), 110-113, 166]. The correctness of the beam method was justified

by means of comparisons with exact solutions for the simplest homogeneous
stratified axially symmetric media. It has also been used successfully for
inhomogeneous media with small vertical or horizontal velocity gradients
l2-h, S, 36, BOI and for media with curvilinear separation boundaries [6.
95]. A zero approximation of this method is also widely used for calculat-

ing the intensities of one-time and multiple waves in thick stratified sec-
tions [10. Sh].

The beam method of calculation in a conceptual sense corresponds to repre-
sentations of the geometric seismic behavior of thick stratified media.

This is reflected, in particular, in the fact that the divergence function,
which controls the change in wave amplitudes, can be derived by means of
simple differentiation oftlndn-hodugraphs [36. 80]. The physical limitations
of such concepts are obvious. a further development of the theoretical
methods for calculating the wave fields was related to the introduction of
computers. and went in two directions. In the first, the thick stratified
model remained as the basic model, but its parameters have an adequate degree
of freedom and can vary so that the results of the theoretical calculations
agree with experiment. The author of this model. B.Ya. Gelchinskiy, called
it the L-model [33, 35]. For the case of determined parameters, it degen-
erates into an "effective seismic model" (58").

in the other approach, being developed at the Institute of Geophysics of the
USSR Academy of Sciences [12, 13, 77, 137], more complex models of the medium
are constructed from the directly measured parameters of a section, without
bringing the results of the interpretation of the observed seismograms into
the first stage. The comparability of the theoretical and experimental data
(if this is possible) is the criterion here for the correctness of the repre-
scntation of the medium and the correctness of the conclusions reached. The

initai data for such models can only be obtained with a sufficient degree of
detail by acoustic logging.

The idea of complete preservation of the velocity characteristic of a seciton
is the most consistent one and is found in the procedure for calculating syn-
thetic scismograms for unidimcnsionai. ideally elastic media. The calcula-
tion routines employ an algorithm of V. Baranov and C. Kyunets [6]. The
first computations of synthetic seismograms in the USSR were performed by
".8. Pariyskiy and N.G. Mikhsylova [100. 101]. The work of G... Gogonenkov,
which is generalized by him in monograph [39], has promoted their wide intro-
durtion into seismic surveying practice. Considerable research in this field

has also been performed at the Institute of Geophysics of the USSR Academy
of Sciences and a number of other organizations [79, 82-84, 94, 123, 128].

individual attempts have been undertaken to extend the range of applications
of synthetic seismograms by means of bringing into consideration the absorp-
tion or by making a transition to two-dimensional models of the medium [37,
)8, 6], 8i, 135, 165). However, they have not left the stage of the design
of the individual trial programs and several illustrative calculations, some-
thing which is related to the'inadequate capacity of second generation com-
puters with which the geophysical enterprises are equipped.

in synthetics seismograms, the overall field of all waves close to the ex-
plosion point is computed. Rought estimates of the structural configuration
of the medium are recorded in practice here, but on the other hand, substan-
tial simplifications are intorduced intothc wave process (failure to take
divergence and absorption). For this reason, along with these methods,

L.l. Ratnikovaya has expanded work at the Institute of Geophysics of the

USSR Academy of Sciences to refine the beam method of calculating the dynamic
characteristics of individual waves in media which contain thin stratified
rock benches [120]. This approach is based on the notion that certain
sharply pronounced reference horizons are of the main importance in a section,
and that the influence of thin stratification of the medium plays a large
part in the formation of the reflected wave and has little effect on its pas-
sage. As a result, there appears the possibility of replacing the thin stra-
tified intermediate portions of a section with thick homogeneous or gradient
layers. In calculations of individual waves by the beam method, it is not
difficult to introduce the absorption and divergence, and for this reason,
such a method can be used to obtain characteristics of reflected waves at
different distances from the explosion point which are extremely important

to us. however, in this case, we can study only a part of the wave field,
related to the reference levels, while drawing up the overall recording path
is an extremely labor intensive process as regards the sorting out and sub-
sequent summing of the individual reflected waves, which are both one-time
and multiple waves.

The basic feature of the seismic field in stratified media is the enormous
number of individual multiply reflected waves. In the words of the graphic
expression of Ye.A. Losovskiy, with 150 boundaries in a section. "the number
of multiples waves which accumulate per one-time depth reflection will exceed
the total number of protons in the universe (N > 10 9)." Analytical expres-
sions for the amplitudes of the total field of all reflected waves (for the
ease of normal incidence) have been derived in his papers [94] in the most
fie"e form. This has proved possible only with an extremely idealized
structural configuration of the medium: a periodic structure with reflection
factors equal in terms of their absolute value. For this reason, only the
most general laws governing the wave field have been derived in this manner.

when using a procedure for calculating individual reflected waves, the problem
of the large number of them becomes an urgent one from the viewpoint of the

69

possibility of sorting out all of these waves, as well as selectinn their
individual, sufficiently significant representatives. Such problems are
solved for horizontally stratified media by combinatorial methods, which
were coupled with the beam methods of T.l. Vavilovaya [20, 21, 113]. She
advanced the extremely fruitful idea of "enlarging" multiple waves by group-
ing them into a family of kinematic and dynamic analogs. This has permitted
calculations based on only one representative of each family. However, the
number of families remains rather large. Considered in papers [#9, 76]

were some algorithms for the analysis of a wave field and the selection of
the most representative total multiple waves, based on a limited number of
which one can successfully put together an idea of the field as a whole.

Methods of calculating synthetic seismograms, individual reflected waves and
their combinatorial selection successfully complements one another. For this

reason. they are all used in solving various problems in the theoretical ana-
lysis of a wave field.

The possibilities for the general solution of inverse dynamic problems have
been studied by A.N. Tikhonov [13h], H... Lavrent'yev [89] and A.S. Alekscycv
[I]. As is well known, they are not correct. Although the mathematical tools
for their solution have been developed, they can hardly be applied to the con-
ditions of the seismic surveying of actual strongly inhomogeneous, thin strat-

ified media. It is as yet possible to use only the dynamic parameters of in-
dividual reflected waves.

At the same time, increasingly complex problems are facing seismic surveying.
Despite the increase noted here in the effectiveness of the reflected wave
method, in a number of regions there has as yet been no success in reliably
segregating and tracing the reflecting levels at great depth. Included among
are the most promising terrigenous deposits of the lower portion of the sed-
imentary sheath of the Russian platform. These are regions with a highly
developed industry, and for this reason, the problem of creating the requi-

site power engineering and raw materials resources is a particlolarly urgent
one here.

A further increase in reflected wave method effectiveness is possible only
as the result of developing the physical principles of this method.

At the present time, the complexity and dynamics of the physical processes

are taken into account to only a certain degree in the analysis of the wave
field. The interpretation of seismic data though is, as before, entirely
based on their kinematic characteristics and notions of geometric seismicity.
From these viewpoints, one cannot explain the causes of the inadequate effec-
tiveness of the reflected wave method in complex regions and outline approach-
es to refining the working procedure. With the introduction of digital pro-
cessing procedures using computers, seismic surveying is mastering at a rapid
pace and widely using the new approaches of the formal logic of computer
methods, probability estimates and the statistical theory of signal separa-
tion against a background of noise. Under these conditions, it is particular-
ly necessary to work out the physical principles of a method, which would be

in accordance with its new technical capabilities. Otherwise, the geophysical
contents of a problem can simply be lost in the formalized procedures for
solving it.

The results of developing the physical principles of the reflected wave
method for media with comparatively tranquil occurrence of the rock in plat-
form regions is described in this work. in this case, a complex of research
methods was used [9. 137), including:

l) Study of the detail velocity structure of actual media by means of acous-
tical logging of deep wells;

2) Theoretical calculations of wave fields on computers for models designed
around acoustical logging data;

J) Special experimental and procedural work on the surface and using the

vertical seismic profiling method for the experimentally studying the wave
field;

a) The analysis and generalization of materials derived in the processing
of ground magnetograms of experimental and production batches.

The work was closely tied to production observations in the Nizhnoye
Povoizh‘ye regions. we considered and made use of all of the actual data
obtained in the geophysical organizations of Saratov and Volgograd [16, 53,
58. 59]. The physical conclusions were checked directly in the processing
of the mass of material.

The basic features of the structure of an actual medium are treated in Chapter
l. and the most suitable model for it is selected. The second and third chap-
ters are devoted to ways of studying the reflected waves: to theoretical cal-
culations and some experimental approaches. Among the latter. primary atten-
tion is devoted to the method of vertical seismic profiling. which possesses
considerable fundamental capabilities, but as yet lags ground observations in
the field of the utilization of digital methods of analyzing and interpreting
seismic data. Results of a theoretical and experimental study of the field

of reflected waves in thin stratified media are presented in the fourth chap-
ter. The conclusions drawn here have permitted not only the explanation of
the basic features of the wave picture, but also the outlining of the ap
proaches to boosting the effectiveness of reflected wave seismic surveying

on the platform. To check them. the new methods of suppressing noise and
segregating deep, one-time reflections were developed and tested operationally
under production conditions. The fifth and final chapter is devoted to these
questions.

the seismogeologic characteristics of the regions of the papers are typical
for platform regions, and for this reason the results obtained here can be
extended to the entire Russian platform and other similar regions.
