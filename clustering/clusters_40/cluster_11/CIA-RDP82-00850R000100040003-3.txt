Besides. the use of different specific control systass. such as real-time
systems requires new criteria for choosing the progressing language. A
table is presented that gives sons tine and voluse indices characterizing
the use of applicable programing languages. All paraseters for setting up
the statistics were chosen for program written by prograners of approxi-
sately identical skill. Program in Assembler are written with the use of
both nacrocouands of the disk operating systen (DOS) and special user micro-
cousnds. In investigated problem 68 percent of the progress are written
in COBOL. 31 percent in Assenbler and less than 1 percent in PL/I. The
table presented allows cosparison of different programing languages with
respect to the tine for writing the progress. the nusber of cards of
original text. translation tine. nuisar of outputs per sachine up to con-
plcte debugging of the progran and so on. To define cooperative estisates.
an analysis was asde of the standard programs used in the data processing
systems. Analogous prograss were written with the use of different pro-
gra-ing languages for the nos/res. Analysis of the resultant data showed
that the nos: widely used progressing languages are 0080!. and Assewler.
Use of the hidier-lewel COBOL shortens the tine for writing progra- ot an

changes needed in economic data processing. reduces losses of tile necessary

ment in automated management system (ASU). As a result of analysis of

the fields of application of small computers. principal forms of representa-
tion of input and output data are defined, and classes and groups of exter-
nal devices are differentiated in accordance vitn these form: external
storage units. data input/output devices. units for co-unication betveen

[Text] A memory device is now available with self-checking that contains
acculmlators connected to their respective registers. checking units. MD
and OR logic elements. The disadvantages of the device are large hardware
expenditures and low reliability of the device. Among known devices the
closest technical solution to this invention is a device that contains
accumulators connected to an address register and to main and auxiliary vord
registers. and also contains digit-by-digit check units with inputs con-
nected to the outputs of the corresponding word registers. and has error-
detection nodules with inputs connected to the outputs of the min vord
registers, while the outputs are connected to the inputs or a control unit.
and in addition this device contains MID elements of a first group. The
first inputs of these AND lsments are connected to the outyuts o! the
corresponding Iain word registers. and the outputs of the MID elements are
connected through main OR elements to the inputs or an output register.
The device contains main MD elements of a second group that are connected
to the main word registers. A disadvantage of this device is that informa-
tion output is impossible in the case where failures arise in like cells
or the accumlators. This reduces the reliability of the device. The reli-
ability oi' the device is increased by adding MD and on elements. Some of
the inputs or the additional AND elements are connected to the outputs of
the digit-by-digit check units. while the other inputs are connected to the
control unit. Their outputs are connected to the inputs of the correspond-
ing additional OR elements. whose outputs are connected to the second
inputs or the Iain AND elements or the first group. Figures 1.

[Text] An examination is made or the problem of rational design of micro-
topology of a chip for storage units on cylindrical Iagnetic domains
(T320). By chip is mesnt a domain-containing crystal carrying on its tur-
i'ace the micmprinta of circuits for loving. recording, erasure. switching
and readout of TSMD. Sons ways to evaluate the quality of design of chip
structures are discussed. Calculations are done in application to the
structure of a chip with internal decoding of the accumulator address
register.

Selection is substantiated for two types of structures: symmetric with
peripheral location of two decoders specialized for recording and readout;
and any-etric with a decoder that coshinea these functions. Informational.
technological and generalized functional criteria are proposed for chip
design. The results are given in graphic form for convenience or engineer-

[Text] The authors consider the problem or designing a data playback
channel (TV!) based on magnetorenistive Permslloy microsensors. The basic
TVI requirements are formulated that stem ”on the peculiarities of the

output signal or the sensor and of interference signals; methods are
investigated for realizing these requirements in M design based on the

example of a circuit developed for a cylindricel magnetit- domein (Tle)
memory with a capacity of 256 lB-digit vords. The given TV! contains a
bridge circuit thet includes both mein end compensetory sensors and e peir
of resistors. preenplifier. plwback amplifier and a diode. The TVI is
realised by means of stenderd semiconductor microcircuits. The regions of
stable operation of the WI are determined as a function of the magnitude
of the sensor supply currents, controlling fields and working frequencies.
An effective vsy of increasing the interference immunity of the M is
pointed out—plecing the amplifier in a magnetic nodule. Beceuse this
method is not eppliceble to existing amplifiers due to their large overall

dimensions. it is planned to develop specie]. hybrid playback amplifiers for
cylindricel magnetic domein memories. Figures 6; references 3.

[Text] An examination is made of the problem of detecting cylindrical
magnetic domain (TsMD) with a diameter on the order or a few micrometers
by using the properties of acoustic waves. A comparative analysis is made
or different methods of registration of 1‘le: interaction of acoustic waves
with a logistic field, with a magnetized medium and with charge carriers in
semiconductors. It is concluded that the second and third methods have the
best outlook, which can be attributed to the possibility of exact detection
of TM) without increasing their dimension, and also to the low sensitivity
to stray pickups from the controlling fields. Some quantitative evaluations
are given on readout devices that use these methods. It is noted that one
element is couson to all readout devicesnthe transducer for excitation of
acoutic waves-which necessitates the development of effective structures
that can effect this excitation in the system comprised of an epitaxial
ferrite-garnet film and substrate. Technological procedures are discmsed
for realization of these devices. Figures in references 15.

essence to the given invention is a mechanical auory that contains non-

magnetic storage elemento, recording. readout and erasure units. The pres-
ence in such a aemory of control electromagnets with flat poles that have

n photoelectric data readout systea, considerably coaplicates the design
of the memory unit. particularly when it is necessary to develop a multi-

between tape roll diameter and the ntﬂer of a tone. the location of the
tone in only roughly determined. The use of mechanical mean. (code disks.
light source. lidtt sensor) for determining roll diameter increases the
overall dimensions of the device. complicates manufacture and adjustment.
and reduces reliability. The closest technical solution to this invention
is a memory that contains an accumulator with tape medium. this accmlator

improve the efficiency of business production activity of enterprises as a
whole. A brief description is given of sons of the not important reasons
for inadequacy in the effectiveness of computer influence on the find.
results of activity of enterprises. end nain ereas are substentiated for
improving their efficiency. A detailed examination is ads of the problem
of using colputers in processes of making unegerial decisions, particularly
under conditions of risk and indefiniteness. and the place and role of the
counter in this process is smstantisted with consideration of the existing
capabilities of colputers in the field of dsta processing and the presence
of e persox. as a basic element in the system of enterprise unagenent. The
use of computers in decision-asking processes under conditions of risk and
indefiniteness is considered on the basis of the ample of using these for
systenstic stw of causes of disruption of rhythm in production end losses
of working tine. which will enable en appreciable ilprovensnt in the effec-

nultiplication of binary-decinsl nubers. With the increasing venue of
tnlenochanicnl dntn being trnnnld tted and processed. such nodules have
inadequute speed and processing accuracy, and their use linits the func-
tional possibilities of the device. Because of linited possibilities such
on the lack of a subtraction operation and the low speed of the scaling
units. conparison operations are perforned by a special comparison nodule
with adJmtnents. which conplicates the circuit of the device as a whole.
In technical essence. the closest device to this invention is a unit for
processing telenechanical intonation that contains an arithnetic unit with
its first input connected to the first intonation input of the device.
while the second input of the aritluetic unit is connected to the first out-
put of a control nodule. and the third input of the arithnetic unit is con-
nected to the output of a coefficient-settin‘ nodule. The input of an
address noduleis connected to the address input of the device. and the first
output of this nodule is connected to the first input of the coefficient-
setting nodule. The second input of the address nodule is connected to the
first input of the register unit. The first input of the control nodule

is connected to the controlling input of the device. and the first output
in connected to the first input of the display. The device also contains
a checking nodule and a tiner with output connected to the second input of
the register unit. The purpose of the invention is to increase the speed
and accuracy of processing and to ilprove reliability and efficiency of
operation of the device. To achieve this goal. the proposed device incor-
porates an innediate-access aenory. a code co-utator. a node setter. a
buffer nenory for condition tags and a fornulapsettins nodule. Figures 1.

sidered as a criterion for effectiveness of operation of the network. This
criterion is defined as the st. of the values g.) 0 of packets 'k trans-

nitted over the networt in a unit of tine. It is assuned that the value of
