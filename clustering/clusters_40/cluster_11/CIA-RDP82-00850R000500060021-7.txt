SYSTEMS FOR INPUTTIM INFORMKI'IOII FROM PNEUMATIC TRANSMITTBRS INTO CONTROL
COMPUTER SYSTEMS

Moscow PRIBORY I SISTEHY UPRAVLENIYA in Russian No 9, Sep 81 pp 16-18

[Article by engineers V. A. Yashin, Yu. M. Grenaderov, V. i. Durayev and V. P.
Cumenchuk]

IText] lnputting information from transducers of process parameters with a pneu-
matic unified output signal (called pneumatic transmitters from here on) into con-
trol computer systems is a problem in engineering implementation of automated pro-
cess control systems in the chemical, petrochemical and related industries. As the
practice of development of such automated process control systems indicates, sig-
nals from pneumatic transmitters, as a rule, account for 50 percent of the overall
amount of information input automatically.

The most widespread method of inputting information from pneumatic transmitters
into control computer systems uses individual analog pneumoelectric conve ters
that convert a unified pneumatic signal of 20 to 100 kPa (0.2 to 1 kgf/cm ) into a
unified electrical signal of 0 to 5 mA that then goes to the load units (8N) in
the USO UVK [devices for object communication with a control computer].

The widespread application of this information input method has caused a severe
shortage of pneumoelectric converters, which is increasing continuously because of
the increase in the number of automated process control systems that are being
developed. Information systems built on the principle of individual conversion of
signals turn out to be very bulky and inconvenient in operation, and monitoring
the working order of the information channels in them is difficult. Existing
engineering solutions for group checking of the converters by using pneumatic
swicthing devices and reference elements for standard pressures are also not noted
for compactness [1]. More promising is the input of information from pneumatic
transmitters that have group switching and converting devices within them.

lnformation from transmitters is usually input now by using PK-3 type pneumatic
switches, controlled by control computer systems, that switch pneumatic signals in
advance I2]. In doing so, there is one PK-3 switch and PE-SSH converter for every
seven pollable pneumatic transmitters (one switch input is usually taken up by a
source of standard pressure and is used to check the working order of the converter)
Using this information input method permits a substantial reduction in the number

of pneumoelectric converters and a solution to the problem of checking them in each
polling cycle. However, this method has a number of substantial shortcomings.

As industrial tests of these systems have shown, polling the pneumatic transmitters
takes no less than 16 seconds of machine time in each cycle. During this time,

the control computer cannot perform other tasks. The PE-SSM pneumoelectric con-
verters often fail (adjustment is knocked off) because of the constant sudden
changes of pneumatic signals at the inputs. The information systems continue to
remain rather cumbersome.

The most promising method of inputting information into control computer systems
from pneumatic transmitters at the current level of development of technology is
the speeded-ep balancing method based on simultaneous comparison of the transmitter
signals with a developed balancing signal by using null-balance devices placed in
the individual transmitter circuits. There are a number of ways to implement this
method [3. 4]. However, at present there are only two systems in which these
methods have been implemented for inputting information into control computer sys-
tems from pneumatic transmitters.

(he such system is called the ASTRA-01 [5]. It is used for multichannel input of
information from pneumatic t-ansmitters into a control computer system. The system
can he used with the 1010V, M-6000, SH-l and SH-Z control computer systems with
the availability of the appropriate software developed in setting up the automated
process control system. The system output signal is an electrical 16-bit binary
code. A control computer system controls the system by an electrical 10-bit
binary code. The principle of system operation is based on the method of scanning
the channels in the space of the parameter. The input channels are permanently
connected to the individual comparison circuits. In one conversion cycle, the in-
put signals of all channels are compared to a common saw-toothed balancing signal.
lho output signals of the comparison circuits are converted into time intervals
proportional to them that are converted into codes by using the control computer.

lhe system has a modular structure and fits in a standard cabinet.

ASTRA-01 System Specifications

Basic error in measuring pneumatic signals as a percentage of

the range of variation of input signals, no more than :l.5
Maximum number of pneumatic inputs 120
lime for polling 120 pneumatic channels, in seconds 15-40

Prototype ASTRA-01 systems are in operation in the nitron and monomer shops of a
chemical plant.

'nu: shortcoming in the system is the long transmitter polling time. just as in the
iniormation input systems using the PK-3 pneumatic switches. In this system, it is
difficult to implement metrological monitoring of the information channels since
here only the control computer system itself can be the metering device.

1he Dzerzhinskiy branch of the OKBA [Experimental Desigr Office for Automation] has
dvvv|oped and manufactured a prototype system for inputting information from
pneumatic transmitters in which the saw-toothed pneumatic output signal of the scan
generator is fed simultaneously to the inputs of the null-balance devices and to an
analog pneumoelectric converter (APE?) [6]. An electric signal of 0 to 5 mA goes

FOR 0FFHJAL.USE(NVLY
from the APEP converter to the analog input (load unit) of the USO UVK [devices for
object communication with the control computer system]. The signals output from
the null-balance devices (closing or breaking of the electrical contacts) are fed
to the inputs for the system for inputting the iniative signals of the control
computer system.

The system principle of operation is based on the fact that during operation of the
next null-balance device, the control computer system receives an interrupt signal
and executes polling of the analog input with subsequent transfer of the informa-
tion to the appropriate storage cell. In the process, no special time is required
[or polling of the pneumatic transmitters. There are no severe pressure surges at
the APE? converter input. Metrological checking of the information channels is not
compiicated. Automatic checking of the working order of the APE? converter is
easily accomplished in each control computer cycle of operation (by connecting one
or more sources of standard pressure to the device input channels instead of trans-
mitters). The system has a simple design. Experimental industrial trials of this
system have shown its serviceability during operation under the conditions of the
process shops within the hardware for an automated process control system.

lhe shortcoming in this system is the presence of a large number of interruptions
in each operating cycle of the control computer system (corresponding to the number
of polled transmitters), which leads to considerable complication of the software
lor the automated process control system and reduces its operating reliability.

An effort is now underway at the Dzerzhinskiy branch of the OKBA to further Unprove
the system for inputting information from pneumatic transmitters that implements

the specded-up balancing method. In the process. the following goals have been set:
the system must basically consist of series produced automation hardware; automatic
monitoring of the working order. the capability of repair at the place of operation
and monitoring of the metroiogical characteristics of the information channels have
to he provided for; and use of the system must not complicate the automated process
control system software.

All the units of a system, preliminarily called the ORA-01, that meets these re-
quirements have now been developed and tested under industrial conditions. A
diagram of the system is shown in fig. 1.

The system operates the following way. The scan generator (GR) continuously puts
out a pneumatic signal varying according to the saw-toothed law. The signal varies
within the standard range of 20 to 100 kPa. The generator operating cycle is set
equal to the control computer system operating cycle. The signal output from the
scan generator goes to the inputs of the null-balance devices (BNO), the APEP con-
vertcr and the signalling units (BS). The null-balance devices are acrylic plastic
boards with comparison elements (P2251) and discrete pneumoelectric converters
(PIPR.4) installed on them. Each unit is designed for 10 input channels from the
pneumatic transmitters. Signals from the latter are fed to the anechoic chambers
or the comparison elements, and the signal output from the scan generator (GR) goes
into their other anechoic chambers. At the moment of equalization of these signals,
the comparison elements operate and the normally closed contacts of the correspond-
ing discrete pneumoelectric converters are broken. The breakings of these contacts
are the output signals of the null-balance units.

The APE? converter is used to convert the pneumatic signal output from the scan
generator (GR) into a current signal of 0 to 5 mA, which goes to the analog input
of the storage cell unit (BYaPl). The storage cell units convert the current sig-
nal into a proportional potential signal of 0 to S V, store in the storage cells
the values of the potential signal that correspond to the transmitter output signal
at the time of operation of the null-balance device and hold in storage the stored
values of the potential signals for the generator (GR) operating cycle time.

A storage cell unit schematic is shown in fig. 2. Each unit includes 20 storage
cells made of an inetgrator built with an operational amplifier (microcircuit
K284UD1A) and a K9305 field transistor [7]. The circuit features inclusion in the
feedback circuit of a source follower stage made with the KP305 field transistor.
This enables high ohm input of the integrator, which permits with relatively low
values of capacitance of C1 storing the input potential signal with the necessary
degree of precision for a long time interval and including in parallel a large
number of cells. Fig. 2 shows a developed view of one of the 20 cells of the

BYaP [storage cell unit] (cell 1 of the BYaPl unit).

The circuit operates the following way. A current signal of 0 to 5 mA goes to the
input resistance Rin’ entering into the BYaPl unit. Removed from this resistance

are the potential signals from 0 to +5 V which are then fed in parallel to all the
analog inputs of the storage cells of both the BYaPl unit and the other units.

When switch Bl closes, the input voltage goes to transistor gate T. is followed in
it and fed to the inverse input (13) of differential amplifier D. The voltage at
the output of the latter in magnitude is close to the input and is opposite to it
in sign. The output voltage is applied to the second plate of the capacitor Cl and

charges it to the level equal to the input. "hen switch 31 opens, the voltage at
output (8) of the integrator will be determined by the stored value of the voltage
in the capacitor Cl. A voltage divider, made with transistors R5-R7, is used to
set the initial zero voltage at the output of the integrator with zero input (zero
adjustment). Capacitor CZ is correcting and is designed to eliminate excitation of
the D microcircuit at high frequency.

Used as switches Bl-Bn (n is the total number of storage cells) are the normally

closed contacts of the corresponding null-balance devices. During operation of the
null-balance device in turn, the circuit of the input analog signal of the corres-
ponding storage cell is broken and stored at its output is the value of the
potential signal corresponding to the value of the transmitter output signal.

In level, the BYaP cell output signals correspond to the mean level of the UVK

[control computer system] and go directly to the switches for signals of mean level
in the USO UVK [device for object communication with control computer system].

When the scan generator (GR) output signal reaches maximum (100 kPa), the signal-
ling unit (88) operates (see fig. 1) and emits a discrete electric signal (closing
of contacts) to the input of the module for the input of initiative signals
(MVvIS) in the USO UVK [device for object communication with the control computer
system]. At this signal, the control computer interrupts operation on the main
programs and polls the inputs of the switch for signals of mean level (KSSU),
where the signals go from the storage unit cells. In the process, practically no
machine time is taken up for polling of the pneumatic transmitters and the automa-
ted process control system software is not complicated.

Two system hardware versions have been developed: a separate unit and a distribu-
ted. In the first version, all system units are placed in a separate standard
cabinet, in the lower part of which are installed the terminals for the leads of
the pneumatic cables. The cabinet is placed next to the distribution racks of

the USC UVK [device for object communication with control computer system]. In
the second version, the BNO [null-balance unit] of the scan generator (GR) and the
signalling unit (BS) are installed in a separate cabinet in the space for the con-
verters. Ihe storage cell units (BYaP) are made in the form of separate units
(fig. 3) and placed in the distribution racks of the USO UVK. Shielded cables
connect the BYaP cells and the null-balance unit. A specific version is chosen in
developing the automated process control system hardware structure. Also solved
simply in this system are the problems of monitoring the working order of the APEP
converter and metrological monitoring of the information channels.

[Excerpt] The growing use in industry and power engineering of the technique of
low and extremely low temperatures poses the problem to instrument makers of
developing precision transducers to measure and monitor the parameters of cryogenic
env‘ronments. in particular of pressure. Domestic industry does not produce
pressure transducers that operate at low temperatures. The pressure of cryogenic
environments is usaliy measured by transducers located at room temperature and
connected to the object by pulse tubes. This method, however, does not provide
adequate precision and does not permit neasuring pressure in the rotating parts of
cryogenic amchines, for example in superconducting generators and engines. The
requirement of insensitivity to a magnetic field is usually imposed on highly pre-
cise pressure transducers operating in cryogenic machines in addition to high
sensitivity, linearity of conversion and low tenperature error.

PROBLEM-ORIENTED COMPLEX FOR MONITORING PARAMETERS OF ELECTRONIC UNITS

Moscow PRIBORY I SISTEHY UPRAVLENIYA in Russian No 9, Sep 81 pp 31-32

[Article by E. 5- Verdish. candidate of technical sciences, V. V. Zaytsev and
M. B. Pisanov. engineers]

[Text] The AKIS (automated monitoring and measuring system) has been developed at
the P0 LEMZ [Leningrad Electromechanical Plant Production Association]
(Leningrad). This problem-oriented complex is designed to automate the processes
of monitoring electronic units in numerical programmed control devices (UChPU).
The complex has been implemented on a base of the "Elektronika-NTs" microcomputer
and made in the standard design of a numerical programmed control device (fig. 1).

lhe complex with the basic composition of
hardware and software permits by a pre-
complled program sending to the monitored
object stimulating (test) signals and

feed voltages, measuring the values of
parameters of signals output by the moni-
tored unit, comparing actual and permitted
parameter values, and sending to the
operator and recording information on the
check results.

The structural realization of the complex
is based on the modular-bus principle of
design which affords regularity of links
between the individual modules and also
simple adaptation of complex characteris-
tics to additional requirements that occur
in expanding the nomenclature of units
being checked.

 

The system architecture is illustrated by
the structural diagram (fig. 2). It is
controlled by the built-in "Elektronika-
NTs” microcomputer with an 8K 16-bit word
main memory. Fig. 1. External view of complex

20

FOR OFFIGAL USE ONLY
The microcomputer is linked to the system units by a unified-bus (UK). through
which control information and data are sent. The unified bus is joined to the
internal bus (VM) for the microcomputer by using a unified bus adapter (AUH).

Connected to the unified bus by means of controllers are the stimulating signal
generators (688), the measuring units (13), the perforated tape input unit (UFV)
and the operator console (P0).

1he electric typewriter (EPM) ("Consul-260") is connected to the microcomputer
through the standard input/output controller.

Since the system is oriented to executing a specific group of functions, a
specialized operating system was developed for it that permits implementation of
the following operating modes upon commands from the operator console (P0):
input to the main memory of the microcomputer of the test program to check the
object being monitored (0K);

search for a specific test program on the perforated tape by its number;
one-time execution of the sequence of checks provided by the monitor program;
output of check results in the form of satisfactory or defective to the operator
console and printer; and

cyclic measurement of the value of the signal parameter for the selected channel
with output of results of measuring to the operator console and printer.

21

FOR 0FFKJA1.USE10NLN
FOR OFFICIAL use ONLY

The check series is implemented by swicthing on the stimulating signal generators
according to the program and starting up the measuring units for measurement.

Switching the inputs/outputs of the unit being tested with the outputs and inputs
of the generators and measuring units is effected by using the replaceable switch-
ing unit (KB), which is also used to connect supply voltages to the unit tested
and to set the equivalents of output loads.

The basic system includes stimulating signal generators that generate signals with
the following characteristics: a sinusoidal voltage of alternating current with a
frequency of 100/" kHz, where 1\<N\< 1999, and an amplitude of 5 V; a voltage of
alternating current of rectangular form with a frequency of SOOIaN kHz, where

lg N\< 999 and a - 1, 10 or 100, with an on-off time ratio of 2 and an amplitude
corresponding to the TTL levels; a parallel 16-bit code with TTL voltage levels;
and single pulses of voltage of positive and negative polarities with a duration
of l microsecond with TTL voltage levels.

The measuring units included in the basic system allow measuring the following
parameters of electrical signals: voltage of direct current of positive and nega-
tive polarities within the range of 0 to 50 V with an error no worse than 0.5 per-
cent, within the range of 0.1 to 5 V and with an error no worse than 1 percent in
the range 5 to 50 V; pulse width within the range of 1 microsecond to 100 ms;
effective value of alternating voltage of sinusoidal form with a frequency of

45 Hz to 100 kHz in the range 0 to 50 V with an error no worse than 1 percent;
amplitude of pulse voltage of positive and negative polarity with a frequency of
«0 Hz to 100 kﬂz with a duration of no less than 3 microseconds in the range

1 to 50 V; repetition period of pulse signals of any polarity in the range of

l microsecond to 100 ms and a frequency in the range 1 kHz to 1 MHz; and the time
interval (delay) between the leading edges of two pulses of any polarity coming in
through different buses in the range of 1 microsecond to 100 ms.

Provided for in the system is the capability of measuring signal parameters and

comparing them to tolerances at internal points in the tested unit by using the

single-contact adapter (A) in the one-time or cyclic mode, which allows locating
defects in radio elements, microcircuits and printed connections.

An important system feature is the capability of simply adding to its functions by
connecting additional software controllable units or standard measuring instruments
with digital output, and by including in the operating system program modules

that. support mathematical processing of measurement results.

Experimental industrial operation of this system indicates that its application to
testing electronic units in numerical program control devices yields a four- to
fivefold reduction in the labor input to checking operations and rasies the

validity of checking.

METHOD FOR OBJECTIVE MASS CHECKING 0F THROUG“ HOLE PLAIING IN PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS
Moscow PRIBORY l SISTEHY UPRAVLENIYA in Russian No 9, Sep 81 pp 35-36

[Article by 1‘. v. Oleynik, engineer]

[Text] The need for research and development of a method of automated nondestruc-
tive quality control for plated-through holes in printed circuit boards (PPM) [PCB]
has arisen under the conditions of mass production to raise the process throughput
while assuring the required precision of measurements, to eliminate subjective mis-
takes and to raise the validity level.

By PCB plated-through hole quality control, we mean the solution of three problems:
detecting voids, pits and cracks in the metallization layer, determining the thick-
ness of the hole plating and checking to ensure contact between the deposited layer
in the hole and the copper foil on the PCB. It has been suggested that the first
problem be solved by using the fluorescent method [1]. The difficulty lies in the
proper selection of the reagent, the luminophor, the properties of which must be
technologically comaptible with the process for obtaining the hole plating.

There are several types of instruments based on different principles to measure

the thickness of through hole plating. The most suitable in terms of ranges of
measured values is the PKH-901 plating inspection instrument. However, it has
shortcomings: the checking process is performed manually by using a detached gage,
which causes extremely low instrument throughput; also, the possibility of de-
stroying the integrity of the palting is not precluded in the process.

Other devices designed to measure plating thickness, for example, the four-probe
and ultrasonic, are also unacceptable due to the considerable difficulty in
engineering implementation under the conditions of full automated checking.

Therefore, a compromise has to be found that is free of the deficiencies in the
existing methods and that meets the basic requirements imposed on an automated

checking system.

One solution to these problems is the use of the thermal method, as indicated by
an analysis of checking methods in use [2]. Its essence lies in determining the
qualitative and quantitative characetristics of the plating by the variation in
the thermal pattern radiated by the PCB plated-through holes. Application of this
method has been facilitated by the emergence of highly sensitive radiation detec-
tors that allow finding slight differences in temperatures in the different sec-

tions of the surface with adequate precision.

When [K [[8] methods are used, the

temperature of the object (the plated- *
through hole) must be different from
that of the background against which it
is observed. The required temperature
gradient is created by external ecita-
tion of the object, when the heat is
transmitted to it by theme]. conduction
or radiation. In this case, the object
temperature begins to rise. and one can 0 n N 30 60 a ma
judge the parameters of the sample under

investigation by its value or time of

reaching some threshold value.

    

Heat propagation time for different
In connection with this, one has to plating layer thicknesses [HRH - micro-
study the basic characteristics of meters]
substances and the physical processes
of heat exchange that flow in the
plating layer to detect defects in it
based on them.

A PCB plated-through hole can be represented in the form of a homogeneous isotropic
body with volume V, having an external surface with area S that is in a convective
heat exchange with an unrestricted median, the temperature of which is t(’$). He
have to find the distribution of temperatures u(x, y, sf!) within the plating
body at any point with coordinates x, y, z at time ’2 .

The differntial equation for the temperature distribution in the body when there
are no energy sources in it is [3]

val/v1 as aAu. (I)

The heat exchange with the medium occurs according to Newton's law, i.e. boundary
conditions of the third type are in effect [3].

At the initial time ('1' = 0), all body points have the same temperature, which
let us assume equals 0, i.e.

"(1. y. z. "Ina-0'

To solve equation (1) with the boundary and initial conditions, let us use the
operational method based on the integral Laplace transform:

F(‘)=5 ("1(1)“.
0.

wheref('t) is the assumed function, F(s) is the transform of the function f(¢').
and s is the Laplace transform parameter.

Then with regard to the initial conditions, equation (1) will assume the form

A U ‘1'- !I. 1. 3)-% U-(x. y. a. 0-0. (2)

The solution to equation (2) under the boundary conditions can be notated as:

le. y. z. s)-Y(x, y, z, 011:). (3)

The expression Y(x, y, z, s) or simply Y(s), in addition to the coordinates x, y,
z and parameter s, depends on the internal features of the body (its dimensions,
shape, and thermophysical properties of the plating). This expression is called
the transfer function for the body temperature with respect to the effect of

the med ium temperature.

By analogy with mechanical and electrical systems, the transformed medium tempera-
ture T(s) can be called the input function, and the transformed body temperature
U(x, y. z, s) the output function. Under this consideration, the body under
investigation is a unique thermal system that transforms the input value, the
medium temperature t('8), into the output value, the body temperature u(x, y, z, a).

To simplify, let us replace the transfer function Y(s) by the approximate

expression

where bk and al are expansion factors.

Let us restrict ourselves in expansion (4) to the terms It - 0, l - 0 and l - l,
and then the transfer function will assume the form

Let us find the equation for the transient process, when the medium temperature

Since T(s) - tols, then in the first approximation, substituting in equation (3)
the expression (5) and changing to the inverse transform ’03), we obtain

By expression (6), one can construct the time characteristics of the heat picture
existing on the surface of the plating of varying thickness d. Based on calcula-
tions, the relationship t' - }'(t) was plotted (see the drawing) with the follow-
ing constant values: t0 - 50'C, Fl . 390 Hlm X degree,

Analyzing the curves obtained, one can conclude that the time for heating
metallization of different thickness is not identical and varies from one to
several tens of seconds. If the temperature to is fixed at a certain level, then

according to the time for reaching it, one can judge the thickness of the metalli-
zation when the heat is propagated along the plating layer. Thus, for to - SO‘C,

The results obtained warrant the use of the described principle based on the.
thermal method for computing the plating thickness. The operation for checking
the quality of metallization of the through holes should be included in the PCB
production process and performed after the copper electroplating process.

He suggest using as thermal radiation detectors the HF-6 integrated photo
detector matrices or the HIE-15 semiconductor photoelectric matrix detectors of

radiant energy.

[Text] A unit for washing printed circuit board [PCB] holes by spraying water under
pressure has been developed at the Ryazan' PLanning and Technological Institute to
optimize PCB production processes, eliminate manual labor and raise the quality of
hole plating.

The unit principle of operation consists in water being sprayed under a pressure of
0.8 to 1 HPa that passes vertically through the PCB holes to wash out cuttings and
dust formed after drilling and mechanical scrubbing operations.

in the traditional washing method, many jets are installed over the entire width of
the transport element so that the water sprays pass through each hole. However,
this method requires high water consumption, and thus a high-throughput pump.

In the unit being described, the pump station size has been considerably reduced
and the pump is placed within the unit because of the use of two "traveling" jets.

The unit meets the requirement for installability in the process line and has con-
siderably improved washing quality and the capability of using return water.

The unit (see the drawing) consists of the base (6), on which the transport element
and washing unit (1) are assembled, and the pedestal (9) that houses the pump.

Hash unit (1) is a bearing assembly, made in the form of a cylinder, rotating on a
hollow axle, rigidly secured to a plate. The top cover is made as a pulley, and
the bottom flange is used to install and fasten two arms. In the bottom flange,
there is also a ring chamber where the water passing through the hollow axle goes.
In turn, the chamber is connected to the jets (14) by ring couplings, brass tubes
and a rod.

The space between the jets and the board surface is adjustable.
An electric motor (16) rotates the wash assembly. The assembly's rotation rate

matches the conveyor rate so that when the board moves a distance equal to the step
for drilling holes in a board, the jet will pass over this section at least once.

The availability of two jets rotating on
arms will allow, with relatively low pump

throughput. affording a good washing of "
all 0C8 holes over the entire width of

the transport element (3). The latter is 5
made of four roller units that in the u
aggregate make up seven pairs of

take-in/feed and four supporting .
rollers. The tske-inlfeed rollers are ,5

positioned so that no PCB section is not
processed in the washing. The support
rollers are used to prevent the board
sagging under the water spray.

The tske-inlfeed rollers are driven by
the worm gearing of the transmission
shaft (6) that extends through the whole
unit.

The unit can operate only as part of a
modular line, and with that, the
torque is transmitted to shaft (6)
from the drive module.

The wash assembly and transport element are covered by a hood (2), that along with
the base (6) and covers forms the operating chamber. Application of labyrinth
seals prevents splash out of the operating liquid (water).

The base bottom is funnel-shaped to collect and drain the used water into the pump

The pump (8) supplies water to the washing assembly. From the tank, the water goes
through the inlet pipe. the pump and the outlet pipe to the filter (7), and from
there to the washing assembly.

Filter (12) is used for pre-cleaning of the water coming into the tank from the
main, and filter (7) is used for fine cleaning of the water before it is fed to
the jets.

The unit is controlled by a control unit detached to the line control console.

housing (8), brush drives and oscillator.

The punp station, used to supply cooling liquid to the scrub brushes contains the
pump (type PA), a sparger for agitating Vienna line, a check valve, branch pipes
for various purposes and a replaceable filter (for coarse filtration).

The brush (2) is a mandrel with a set of resilient scrubbing elements. One end of
the brush has a conical mounting surface and two diuteral slots for mounting and

locking on a spindle, and the other has a spherical bearing to set the brush on an
immobile removable pin.

Installed in unit (A) are take-in/feed rolls to take in, hold and transport boards
in the module, bearing supports for the brushes, bearing rollers and mechanisms for
aligning and adjusting the clearance between the brush and bearing roller. The
oscillating drive of the brushes is effected by reduction gear box (7). Bearing
roller (11) is used to rigidly hold the boards on the scrubbing plane. The PCBs are
put in and fed to the scrubbing zone (or received after scrubbing) by the trans-
[nrter (6) with drive from the module.

Dressing mechanism (13) is used for periodic scrubbing of the surface of the
brushes without disassembly of them. It is a carriage mounted in two directions
(parallel to the take-in/feed rollers, bearing roller and brush working surface).
'nuc carriage is driven by turning a knob fixed on a lead screw. The carriage is
equipped with a tool (hard alloy, diamond, corundum and others) on a mandrel, that
can he discretely moved radially relative to the brush, by which the controlled
‘removal of the necessary layer is achieved.

Adiusiment mechanism (1) is used to set the clearance between the bearing roller and
the brush working surface. Drive shaft (15) extends through the entire module and
is driven by module D (U903).

Operation of the actuating assemblies and mechanisms (brushes, pump, sparger,
oscillator) is provided by the control unit, on the face panel of which the

controls and an ammeter are mounted. The ammeter is used to monitor the clearance
between the working surface and the bearing roller as a function of the scrub
brushes drive motor load. The optimal clearance is determined experimentally for

a batch of boards: at scrubbing time, the ammeter reading is recorded and board
scrubbing quality si checked. Scrubbing is continued so long as the board surface
quality meets the process requirements. Thus, the range of the load on the electric
motor is established, within which the required scrubbing quality is provided.

The unit operates as follows. A blank board is placed on the canvas of the trans-
porter (6) and is moved into the scrubbing zone for the bottom surface by using
take-in/feed rollers (12), and then into the scrubbing zone for the top surface.
lhe rotating brush removes the oxide film from the board surface. At a brush rots-
tion frequency of [000 rpm and board feed rate of 0.65 m/minute, from 0.007 to
0.015 mm of the layer is removed as a function of the brush pressure force on the
boards. Experience indicates that a clearance of 1.1 to 1.2 mm is needed to main-
tain high quality of scrubbing of boards with a thickness of 1.5 mm

Preface

At the present time the scientific and technological revolution is posing tasks in
the solution of which a. need arises to exchange practically instantaneously infor-
mation between man and machine.

Therefore much attention is now given to the creation of multi-program interactive
operating systems for the third-generation Yes computers now very widespread [31%,35].
Such systems must simplify and eliminate the adjustment and modification of scien-

ti fic experimental problem programs. and also programs for the automation of produc-
tion processes. must allow the application of new progressive procedures during their
creation and maximally consider distinctive features of the creative activity of a
programmer-developer during communication with a machine. The present book is mainly
devoted to description of the interactive system PAILADA. created and introduced by
the author at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology of the
USSR Academy of Sciences, which facilitates the operation and considerably expands
the possibilities of the disk operating system of the res computer system (DOS Yes),
for the standard Yes DOS system, by virtue of certain of its limitations, proved to
be very inconvenient for the organization of operative external control of the com-
puter program in the course of the execution of programs and especially during the
debugging of large and complex tasks. a. specific feature of which is assuring bilat—
eral exchange of information with an experimental living object. its reception.

analysis on a real time scale and control of the object in accordance with the re-
sults of analysis.

Although the interactive system was intended originally to solve only such problems, in
the process of multiple modiﬁcations it acquired a universal character and is com-

pletely applicable at any computer center engaged in the development and modification
of software.

The main merit of the developed system is the possibility of using a computer with

a minimum or limited set of peripherals and a shortage of the main memory in a regime
of multi-programming with arbitrary switching of sectional priorities. The formation
of a program task in a man-machine interactive regimes, simplicity of work with com-
puter libraries on direct—access devices and the presence of a powerml system micro-
generator permits users during the development of program complexes or systems widely
used progressie principle of module programming. and also a problem-oriented micro-
language.

The material in the book is arranged so that it can serve simultaneously as educational
and reference aids not only for use in the corresponding interactive system but also
during operation of the Dw YeS in a scientific research computer center.

A similar account of the original material together with a description of the necess-
ary positions of the DOS Yes. the selection of nontrivial methods of programming and
new system meroinstructions developed by the authors on a large number of examples
permits hoping tint the book will be useful not only to qualified but also to begin-
ing users.

The author feels it his duty to express sincere gratitude and appreciation to N. I.
Vekshina. Doctor of Biological Sciences 1. A. Shevelev. Candidate of Physical and
Mathematical Sciences A. A. Frolov and Candidate of Technical Sciences A. Ya. Dudin.
who read the manuscript and made valuable comments on improvement of the procedure
in presenting material and also associates of the sections of computer software of
the Scientific Research Institute of Electronic Computers, which rendered invaluable
consultative help in developing the interactive system.

The author will receive with thanks all the practical comments and suggestions which
the readers of the book will consider it necessary to make.

Conclusion

The possibilities of the DOS operating system for YeS computers are still far from
exhausted. A stimulus for their further improvement is simplicity of operation,
availability. a relatively simple logical structure and economy in comparison with
the OS YeS--a complete operating system. Thus the more economic the operating system,
the more memory of the computer is devoted to problem programs and they can be more
complex while preserVing speed of performance on account of exchange with external
magnetic disk and tape stores. To learn to control a computer during the operation
on it of the DOS YeS system modified by the author is much simpler than during the
operation of the 03 Yes. but it is little inferior to the latter, thanks to the pre-
sence of an internal system microgenerator (absent in the OS). which assures a certain
automation of the programming of large and complex tasks through the use of specialized
micro—languages. and also an interactive regime for the preparation and adjustment of
such tasks. The latter makes it possible to use an interactive system as a system
teaching starting programmers to communicate with a computer.

And finally, the main thing, which must not be forgotten, is tint the nontriviality
of the structure of programs, of the results which can be obtained with their help,
will depend completelv only on the people who create them. on their understanding of
the machine's possibilities, ennthelcnrraetion of the for-ulation of the scientific
or whatever other task. No matter how powerful it is or what all-enveloping possi-

bilities an operating system has, it still is Just an aid in this great and detailed
work.

INTERACTIVE SUBSYSTEH FOR COMPUTER-AIDED PROCESS DESIGN

[Article by engineers I. A. Gladkov, L. G. Nsydich, A. H. Varshavskaya, V. N.
Kudryashov, L. A. Zhdsnovich and H. B. Bokhan]

[Excerpts] An Interactive subsystem for computer-aided process design (ART) that
enables a process engineer to interact online with an "-6000 computer using a
DH-ZOOO display has been developed at the "Terminal" Plant (Vinnitsa).

ﬁlls subsystem includes: DM-ZDOO display modules installed in the places where the
process engineers work, "Consul-260“ keyboard printers (UPK), the “-6000 computer
operating in the mode of interruptions and enabling simultaneous operation of this
and other subsystems, a YeS-SOIZ-Ol magnetic tape storage unit, and a set of soft-
ware and instructions.

The subsystem (fig. 1 [not reproduced]) operates as follows. At his workplace,
the process engineer calls the computer through the DH-ZOOO keyboard. After get-
ting a response, he keys in the codes for the operations and steps needed for the
process in a sequence determined by the process path. The code set is sent in the
format shown in the diagram to the computer processor through communication chan-
nels. The processor reads the table of codes of production operations and steps
from the file of classifiers stored in advance on magnetic tape, and checks the
set of each code and the presence of it in the classifier. If everything is cor-
rect, the display screen shows the text of the production operations and steps in
the required sequence according to the form of the process chart, and the columns
for needed equipment and tools are filled out. While looking over the process text
on the display screen, the process engineer makes additions and refinements in the
areas indicated by the cursor, and if necessary, adjusts or repeats the code set.
[I the process is refined and supplemented, the process engineer keys in the com-
mand to print out the process. The print out is made on a prooess chart form.

The subsystem operates jointly with other subsystems upon an interruption and is
therefore ready for operation at any time..

lhe flowchart described above for the subsystem operation algorithm is implemented
by the "ART" and "KLASS" programs that were developed in the “NEHOKOD language for
the M-6000 control computer system. The program and files take up 10K of storage,
but can be reduced to 8K with slight adjustment.

[Article by S. A. Hyglan]

[Text] The stage of primary conversion of a couplets speech signal (quasianalog,
pre-processor processing of the comlete speech signal or speech-recognition
processing) is objectively necessary because it lakes it possible to underline
the defined properties of the input corplete speech signal (088). greatly reduce
the volume of the css, and thus insure subsequent processing. including identi-
fication of secondary characteristics. in the digital block of the autonoaous
speech signal recognition unit in real time.

Quite a few methods of speech recognition processing have been developed today
for recognizing isolated words of a fixed vocabulary [1, 2]. But analysis of
these methods for completeness (necessity and adequacy) is difficult because
the descriptions of the methods are not consolidated in a uniforn classifica-
tion scheme.

This article gives a generalized methodological scheme for expanding css into
the minimum essential and complete series of informative priaary descriptions
(conversions) of the speech signal. based on analysis of a mathematical model
of the Harkovian random process. The css, as a function of sound pressure p(t).
converted to electrical oscillations u(t ), in view of the conclusions of the
acoustic and articulation theories of recognition [3] can be considered a
Harkovian quasistationary quasiperiodic (semilogarithmic) broad-band random
process modulated by amlitude and phase. Such a process. which is finite in
the amplitude, frequency, and time domain, nay on the basis of [6] be repre-
sented by the following mathematical model:

ult)=U(t)'<oS<p(t), (1)

where UithElVHvJ‘RBK is the envelope (intensity) of the random process.

In this case (r) is linked with «(e) stationary random process (according to
Gilbert); Qlt):m Qﬁﬂyutt» is the phase of the random process: and. d‘ldt
is the instantaneous frequency. Considering the conclusion presented in [4, 7),
let us formulate several remarks concerning model (1).

MOFFIGALIBEONLY
l. The possibility of representing the random process of speech formation in
the form of model (1) does not impose any significant constraints on the enery
spectrum of the process.

2. The most informative frequency range for analysis of the speech signal is
the range BE- 10%: - 10 m.

3. Primary conversion of the CSS in the coordinates "energy-frequency-time"
must be done using a definite type of frequency 51A,“). Ma) and time hu-D win-
dows of the sliding weighted functions of ongoing speech recognition processing
where A and sf are the form and width of the frequency window respectively; 5
is the generalized parameter of the frequency window; ? is the length of the
time window.

Simultaneous separation of two comaents that are informative from the stand-
point of the speech formation process the static component U(t) and the dy-
naaic conponentmﬂt) in convolution (1) can be done by means of two parallel
filters. each of which suppresses (limits to the Iaximum degree) the opposite
component. Although not a completely connect description (conversion) of the
CSS, its spectral-time representation is the rust informative form with re-
spect to these two components [5]. In view of what has been stated above and
on the basis of [7], the speech recognition procedure for primary conversion of
a CSS has the following form:

- . 'Uowuwaru; .

Thus. the speech recognition procedure presupposes independent and parallel de-
termination of three types of estimates of the form (2.3). (2.6), (2.5) for the
CSS. Therefore. we can speak of three types of initial conversion of the CSS
making up the speech recognition procedure: type 1, defined by expressions
(2.l)-(2.3); type 2, defined by expression (2.6); and, type 3, defined by ex-
pression (2.5). in this case an estimate of type (2.3) (speech recognition type
1) is fully informative in problems of identifying the moments of initiation

and completion of an isolated pronounced word, identification of acoustic

pauses within the vord, and identification of sound segments of the CSS (8).

The estimate of type (2.4) (speech recognition type 2) gives a measure of both
the static and dynamic components of the CSS and is fully informative in prob-
lems of identifying vowels (voiced phonemes) and identifying the frequency of
the basic tone (pitch-period) of the CSS [5]. The estimate of type (2.5)
(speech recognition type 3) is the most informative of the types considered and
permits identification of both tonal and noise segments of the css on the basis
of representation of their fine structure [5. 6]. It should be noted that
speetu recognition type 1 has a number of additional characteristics in compari-
son with types 2 and 3, specifically:

I. it achieves invariance of estimates Ag (t) in relation to the changing in-
tensity of the speech signal.

2. It achieves a certain level of noise suppression by maximum amplitude limi-
tation of both the usable signal and noise.

The quantity i}, 71' and 1, in expressions (2. 3), (2.6), and (2.5) respectively

are determined by the upper syllabic frequency Fc 330 ha of the speech sounds
(phonemes) and the length of the stationary and transitional segments, the pitch-
period of the 088. In the most common cases of pro-processor processing 1, - 10 ms
and 797; 20 ms.

In conformity with (2.l)-(2.5), hard-are realization of the quasianalog block for
speech recognition processing presupposes the organization of three independent,
parallel channels to receive compact information on the CSS and feed it to the
digital block of the autonomous speech signal recognition unit. that is. channel
1. 2. and 3 that carry out speech recognition types 1, 2. and 3 respectively.

In this case the output of channels 2 and 3 are joined through a commutator and
PNK [expansion unknown}. Channels 1. 2, and 3 can be realized using a digital
frequency meter [8], an analog integrator based on an R8 aversger [7]. and the
comb of three-octave nlresidence analog filters [6] respectively. In this case,
21 filters are needed to overlap the band D“ in other vords'l- 21. In design
terms. this comb can be realized as the series-produced P3P-80 spectrum ana-
lyzer and also active series 298 RC—filters using domestically produced micro-
circuits.

In conclusion we must observe that pro—processor processing of s css in the
quasianalog block of an autonomous speech signal recognition unit based on the
above-described speech recognition procedure is outstanding for its flexibility

and universality. It can be realized generally using series-produced assemblies
of both analog and digital computer equipment. In this case an estimate of type

(2.5) using Parseval's theorem [6] takes on the meaning of various particular

methods of primary description of the conplete speech signal, for example the
format method [5].

"Tasks or the First Section of the EU in the Oka Central Territorial
Administration of $33 Gossnab"]

[Excerpts] The nnsu [Scientific-Research Institute of Control Systems] and
the 0ka Central Supply Administration developed, and in November 1980 commis-
sioned, an automated control system for material and technical supply in the
Olta River area. The development of the ASU in the 01:9. Central Territorial
Administration was regarded as a model element in the ASU 0: [BER Gossnab,
which is why most of the problems and subsystem; were oriented on model
proJect solutions (TPR) and standard programs.

The first section or the ASU includes the following functional subsystems:
determination of demand for products, drawing up balance sheets and distribu-
tion plans, establishment of economic ties, monitoring deliveries, control of
reserves of material resources, planning and fiscal activity, bookkeeping and
accounting, control of cargo handling processes. Each subsystem consists of
problems sharing a common economic essence and utilizing the same data soft-
ware. The basic elements of the system's hardware are two 38-1022 computers.

For the convenience of users, a system or output of data about stock inven-
tories on display terminals was developed. 0n the suggestion of users, during

the solution of the task of recording and controlling aggregate stocks on the
basis of statistical report forms 1-81! and 2-SN, work was done to rearrange
the column widths in all ledgers. To assure control ove - violations of fiscal

discipline by construction organizations, provisions have been made to add a
new column to outgoing ledgers: ”Supply of products to enterprises and organ-
izations of other ministries (departments) on their orders". Reports on the
movement of products in the most important products lists are forwarded to
the lSSR Gossnab; therefore, to reduce the labor needed to prepare this
information provisions have been made for its output on punched tape.

Introduction of the A80 of the Oka Central Territorial Administration on the
basis of the Unified Computer System began in conditions when the Computer
Center was already using “Minsk-22" computers for solving a sufficiently wide
range of problems for all the Central Administration's specialized administrae
tions. This necessitated the solution of a number of problems involving the
transition to new hardware incompatible with that formerly used. The transi-
tion is proceeding normally thanks to detailed planning of efficient sequences
of problem input, transfer of information files from computer to computer,

and of the sequence of selecting the units to be transferred to the new
unified products classifier. All computer centers going over to the use of
the Unified Computer System will face similar problems in one form or another.

Much attention was given to questions of the authenticity and completeness of
the data processed by the unified Computer System, and control over data input
and transmission from the users to the computer center and back has been
considerably enhanced. An important prerequisite for this was the replacement
of formal methods of control (of the correspondence of the computer medium to
the document) with control of the correctness of reflection of the economic
operation in the document itself by logically comparing individual elements of
the information files (commodity code and listed price, planned and actual
delivery, etc.).

The estimated economic effect deriving from the introduction of problems of
the first stage of the ASU of the Cka Central Territorial Administration is
555,700 rubles.

The main factors of economic effectiveness are: timely supply of consumers
with material resources, drawing extranonmative territorial resources into
the economic turnover, acceleration of turnover of working capital, reduction
or the labor-intensivity of data processing, and streamlining the management
of material and technical supply. Some of the tasks of the described system
are currently being duplicated in a number of organizations of the USSR State
Supply Committee.

Moldavian SSR Oossnab, and V. P. Polun, department chief at the Computer
Center of Moldavian SSR Gossnab]

[Text] The computer center of Moldavian SSR Gossnab has developed a complex
or problems, "Control of Product Supply”, using the "Minsk-32" and 23-1022
computers, which is being introduced in subordinate organisations of Gossnab.
The problems include:

drawing up plans of supply of products to warehouses of Moldavian SSR Gossnab
and customers in the republic by the warehouse and transit form of delivery;

control of deliveries of products frcn wholesale bases of mldavian SSR
Gossnab;

control of transit deliveries of products to customers in the republic (for
organizations participating in customer-supplier accounts);

control of the meeting of contract comitments for warehouse deliveries to
customers in the republic;

preparation of acceptance invoices for transmittal to warehouses in the system
of Moldavian SSR Gossnab.

According to the accepted classification of problems, the first and last prob-
lens are not directly connected with delivery control and were included in the
complex because they have no independent significance or are ineffective
separately from it. The five basic output forms obtained in the problem

complex correspond to forms developed by the computer center of the
"Mosgormetallosnabsbyt" [Moscow City ktals Supply and Sales organization]
and recommended for introduction at all computer centers in ISSR Gossnah
system.

The other four basic output forms and the principal part of the proJeet were
developed independently. In particular, the forms include a "Ledger of Funds
Realization" for groups of fund-holders (warehouse and transit deliveries) and
a "ledger or Products Deliveries to the Republic" according to suppliers
(warehouse and transit deliveries) classified in groups.

The complex's software includes four load modules (programs) in the input
language COBOL of the "Minsk-32" computer. The primary intonation is punched.
in according to two basic patterns (data on delivery plans and information
about suppliers' payment requirements). The classifiers provide for all
attributes needed for the hmctioning of planning problems, bookkeeping and
accounting, etc. , and are therefore cannon for the whole system. Incoming
intonation is processed at the computer center and fed into the computer
daily as it arrives.

The project was tested in the Holdmetallosnabsbyt [mldavian Metals Supply and
Sales] Administration and is currently being introduced in the Holdtara
[container] and Moldpriborsnabsbyt [instrument supply and sales] administra-
tions. In the latter, data processing is done on an 3-1022 computer and the
software is packaged in the Unified System's operating system.

[Text] The Leningrad Institute of Railroad Transportation Engineers has an
assignment from the Soyuzglavnei‘t', [Petroleum] Administration of the USSR
Gossnab to streamline the transportation of petroleum products. An analysis
of monthly operational production plans revealed considerable variations in
them. The greatest changes in the formation of assortment programs occur in
planning the production or grade 5-72 motor gasoline. 28-1033 computers were
used at the Computer Center of the Oktyabr'skaya Railroad to estimate 17
optimal plans according to monthly plan indices: 12 monthly, four quarterly
and one annual. A comparison of the actual and optimal operational plans for
A-‘IZ gasoline revealed that the mean haulage distance [HID] varies consider-
ably from month to month according to changes in production plans.

Thus, in June the actual ﬂiD was 1.7 times higher than in Rovember and December.
Changes in assortment programs lead to an even greater increase in the HID of
gasoline. In this connection we think it necessary to have a numerical esti-
mate of the effect of the nonuniformity of monthly transportation plans on the
mm. For this we drew up optimal quarterly and annual transportation plans in
which the nonuniformity of operational planning was eased by summing over the
volumes of resources and consumption month by month.

The easing of the monthly nonuniformity of plans of refining grade A-TZ gaso-
line will lead to a reduction in the freight turnover of railroad transports-
tion by h89,000,000 t/km, which in cash terms would mean a reduction in
transportation costs of 1,500,000 rubles per year.

Machinery-v]

[Text] The organization "VH1 Zbroyovka" (Czechoslovakia), which engages in
supply and sales of farm machinery, has introduced a dialoguegtype automated
information system (AIS).

The inventory of the supply and sales organization includes 120,000 items
(farm machines and spare parts for then). It has 800 suppliers and 10,000
customers. The organization has 120 wholesale centers with a network of
warehouses, which handle some 25,000 sale operations daily. Every year the
organization concludes sane 1,500 contracts for the supply of products, with
the number of items reaching 200,000.

The AIS hardware includes an 101. 10/50 computer with an internal storage capac-
ity or 256 kbytes and an external storage capacity or uXSO Hbytes. In the
ﬁxture, as the AIS develops, a network of local terminals will be added for

real-time processing of current information. Data recorded by the indexed-
sequential method are stored on a magnetic disk. The body or data is currently
200 Mbytes and will subsequently be increased to 1600-600 bytes.

All the AIS software is recorded in the algorithmic language COBOL and has a
module structure. The was system was adopted as the universal software for
controlling the data base as being the most suitable one for the requirements
of the AIS. In future the IDIB system will also most likely be used with
machines or the Unified system of Electronic Computers.

56

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
The central data base of the AIS comprises the following indexed-sequential
data sets: price-list of products, list of farm machines, directory of com-
mercial outlets, directory of customers and suppliers, business contracts,
items in business contracts divided by quarters, contacts between suppliers
and customers, warehouse stocks and their movement.

Successful introduction of the AIS was facilitated by the following distribu-
tion of responsibilities during its development and introduction: designing
the system as a whole, designing the data base, elaborating specifications,
analysis and programming methods, coordination of designing work and norma-
tive control, adjustment and tuning up the AIS to optimal operating conditions.

The development of the AIS began in 1976 and it was ready for industrial
operation in the 2nd quarter of 1980.

[Article by T. N. Ryzhova, instructor, Central Board of the Scientific and
Technical Society of the Instrument Making Industry. "Competition Results")

[Excerpt] The Central Board of the Scientific and Technical Society of the
instrument Making Industry imeni Academician S. I. Vavilov has approved the re-
sults of the annual competition for the S. I. Vavilov prizes for development of
instruments, units and systems for scientific research for 1980.

Participating in the competition were author groups from a number of research and
development organizations. industrial enterprises and VUZ's engaged in instrument
development for scientific research.

First prize was awarded to the author group (I. Ya. Shtral', S. Ye. Aronina, P. K.
Cherednichenko and V. I. Timoshenko, Experimental Design Office for Automation,
"Khimavtomatika" NPO [Chemical Automation Scientific Production Association],
Moscow) for the "Basic Software and Hardware System for Automating Chemical
Process Research Systems" (BPTK).

Developed in this complex for the first tune is a series of standard units and
modules designed to develop specific automated systems for all types of chemical
process research: from kinetics on the molecular level to the efficiency of process
solutions on fragments of the technological process. In the development of the
complex. the ideology of the international modular CAHAC system was extended for
the first time to an electropneumatic system. The complex supplements the state
system of instruments and computer hardware in the area of parameters specifically
for chemical process research, including mini and micro flow rates, and it permits
analyzing local characteristics of corrosive and dispersive media and measuring
nonstationsry phyisicochemical parameters. The complex permits solving the follow-
ing problems by using computer hardware: creating flows of matter and energy in
objects as well as controlled disturbances (software control), stabilizing and
monitoring the operating mode, monitoring object response to disturbances, record-
ing information. performing proximate analysis of experiment results, solving pri-
mal and inverse problems of modeling the process being studied, planning and eval-
uating experiments and performing discrimination of hypotheses advanced by the
researcher in the form of models of the process being studied.

The modular design of the complex provides the capability of online acquisition and
reconfiguration of a system for Performing research on a broad class of chemical
processes, which is feasible because of the use in the Basic Software and hardware
System for Automating Chemical Process Research Systems of common standardized
hardware, interactive software systems at all levels, and computer hardware in a
unified hierarchical system

Second prizes were awarded to author groups at the Special Design Office for Gas
Chromatography at the Moscow "Manometr" P0 [Production Association] (V. M.
Poshemanskiy, V. N. Chernyakin, V. I. Romanov, A. E. Ventsel' and M. A. Kurtsman)
for the work "'Khrustal' 5002' Chromatograph" and at the Moscow Institute of
Electronic Control Machines (8. N. Khrushchev, S. S. Partsevskiy, V. N. Pokudov,

V. P. Khomyak and A. A. Marchuk) for the work, "Development and Introduction into
Series Production of the IVK-Z Measuring-Computing Complex." They were accomplished
at a high scientific and technical level, are original and have made a substantial
contribution to the development of science and technology.

The "Khrustal' 5002“ chromatograph is a general-purpose fully automated instrument
designed to perform selective highly sensitive analysis of five classes of organic
compounds in a broad range of concentrations. The chromatograph has 40 models
differing in the set of detectors, facilities for automation of analysis and those
for automatic information processing. Gas chromatographic analysis can be performed
with the "Khrustal' 5002" chromatograph at temperatures to 650°C, which also

extends by far the capabilities of the instrument compared to similar domestic and
foreign chromatographs. The instrument has extensive application in performing
scientific research in the field of the environment in various sectors of the
national economy.

The iVK—Z measuring-computing complex is a problem-oriented complex of the SH EVM
[System of Small Computers] and was developed to automate scientific experiments
performed by general physical methods. Application of the complex in systems for
automation of scientific experiments allows a considerable enhancement in quality
and reduction in time for completing the experiment and affords the capability of
qualitatively new types of experiments to study and research rather complex objects.
The complex effects reception, recording. processing and output of experimental
Information in real time. The modular design of the complex allows the user to
modify the configuration of the complex applicable to the experiment. The basic
software includes standard operating systems, programs for operating with CAMAC
devices in a high-level language, and test and metrological software. The IVK-Z
complex has been assimilated and is in series production by the Kiev
"lbtholektropribor" P0 [Production Association].

Introduction

At today's stage of development, the mechanization and automation of produc-
tion on the basis of wide use of modern computer technology is becoming more
and more important. Analysis of the practices involved in the design and
operation of computer centers and collective use computer centers testifies
to the fact that the greatest bottleneck inthetechnological mode of opera-

tion of information processing is the preparation and checking of data on com-
puter information carrying media.

run urraum um:- with].

If, in the process of development, computers have gone through four generan
tions, from vacuum tube computers to large-scale integrated circuit multi-
processors which make it possible to handle tens of millions of operations a
second, then the preparation and checking of data on perforated media have
lagged behind them to a significant degree. At the present time, devices and
systems are being developed for preparing and checking data on magnetic tape.
This tape will be ready for direct input into the computer at a rate more
than ten times faster than data input from traditional punched cards and tape.

Such developments are going on in our nation, as well as abroad. The result
of such developments in our nation has been the adoption in our computer cen-
ters of an automated system for preparing data on magnetic tape of the
spa—9000 type, as well as of themes-9001 devices for preparing data on
magnetic tape. These make it possible to write information on magnetic tape
in the codes of the Yes, as well as the "Minsk-32" computer.

Our nation is successfully using equipment and systems for preparing data on
magnetic information carrying media made by member-nations of CEMA. These
include: the Yes-9002 device for preparing data on magnetic tape, the Yes-9003
automated system for preparing data on magnetic tape, the YeS-900h device for
preparing data on magnetic tape, the Yes-9112 device for preparing data on
floppy disks and others.

Literature on the issues considered in this book is virtually non-existent.
Thus, the goal of this book is to fill in this gap and to do an adequate Job
of fully covering issues involving the preparation of data on computer media
during the course oftne technological mode of operation of information
processing in the compiter center.

This book consists . lour chapters.

Chapter 1 reveals the basic technological stages of information processing in
the computer center. The general structure of this production process is
considered. In connection with this, information is briefly given providing
rules for the requester to follow in preparing and filling out primary docu-
ments and regarding the reception, recording and checking of information in
the appropriate subdivision of the computer center, preparation and checking
of punched cards, punched tape and magnetic tape, information processing by
the computer, etc. This knowledge is essential to computer center operators
and technicians if they are to have a correct understanding of the execution
of information processing in the computer center.

Chapter 2 is devoted to the description of the features of computer informa-

tion carrying media: punched cards, punched tape, magnetic tape and disks. A
comparative description is made of these computer information carrying media,

68

noting the advantages and shortcomings of each. Such information is very
important in planning the computer processing of economic information and in
a rational selection of the most appropriate information carrying media.
Rules for coding information on punched cards and tapes are given for the
codes of the "Minsk-32" (603T 10859—6h) and Yes (608T l3052-7h) computers and
in international code no 2. These are essential to operators for determining
the reliability of input information.

Chapter 3 considers issues involving the preparation of data on punched card
and tape information media. Operating procedures are given for operators
using the UPIX (Device for Preparation of Data on Punched Cards) and UPDL
(Device for Preparation of Data on Punched Tape) "Brest-l" for the "Minsk-32"
computer and also various devices for preparing punched cards and tape for
the Yes computer; namely: PABO-2/3M, KABO-2/3M, Yes-9020 and "Prepamat". A
technical description of features is given for the Yes-9080 and "Zoyemtron-
hls,h25" devices for the preparation and checking of data on punched cards,
the Yes-9011 and Yes-9017 devices for marking and interpreting information on
punched cards and also for the YeS-902h device for preparing data on punched
tape. Rules for punching programs in algorithmic languages for the "Minsk-32"
computer (YaSK, c0301.) and Yes computers (PL-l, Assembler, FORTRAN, COBOL)
are considered. Various methods of quality control for the preparation of
punched media are expounded.

The last chapter, chapter h, contains information on the preparation of data
on magnetic information carrying media. Our nation's first automated system
for preparing data on magnetic tape, the SPD-9000, its components, the struc-
ture of its hardware and software and its techniques fer preparing and check-
ing data are considered. Data processing on the SPD-9000 by means of a
package of application programs, which represents the furthest development of
the program capacities of the systems, is considered separately. The package
of application programs is designed for auxiliary processing of data: data
checking by means of horizontal and vertical data balance, data checking on
the basis of modulus, use of limiting values to check data, data copying

and editing, transformation of data structures, printing data on the teletype
and alphanumeric printing systems, etc.

A package of programs has been put to a wide range of practical applications
in the computer centers of the scientific-production association ASU (Auto-
mated System of Control) "Pbskva". The package already contains 18 programs,
in the incorporation of which the author of this book has participated. At
present, the systems package of application programs is still being added to.
Thirty examples are cited to demonstrate the most frequently encountered tasks
in auxiliary data processing using the application programs package.

This chapter also contains information on data preparation on the Yes-9001
device. In addition, it briefly considers the Yes-9002, Yes-9003, YeS-900h,

Yes-9006, Yes-9112, Yes-91123, Yes-9150 and SPD—9000M devices and systems for
preparing data on magnetic media.

Each disk surface contains 203 concentric tracks, on which information is
written. The tracks are numbered from 0 (on the outer edge of the disk) to

202 (at its center). The capacity of each track is 3625 bytes and the capacity
of the whole pack is 7.25 million bytes. 0f the 203 tracks, 200 are for data
and the remaining ones are service tracks. Ten tracks of the pack with the
same number make up a cylinder, the capacity of which is 36,250 bytes. Writing
and reading of information is done by magnetic heads using a sequential code

within the bounds of one cylinder, after which the process goes on to the next
cylinder.

Disk packs may be denounted and stored for the next use like reels of magnetic
tape.

Yes-5261 Disk Pack. In the Yes-5261 removable disk pack, operating with the
NMD Yes-5061, there are 20 working disk surfaces, located on 11 aluminum disks
with ferromagnetic coating. Each oftheworking surfaces consists of 203 com-
centric tracks (200 working, 3 back-up).

Each set of 20 tracks with the same number forms an information cylinder, so
that a pack has 203 concentric cylinders. Each cylinder is served by 20
floating magnetic heads.

Basic parameters of the pack:

Maximum memory size: - 29.116 . 106 bytes;
Maximum packed density - 88 impulses/Ia;
Rate of data transmission - 312 Kbytes/sec.

3.3. PREPARATION OF DATA FOR PROCESSING IN THE YeS COMPUTER

To prepare data on punched cards and tape for the Yes computer, computer cen-

ters currently use devices manufactured in our nation as well as in member-
nations of SEMA.

0f the domestically manufactured devices for preparing and checking numeric
and alphanumeric information on punched cards and tapes, only those are used
where the infonnation codes correspond to the Yes computer code in 608T
13052-7h. These include the PA80-2/3M, KA80-2/3H, Yes-9011 and Yes-9017, the
most common devices for the preparation and checking of data on punched cards
and the Yes-9020 and Yes-902R for punched tape.

In our nation, we also successfully use devices for preparing data on punched
media which are manufactured in the member nations of SEMA. These include
the Yes-9080 devices for preparing data on punched cards and the "Zoyemtron-
h15,h25" card punches and verifiers madeillGDR, and the "Prepamat" devices
for preparing data on punched tape made in the Hungarian People's Republic
and others.

[Text] Annotation

This book reviews techniques of automated control of the fundamental operations
of thermal technology (metalization and soldering of ceramic assemblies, heat
treatment of semiconductor structures. annealing, and so on) and vacuum-
technological and galvanic processes, automated assembly and installation of
the electrodes of generator instruments, and automated roentgenostroboscopic
monitoring of the stability of shape of the design elements of electronic
instruments.

The book is intended for workers in the electronics industry and related sec-
tors who are specializing in electronic and radio instrument building and in
development of automated control systems for industrial processes [ASUTP's].

Preface

The prime cost of electronic instruments, their reliability, simplicity of
production, and the time spent on their manufacture depend significantly on
technology. when working out the technological process, therefore, primary
efforts must be directed to organizing production to raise labor productivity
and increase the production of articles per unit of production equipment not
only by refining and organizing technology, but also by automating control
based on optimization of industrial (technological) processes.

One of the main directions in optimization of the technology of manufacturing

the parts of electronic equipment is developing and introducing computer-based
ASUTP's in production. This has become possible owing to the availability of

highly productive and precise modern equipment and the development of a broad

assortment of means of mechanizing and automating data processing.

FOR1OFFHJAI.USE(NNLY
The complexity of the Industrial processes, the type of production, and the
amount and diversity of industrial and monitoring equipment to produce electronic

parts determine what difficulties there will be in setting up systems to control
industrial processes.

Efficiency of control over increasingly complex industrial processes is achieved
by constantly searching for more favorable conditions for these processes on the

basis of operational data processing concerning their state and a correct
strategy of process control.

The designated purposes of the A801? in the electronics industry are as follows
[76]:

a. monitoring industrial operations by means of a controlling
machine;

b. optimization of the industrial process by means of automated
monitoring with control feedback;

c. determining the effect of changes in the industrial process

on the quality of output and the percentage of usable parts
produced;

d. raising labor productivity in assembly and monitoring opera-
tions.

It is advisable to use ASUTP's in places where industrial processes are continuous
and the productivity of the industrial equipment is quite high. These factors
are indicative for the technology of producing electronic instruments.

The endeavor to improve the technical-economic indicators of industrial processes
by control means necessitates modernization. and in many cases also a signifi-
cant reorganization of the structure of industrial operations and equipment.
Experience shows that the development of control systems for complex industrial
processes goes through three stages [77].

l. Formulating the controlled and observed industrial process. In this stage the
industrial process is shaped as an object of control. The characteristics of the
parts being made can be modified by controlling the industrial process. There-
fore. it is essential to work out an optimal structure and method of realizing

the industrial process that insures efficiency of control, to build industrial
equipment that is appropriate to the resulting structure of the process. to equip

it with data sensors and actuating devices, and to organize the necessary infor-
mation flows.

2. Construction of mathematical models and algorithms of control over industrial
processes. Industrial processes in electronics engineering are complex control

objects whose state depends on many factors which frequently cannot be monitored.
Efficient control of such processes is only possible where the basic patterns that

characterize them and the relations between input and output parameters of the
process have been studied and represented in the form of mathematical models
that reflect the static and dynamic characteristics of the process. Mathew
matical models are the foundation for formulating the algorithms of control

of the industrial process, that is, for formalization of decisionvmaking on con-
trolled shaping of the characteristics of parts and indicators of their pro-
duction. The algorithm put into the optimizing ASUTP is the only means of con-
tinuously insuring a search for the optimal Hay to raise the productivity of

the process and improve the quality of the product being made. Formulation of a
mathematical model of the process that reflects its static properties makes it
possible to select the optimal industrial regime and work out the algorithm for
control of the process of shaping the characteristics of parts "on the average"
[33]. The mathematical model that reflects the dynamic properties of the
process makes it possible to work out an algorithm to modify the industrial
regime to compensate for the effect of unmonitored factors on the process of
shaping the characteristics of the articles. Continuous modification of the
industrial regime greatly diminishes the variation in characteristics of ar-
ticles at the output of the process and insures stability under conditions of
series production.

1. Development of the hardware of the system, its particular elements. installa-
tion. and comprehensive debugging of the ASUTP. Experience shows that the first
two stages may take up the 75 percent of total development time for the ASUTP.

The present book reviews the questions of optimizing industrial processes and
constructing formalized models of them for machine control. It tells abOut
methods of constructing ASUTP's and gives specifications on ASUTP's that have
been developed. The book reviews the basic industrial processes of producing
electronic instruments.
