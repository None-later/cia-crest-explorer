media and magnetic heads. In the process, even in vacuum deposition equip-est
series produced by domestic industry [36], obtaining up'to a hundred or more
integrated heads on one substrate in one processing cycle is attainable.

In addition to s high degree of integration and suitability to manufacture of mag-
netic heads, integrated

ty and very small weight and dimensions. One should not think however that inte-
grated technology in the immediate future will exclude heads with solid mass cores
from application. Preference for application of a particular technology will be

tions into account of course. The fact is, in particular, that the chief diffi-
culty in manufacturing solid mass cores-obtaining effective gaps-can be overcome

Examples of heads with helical erticulations of half-cores are shown in fig. 10.

The head in fig. lOe consists of two 2
c~shaped cores 1 and 2. Core 1, made of
magnetically soft material, has helical
surface 3 that fully matches the lower .3
surface of core 2. Face surface 4 of ,

tightly together, as a result of which a ring magnetic circuit is formed. _The
cores can be metallic or ferrite. The head in fig. 10b consists of two flat plates
5 and 6 which have the shape of an opened ring. The rings are curved in a helical
,curve. Compared to previous designs, the advantage of this one is that head dimen-
sions in width are not at all restricted and can be made quite small. Such a head.
while keeping the advantage of a ring solid mass magnetic circuit, approximates

the integrated in its properties.

Area of Application of Integrated Beads. Since magnetic recording has now ettered
into essentially all spheres of human activity and its characteristics are starting
to noticeably affect the rates of scientific and technical progress, it is expected
that the demand for integrated heads will increase. The clearest examples of the
use of the technology of recording on a magnetic medium are the uses of studio
audio and video magnetic tape recorders in radio and television, astronomy and
astrophysics. space technology and aviation, computer technology, defectoscopy,
automation and remote control, measuring technology, etc. [1, 38-40]. The rapid
development of electronic computers, automated control systems and data banks
caused an insistent need for development and improvement of storage equipment in
the form of disk, drum and tape units. In these devices, magnetic heads are major
components, along with the electronics, media and moving mechanisms.

Since these systems operate with digital information, pulse recording methods, re-
quiring the use of pulse magnetic heads. are used in the storage units. Under the
conditions of mass production of them, integrated technology is the most preferred,
for the manufacture of the basic elements of large computers is very consistent
with thin-film technology. In the process, because of the rapid wear of integrated
heads when there is contact with the recording medium, they are applied mainly in
units of heads of the floating type, which ensures noncontact recording.

Integrated technology permits organizing mass output of heads with such high char-
acteristics that this has an immediate effect on the overall characteristics of

the equipment in which they are used I29, 61]. Thus, for example, the use of inte-
grated heads in disk storage units led to a 2.5-fold reduction in disk diameters
and also a reduction in costs for storing the information coming into the units
i421. Media with narrower magnetic tracks, as well as the combined design of a
magnetic head and integrated amplifier for reproduction permit in this case
eliminating a large share of the noise and adjustments.

Extensive possibilities have been opened in measuring technology in connection with
the application of integrated magnetoresistive heads as highly sensitive probes for
research of magnetic fields. Here they are competitive with Hall sensors. Also
expected is the use of magnetoresistive heads in devices for numeric program control
of metal-cutting tools, where ilow-sensitive heads substantially simplify the
structure of the control units.

* k t

Hany foreign corporations and firms are now beginning to seriously consider
magnetoresistive heads and especially their integrated forms. The capital invest-
ment in research to improve the new type of sensors and develop more progressive
manufacturing technology for them is steadily growing. A large number of patents
have appeared for magnetoresistive heads and new technology for deposition and
magnetic electroplating. Considerable advances are expected in the technology of
recording analog information by digital methods based on using integrated heads,
metallized tapes and integrated amplification technology.

2
FORiOFFKJAl.USE(NVLY
Introducing thin-film technology into the production of magnetic heads is yielding
the following advantages:

the frequency response of the "reccrding-reproduction" path is being improved
because the heads are made in the form of a laminated structure of films with mag-
netic orientation, which provides good flux linkage between the winding and
operating gap,

longitudinal recording density is being increased because of the improvement in
the shape (geometry) of the head magnetic field,

lateral recording density with precise bounds between magnetic tracks is being
increased,

high head reliability and durability are being achieved because of the structural
integrity, standardized manufacturing technology and application of new materials,
high suitability to manufacture is being achieved which provides for deposition

of hundreds and thousands of heads in one cycle, and

the cost of the products is declining under the conditions of mass automated head
production.

Also, the magnetoresistive effect combined with integrated technology makes it
possible to substantially reduce the size and weight of storage devices while
keeping their high reliability. All these considerations demand a serious attitude
toward the development of the new important direction in storage technology and

the performance of profound scientific research investigations.

INTENSITY AMPLIFIERS FOR OPTICAL INSTRUIENTS

Moscow VESTNIK AKADBHII “AUX SSSR in Russian No 2, Feb 82 pp 66-75

[Article by G. G. Petrash.‘ doctor of physical and mathematical sciences]

[Excerpts] The extensive application of amplifiers in optical instruments could
lead to revolutionary transformations in instrument optics. .

There has been recent intensive research on various methods for recovering the

wave front with the aid of nonlinear interactions in various mediums. In some
versions of the method it is possible to recover the wave front through amplification.
As far as is known by the author of this article. these amplifying methods have

still not been used in optical instruments. The difficulty in using then is
associated in particular with the fact that extremely high powers are required

to effect nonlinear conversions.

The first laser mircoprojector was built in 1972 in the optical laboratory of the
USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of Physics imsni P.“ Lebedev. The asplifying
element of a laser based on copper vapor was used as the asplifier. Measurements
showed that the amplifier made it possible to amplify the intensity of light beams
carrying the image of a microscopic object by a factor of several hundred to more
than 10,000. Maxim amplification is achieved with mini-1m power for brightening
the object. As the strength of the beam increases the amplifier approaches
saturation and amplification falls off. Here it was possible to use a considerable
part of the energy stored in the amplifying medium man power in the exit bea-
ftom the microprojector was only several times less than in a laser with the same
amplifier, at 1.5-2.5 w. This power is adeQuate to obtain an insge of a microscopic
object on a screen measuring 25 sq. meters. When a microscopic object enlarged

by a factor of eight was used. the linear increase on the screen exceeded 10.000.
These results lie far beyond the possibilities of normal microprojectors. here

the amplifying element had no marked distortions and the resolution of the instrument

was not impaired.

Later other pulsed lasers operating on metal vapors were used as the intensity
amplifiers in microprojectors. It turned out that all the amplifiers tested nade

it possible to obtain significant and efficient amlification (some characteristics
are shown in a table). Brightness-intensified imges of a microscopic object without
marked distortions were obtained with all amplifiers in various spectral fields. '

New models of industrial versions of laser microprojectors for use mainly in
microelectronics. have now been developed. In these instruments provision has
been made for a facility to emloy treatment by a laser beam focused on an object
in a snail spot (down to 1 micrometer) with continuoua:l monitoring of the treatuent

process on a screen.

Optical systems with intensity amplifiers still constitute a quite new field of
optics. It is. therefore. at present difficult to assess their possibilities and
problems that may arise in development. Nevertheless. already the great future
foreseen for optical systems with intensity amplifiers can be assessed.

There are now high-resolution photographic materials that mks it possible to
record high-quality images on a small area. The use of these materials can
substantially reduce the area of the frame in motion films. This would lead to
a sharp drop in demand for cine film and silver. which is in short supply. and
would reduce the size of cinematographic equip-mt. however. given the present
projection equipment. it is not possible to do this because the light loads on
the film during projection onto a screen are already extremely great. The use
of intensity amplifiers could provide a radical solution to this problem.

Definite prospects have also been opened up for developing new systems for projecting
television. The use of an intensity amplifier in projection would make it possible
to substantially reduce the light load on the information medium. which in this

case could be a controlled reflector or diapositive. In principle. in this case.

too. the size of the information medium, controlled, for example. by microelectronics.
could be reduced to down to l micromter. and adequate illumination on the screened

would be obtained by intensity amplifiers of the required sizes.

Yet another possibility that could already be developed relatively simply is to
take photomicrographs at a fram speed of 10-20 kHz. For this. all that is required
is to scan in til: the imges received at the amplifier output. since the duration
of imge reproduction for lasers now in use is 10-30 nanoseconds.

Of course, great opportunities also exist for the development of laser microprojectors.
The various versions of microprojectors with intensity amplifiers still need to

be worked out: polarized and interference microscopes. stereomicroscopea. system

with phase contrast and so forth. The possibility exists of considerably improving
methods for mircotreatment with a laser beam with monitoring on the screen of the

microp rojector .

Great possibilities for the use of the intensity auplifier are also being opened

up for infrared technology. Within the IR spectral range it is easier to obtain
sufficiently high amplification, and therefore realisation of these amplifiers

should be simple. In this spectral range. for example. it is easier to build an
amplifier that operates in continuous mode, or an amplifier with a broad amplification
band. 0n the other hand. the visualization of infrared images present great
difficulties which would be much easier to overcome if the image were formed by

a beam of sufficient power. and here it is possible to used a low-salsitivity
Visualizer of nonlinear conversions.

Attractive possibilities for using intensity amplifiers exist in holography. The
use of the amplifiers in recording of holograms would make it possible to use

6

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
low-sensitivity recording medium or sharply reduce recording time. At the stage

of reproduction the amplifiers would make it possible to substantially reduce the

light load on the hologram and it would be possible to use holograms with low
diffractive efficiency, retaining high intensity at the output thanks to anplification.
This could turn out to be especially iuportant for dyannic holography.

The list of prospects for the development of optical systems with intensity
amplifiers, and the problens occurring in their development and extensive spread
could. of course. be continued. but what has been said is enough to conclude that
these prospects are very interesting and that it is tine to start serious work
on the broad development of optical systems with intensity amplifiers.

To summarize: intensity amplifiers have already been developed and tested on the
basis of a number of pulsed lasers operating on metal vapors. They have turned
out to be quite suitable in the development of instruments designed for specific
practical applications. With their aid it has already been possible to solve a
problem that could not be solved on the basis of traditional optical instrumta.
The development of these amplifiers has also trade it possible to eﬂaark on studies
of the features of optical systems with intensity anplifiers and to develop their
physical bases, and also to develop new instruments for practical applications.

This work, however is still being carried on within a very narrow framework and a
with little effort, which does not accord with the important prospects being opened
up in optics by the use of intensity amplifiers.

[Text] Hicroprocessor sets are the elementary basis for the ccnstmction of con-
puter tnniware and devices of digital radioelectronic apparatus cmracterised by
high reliability. low cost, smll dinensims and low power consumption.

It is intended for engineers engaged in the development and application of nicropro-
cessors.

Preface

Hicroprocessor sets are the elenentary basis for the constructim of computer hard-
ware and devices of digital radioelectronic apparatus characterised by high relia-
bility, low cost. small diaensims and low power consumption.

Thanks to high speed and interference imnity. the possibility of woﬂting in a wide
range or tenperatures and radiation stability, bipolar microprocessor sets based on
microprocessor sections lads on the technological ciraxitry base of transistor-tun-
sistor logic with Schottky diodes have obtained very widespread use by apparatus de-

velopers. The book presented to the reader has also been devoted to this class of
microprocessor sets.

Microprocessor sets assure ﬂexibility of planning. both from the point of view of

apparatus soluticns to satisfy the set productivity of systole and fro- the point or
view of realizing the necessary set of instructions. It is necessary that
developer be well acquainted with all features of the structunl and functiaial or-

ganization of large-scale integrated circuit microprocessor sets. (hly in that case
will he be able to realize the potentials of nicroprocessorr sets.

Hicroprocessor sets contain a bread gaunt of processor. interface and storage large-
scale integrated circuit! for the constzuotion of equipnent for various purposes and

large-scale integrated circuits for organisation of interrupters. control of the
store of microprograns, electrically programmable storage devices with capacities of
1. lb and 161! bits. associative storage units. buffer registers. Iain-line ampliﬁers
and comtators and large-scale integrated circuits for the organization of synchron-
ous and asynchronous echnnge between processors and peripherals.

Transistor-transistor logic with Schottky diodes microprocessor sets consist of
large—scale inteaated circuits of series 1589. “11802 and “1801». In view of the
limited volume ir- the book only those of series K589 and methods of constructing
apparatus on the basis of them rave been examined in detail. It lust be noted e§-'
pecially tint large-scale integrated circuits of different series are interchange-—
able. and this per-its achieving better characteristics in speed. productivity. di-
nensions and power consumption in different apparatus.

The book consists of seven chapters. Chapter 1 presents basic information about the
selection of the conp0sition and structural organization oflarga-soale integrated—
circuit microprocessor sets. Chapters 2 - 5 are devoted to description of series

K589 large-scale integrate.‘~ circuits and questions of their application. By chapters
this material is arranged in the following manner: in chapter 2 is a description of
the functioning of the K 589 set ies large-scale integrated circuit and its circuitry;
in chapter 3 is a calculation of the time of synchronization cycles for several stan-
dard cases of its realisation: in chapter 1} the designing of central processors is
examined. the realization of apparatus and microcrogral pa rte is shown. the develop-
ment of microcprograms by means of a 'mamal" assembler is shown. and examples are
presented of the execution of nicroprograns for addition. subtraction. mltiplication
and division, interruptions are analysed. etc; chapter 5 is devoted to the practical
application of series K589 large-scale integrated-circuit microprocessor sets in ap-
paratus micro-computers with a system of nini-conputer instructions and a controller
for storage on ﬂoppy magnetic disks amen-med. large-scale integrated circuits
of series KR1802 are brieﬂy described in chapter 6. Chapter 7 is devoted to a de-
scription of a system for the automation of nicroprograming intended for developers
of apparatus based on microprocessor sets.

In presenting the material the authors strove to accent attention to questions which.
in spite of their importance. rave still not been discussed adequately in the litera-
ture accessible to the developers of apparatus based on large-scale integrated-cir-
cuit microprocessor sets. or have been discussed insufficiently systenatically. Ac-
quaintance with thsee questions ought to contribute to the proper use of microproces—
sor sets.

The authors are obliged to Doctor of Technical Sciences Professor A. G. Aleksenko
and A. V. Kobylinskiy for sunning the muscript' and making useful comments.

[Text] 1.1. Classification of Hieroprocessor large-scale Integrated Circuits (BIS)

All microprocessor BIS's can be divided into three classes: single-crystal micro-
computers. nicroprooessor sets besed cn single-crystal licroprocessors. micropro-
cessor sets (m's) based on processor sections. or sectionslized Hat's (SHPK's).

mble controllers. conercisl calculators, cesh registers. etc. Single-crystal

micro-counters are rich less expensive than mcro—cOIputed-s nude with micropro-
cessor sets.

A licroprocessor set based on single—crystal micrOprocessors includes: a large-scale
integrated-circuit microporcessor containing a processor with with 9. fixed struc-
ture and instructions list33etlarge-scs1e integrated-circuit non (the mask-type or

output devices (WV); a. large-scale integrated circuit of controllers. generators.

timers, etc. The microprocessor set can include a. ntrix large-scale integrated
circuit for the realization of ordered circuits for control, connmicscions, etc.

The fixed structure of a single-crystal Iult-iprocessor does not permit using
microprocessor sets besed on then for the construction of powerful conputeo: enters
and high-speed data processing equipment. The existing inadequacies of HPK's are
the limited possibilities of exchanging intonation with the external environment.
organisation of parallel processing and inoresse of productivity. The capacity of
programs of systems constructed on the besis of a. single-crystalline HPK can reach
6M bytes, the time of perforunce of instructions fron 2 to 10 microseconds, and
the cast is the average between single-crystalline um-conmters and systems with

sectionslioed 1111's. The ares of application is rim-computers. controllers. date

Sectionalized m's include a minimum number of BIS's, compatible with each other.
of different functional purpose (processor. interface. nova, Iain memories, etc).
by leans of which it is possible to realise structures with different organization
and digit capacity. a multiple of 2, l; and 8. The instructions list is selected

by the system developer in accordance with its specific purpose and is realized by

the nicroprogram nethod by recording in the storage unit nicroprograns based on the
main memory or the electrically programmble RM's.

The breakdown into sections of the processor and interface parts permitted creating
large-sale integrated circuits with different bus organizations combined, separate,
two-directional and also with different structural oranization to increase the in—
formational capacity horizontally and vertically. which permits realizing nodular

structures with highly efficient commnication between then, including also the con-

veyer nethod of processing. The capacity of system programs based on sectionalized
microprocessor sets can anount 'te several hundred kilowatts.

The use of SHPK's is effective in cases where mximum productivity is necessary.
that is. in universal and specialized conputers realizing various instruction lists
in controllers and radio engineering equipment, and also in equipment for real-time

signal processing. digital filtration and spectrum analysis. Those areas of appli-
cation cannot be realized on micro-computers and single crystalline microprocessors.

and so questions of the development and improvement of large-scale integrated-cir-
cuit sectionalized microprocessor sets are an important direction in the development
of microprocessor technology.

[Text] Hith the developnent of microprocessors and licroprocessor sets of large-
scale integrated circuits the cbnstruction of couputer hardware and scans of auto-
mation has changed substantially. This. the application of nicroprocessor sets of
BIS of series K 589 on TTL circuits with Schottky diodes. which hive broad functional
possibilities. makes it possible to effectively solve questions in the creation of
nicro- and mini—computers for wide use. autonsted systems for the control of techno-
logical processes. oonputer peripherals. etc.

The present clnpter examines the use of m BIS of series K 589 for the development
of nicro-conputers with sinustiai of the instructions list of the 14-6000 mini-com-
puter and a controller to control the floppyusgnetic disk store.

5.1. Micro-computer Based on the Series‘XﬁJBls m

The structure of a. processor on a single plate is depicted on Figure 60. The central
processor, executed on a series K589 BIS. consists of a. matrix of central processor
elements (TsPE), s nicroprogral control unit (Bl!) controlling the rotary on a PPZU
and sons additional circuits with a moderate degree of integration. Arranged on the
plate is s synol'u‘mms pulse generator (08!) which ferns pulses for the Ten. mm and
other synchronous devices.

The arithletic-logic device. The TsPE matrix with an accelerated transfer circuit
(50?) realises eritmetis and 1ogies1 operetious. and also the register hem of the
central processor. a: the witionsl integrated circuits of series K155 are gathered

on the plate is arranged the BIS of a priority interruption unit (an). The input
and output deta lines are combined into a. line forner in a single two-directional
data line. The address line also emerges iron the plate through line for-ere. To
select one of the possible peripherals. on the plate are .teonssm circuits. forn-
ing the first decoder of the code of selection of the peripheral. All these addi-
tional circuits are necessary to realise couplets compatibility of prograls for the
11-6000 conputer and the described um-cosputer.

To reduce the time required for execution of the register instructions a single M
circuit is used (organisation 256 x u) on eight address inputs. to which the instruc-
tion positions and signs to be‘snalyzed are attached. and the information outputs
serve for determination of the possible omission of the following nioroinstruotion.

The control equipnent includes a BIS Bill “589301). a nicroprogran memory (m).

a conveyor register (Rgﬁt) and several mltiplexors (he-nu). The conveyor register
is organized on D-triggers with recording of infomtion on the front (K15SIR1 ni—
u-ocircuits). The mitiplexors are necessary for enansion of the functional possi-
bilities of the Bill. and also to reduce the number of successively performed micro-
instructions accomplishing the given instructions.

To perforn conditional transitions on one of the signs not being formed during ere-
cution of the following microinstruction a l6-input liltiplexcr H2 serves. m its
input arrive :sone digits of the microinstruotion (for maple, A0. . A6. etc) sig-
nals from the control panel. etc.

Infomtion from that multiplexer can pass through through the lit-input lultiplexor
H3 to the input of signs and to the A00 control input. Tint is done to increase the
number of possible conditional transfers in the ml). The tar-input mltiplexor is
necessary for passage to the input of the BI!) sips of sigisla arising during exe-
cution of the following nieceinstruotim. The mltiplexor is included in the cir-
cuit because the delay of passage of the signal through the 16-input ultiplexor is
about 50 ns. and this involves a considerable increase of the cycle of execution of
the microinstruction withmt formlation of the H2 lultiplexor.

In all types of instructions of the 116000 nini-conputer there 2- - -r. .:

which determine the execution of several operations. for example digits 1—4 in re-
quest instructions, digits 6-?. 8‘9. 7-9. and 13-15 in register instructions and
digits ?--9 in the input—output instructions group. If it is taken into considera-
tion that the Bill can perform conditional transfers with respect to a group of digits
(for example. the am. m. m and m. transfer functions). it is advisable to teen
one of the-enunuer:artze<r group of digits on the K3 - KO' inputs through 8-input lilti-
plexors. This makes it possible to considerably reduce the tine required for execu-
tion of the instructions. Besides instruction digits onto the inputs K3 - KO of the
Bill through the nultiplexors pass signals fro- the control’. panel which determine

its working conditions during halting of execution of the progral. and data from the
PZU. necessary for analysis of the passages in the group of register instructions.

To save equipnent and the nicroinstruotion nenory. all transfers by grouper digits
are made through a four-digit register of instructions of the Bill. and so before the
conditional transfer is accomplished for the gmup of digits using mm transfer func-
tions such as JPR. JLL, or JRL. it is necessary to' record the values of the (1151“ to

be analysed in the law instructions register by means of instruction JPX.

Calculation of the cycle of execution of a nicroinstruction. The tine dependences
for calculation of the Iicroinstruction cycle are presented on Figure 61. Two syn-
chrowies, obtained tron a single generator, serve for the synclmonization of all
circuits on the processor plate. The nicroinstmotion length is calculated under
the worst dynnic olmcteristics of the nicrocirwits in the temperature range

of 10-70 0 and a voltage of ﬂzﬁ. To calculate the cycle for nicroinstzuction
execution. several very critical paths of passage of infomtion were considered,

the zero and the unit value of the level.

The cycle tile is ta=35+52+22+15+33=l79 ac.

The program control unit has a. linited nunber of possible conditional transfers.
To increase the number and types of conditional transfers a circuit of additional
conditional transfer was developed which mkes it possible to add a transfer sign
to the EMU A00 input. The sign for the additiolnl transfer is selected by the
mltiplexor H2 and through licrodrcuite which lave the delays 5 g2 ns and

= 22 ns respectively and will fall on the input A00. The ti for establish-

It is evident from the presented calculations that the minim cycle tine which
will assure all possible functions of em transfers is 179 ns.

Used for the construction of a synchropulse generator are a 10 MHz quarts genera-
tor and a division circuit which assures a period of synchropulses of 200 ns and
and a synchropulse length of 50 ns.

Fornt of nicroinstructione. In the construction of a central processor on the
basis of series K 589 BIS's the minimum number of digits in a nicroinstruction is
18. of which the seven digits F0 - F6 give the TsPE nicroinstruction. the four

digits FCO - m3 control the logic of em features and the 7 digits A00 - AC6 de-
termine the function for the formation of the following nioroinstructicn address.
Additional nicroinstruotion digits are required for the construction of a. specific

processor. The nicroinstruction formt used in the processor emlating the syste-
of H6000 nini-conmter instructions uses 36 digits.

Digit 1 gives the value of the me): X.

Digits 8 and 9 control the mltiplexor on the TsPE mtrix input.

Digits 11 and 12 control the passage of synchronous pulses into the TsPE. permit-
ting the accomplishment of conditional synchronisation. Digit 11 (1131) permits

the pas of a synchronous pulse to the six larger digits of the TsPE natrix;
digit 12 U32) to the 10 snaller digits. Thanks to this separation of the syn-
chronous pulses the fomtion of the zero and following Rm pages during execution
of address instructions is simpliﬁed. For example. during formation of the follow-
ing page an instruction is carried out for transfer of the contained instruction
nulber register (mm) into the address register (RA), but at am = 1 and ucz = o the
change of the snaller ten digits of the RA is forbidden, and the value of the larg-
est digits _of the m are re—recorded in the RA. At 001 = U62 = 0 it is possible
to verify the content of the registers without crnnging then or in necessary cases
to increase the length of Iicroinstruction execution. Increase of the length of
the cycle of performcs of Iicroinstructions is necessary in the preparation of
the sign of overflbwf. of the operation of addition, which is carried out by
analysis of the transfer into the largest (sign) digit and the transfer from the
largest digit.

Digit 13 allows return to the storage device.

Digit 11+ allows in input-output instructions the passage of intonation and control
signals to the interface plates, strobing the decoder of the address of the input-
output device (WV).

Digits 15 and 16 control the work of the allowance and overﬂow registers. allowing

in necessary oases change of its value in accordance with the result of execution
of the instruction.

Digit 1? detemines the recording or reading of infomtion during reference to
the store. This digit also controls the direction of passage of informtion in
input-output instructions.

Digits 18-21 control the lultiplexor H2, allowing the passage of signals on one
of 16 inputs. and the sane digits in input-output instructions control the work
of peripherals.

Digits 25-28 control the logic of sigasthi-tb‘m.

Digits 29-35 control ' .- the logic of determination of the following micro—
instruction address in the am.

Digit 36 increases the nunber of possible Bill conditional transfers according to

one feature. allowing passage through the circuit of an additional conditional
transfer (sun) on the w nco input.

5.2. Controller for 8. Magnetic Disk Store (mm)

A floppy-did: store is intended for the input. storage and output of infatuation
and can be used as a peripheral storage device for nod-o- and nini-couputers. as-
suring the storage of over 512x bytes of information. In the creation of a control-
ler algorithms for the work of some of the type of "Blektronika MID-70" were taken
as a basis. The nicroprograns of the controller acconplish the following nesory
input-output instructions: recording in the buffer nenory, reading from the buffer

memory, recording of a sector. reading a sector. reading the register of the state
and errors and recording of a sector with Iarking.

Figure 62 shows a controller for magnetic disk stores, nude with series K589 BIS
nicroporcessor sets (EPIC).

The controller includes the following units: a BHU. four TsPE's, five nicroprograns.
a buffer store, a store regimes for-er. a data separation unit. a mltiplexor. input
valves, output valves, an address register. and a hlffer store address register.

The BHJ, TsPE and nicroprogran store constitutemn intonation processing device.
The microinstruction performance cycle selected is 1:00 us. which has permitted
eliminating the accelerated transfer circuit.

A mltiplexor is used to verify the external input signals. The mltiplexor is con-
trolled by a 3-digit selection code which gives on the ACO outlet either the snller
digit of the transfer flmction code or one of the seven exterml signals: the buf—
fer store output (VP). the overflow of the buffer store address register (ESP), the
the generated synchronous signal (VS). the produced data (VD). the passed synchron-
ous signal (PS), the output of transfer from the smaller digit of the TsPE file
(so), the wtput of the larger digit of the buffer store address register (A8). The
signals VS, VD and P8 are produced by the data division unit, read from the floppy
magnetic disk.

The nicroprogram store is mde of four pregamble persenent storage units (PPZU)
organized into a file of 512 words of 32 digits each. The controller microinstruc-
tion is divided into the following controlling fields:

-- a. field of mu transfer functions (7 digits);

-- a field of control of the multiplexor output (3 digits);
-- a. field of control of decoder inputs (3 digits);

-- a field of control of the mltiplexor output (3 digits);
-- a field of control of the logic of signs (lb digits);

-- a field of the melt or data (8 digits).

The BIS AR (Fig 6%) includes the following devices: an infatuation register (1111)..
an intonation shifter (an). an emnsion register mltiplexor (RR), e. left unit
retrieval unit (UPLYe), a result spiioing unit ( (van). a zero sign romtim cir-
cuit ((SF'PA), a sign issuance cirwit (SW), an overﬂow sign fomtion circuit
(SF'PP). a mltiplexor of the para-eter shift (HPS), a register of the parsleter
shift (RPS). an output data buffer (man). an output mm: of the pen-eta: shift
(ms) and e. licroinstruction operation code decoder (nsrm).

The information register and the RPS serve for the storage of infcmtim and the
shift para-star at the nonent the result is issued, that'is. the two-directiaisl
min lines are uncoupled. The (:1) serves for shift of information I). which is de-
termined by the binary code of the shirt parameter. P0 - P3. For inplenentation

of arithnetic shifts to the right the circuit has the possibility of mltiplying
the sign. CD always performs left shifts. Right shifts are obtained thrwgh left

digits BO - 315, and the shift par-aneter P0 - P3 is fed in the supplenentary code.
In that case the larger digit of the shift paranter 31b is equal to unity.

The expansion register nultiplexor passes the sdveneed (falling out) digits to
the an. During shift to the left this is the infomtion no - 315. and during
shift to the right. V0 - V15. RR serves for the storage of digits falling out

during shifts. The presence of RR penits by mcroprograns expanding the digit
capacity of the shifted word.

The left unit retrieval unit serves for determination of the digit number of the
first unit on the left (starting fron the largest digit, 15). The result of the
retrieval is issued in a Higit code to the USR. In addition, the UPLYe will is-
sue to the SVP the sign of absence of l on line 35. The 1183 serves for fornstion
of the result as a fcmtion of the modification of the shift (logical, cyclic.
etc) and represents a multiplexer which assures the operation of logical addition.
The USR ale: issues to the "ﬁle the result of retrieval of the left unit on the
line R0 - R .

The output data buffer issues the result of operation RO-Rl5 to the two-direction-
al main line of infatuation BBQ-17315. The VBPS issues the result of retrieval of
the left unit to the two-directional shift parameter SPGBO - W.

The shift paranoter mltiplexor serves for issuance to the RPS of the shift para-
meter or front the min line SN! or fro- the line sun as a function of the control
signal of selectim of the ems parameter. The SFPN lease a signal 0! equality to
zero of all the digits RO - 1115 which arrive free the USR. The SVP issues the last

nals corresponding to the code of operation F0 - F2 and the largest digit of the
shift parameter Sh.

Let us consider the word: of the AR during shift operations. When 1 is fed to the
CIR informatihn input the informition which arrives fro. the two-directional lines
is recorded in the RD. Simltaneously with that the code of shift from the two-
directiimal lines SFGB when 1 is on the SECS input or free the 81701 lines when 0 is

code. During shift to the right Sh = 1. and the digits P0 - Pe are fed in a supple-
mentary code.

During expanded shift. information B or c is simultaneously issued with the infor-

The informtion exchange (OI) BIS is a h-eddress memory which has four lb—digit re-
gisters for infomtion reception and issuance. The BIS OI is intended for use as
an $0211, with the possibility of organizing on.one of the registers of a reader
with increase of the contents by 1.

Figure 66 presents a structural circuit of the information exchange BIS. The BIS

OI consists of the three lt—digit registers R61 362 and RG3 realized on triggers of
the "latch" type. a u-digit double reader (E605 with the possibility of parallel

H8, H0 and "X the recording of information from channels A. B. C and X in selected
registers is allowed.

In both recording and reading regimes the necessary BIS OI register is selected by
the decoders DOA. DOB. Dec and Bax by assigning a binary code to the address inputs.
The content of the register R60 is increased when a positive voltage-drop on the 01

input. For correct performance of the counting operation. during the feeding of the
positive front of the signal on the CI input it is not permitted to feed even one

of the code address lines determining the register address under the conditim of
the presence of allowance of exchnge and a. signal of recording from tint- line.

It follows from the description of the working regiles that a. direct transfer of
intonation cen be made from one main line to another through any register except
the R60 retister. To do that. the control signals of the Iain line of the source
of information should be so set that it produces a recording of the information
from the main line of the source in one of the registers registers. and the control

signals of the min line of the receiver of infomtion be set in the condition of
reading on the main line-receiver from that regiser in which the recording is ends

The main lines DA. DB,and Dc are intended for work on short lines of conmication.

mtched lines of communications.

If a recording is made in any of the registers of information one of the min lines

and simltaneously with tint code on the address lines of rain lines deterlines

the sane register and recording regime, then in the register is recorded the result
of a step-by-step cascaded 0R opention with the information on those min lines.

6 .6 . Serial Bultiplier

The BIS UMP is intended for the construction of devices for mltiplication and di-
vision of binary codes and devices for the mltiplication of numbers represented .
in a supplementary code. Operations of lultiplication are performed on two 8-digit
operands. The obtained result has 16 digits. The operation of division is carried
out on a 16-digit code of the dividend and an 8-digit code of the divisor with the
result obtained in the fern of an 8-digit quotient and an 8-digit reminder.

To obtain devices with large digit capacity (a mltiple of 8) +several BIS's are used.
The presence of a result determining the largest crystal (0H3) and a result of crys-

tal selection (CS) perlits during increase conducting operationswwithout introducing
additional circuits with the productim Of definite features of the result.

The reception of initial data and the issuance of the result are done over the sane -
two-directional lines and this makes it possible to econonize on the BIS outlets.

The 11!? {Figure 68) includes the following devices: registers (m. 112. 33). nilti-
plexors Ml. H2. H3). 2. sumtor (CH). a control unit (UU). an output buffer to is-
sue the result over the main line (m). an output buffer to issue the result over

the mainline (van) a circuit to issue the digits being analyzed (sun), a circuit
to issue signs (SW5.andan instruction register (RI).

The 8-digit RI register serves to receive the nultiplier in lultiplication opera-
tions and and of the sailor word of the dividend: during division. In the process
of performing those operations the sinner digits of the product and quotient are
formed in the El. The RI register consists of two single-cycle registers 111‘ and?
Bl“. In the single-cycle 8-digit register R2 the multiplicand in operations of ml-
tiplication and the divisor in division are stored. The two-cycle lO-digit register
R3 serves for recording the largest word of the dividend during division. In the
process of mltiplication and division the regular partial product and partial rennin-
der respectively are recorded. After the operation is completed the largest digits

of the product during multiplication are formed during multiplication and the rennin-
der during division.

the input of control of the buffer output cascade. the product is ismed. The pre-

sence of a product register permits naming a conveyor working regime of the miti-
plier, which can be regarded as a stage of a conveyor system.

The control input ﬂ = 1 blocks the D-trigger of the product register, which becomes
potential and the informtion from the register inputs constantly passes to the out-
puts (the register as it were is cut off. 'transparent').

6.9. 16x16 lultiplier

The 16x16 mitiplier represents a high-speed conbinction device for mltiplioation
of 16-d1git operands. Each of the operands can be either a code (a nulber without a
sign) or a number with a sign. In the letter case such an operand is presented in
an additional code. The numbers can be both whole numbers and alsller than 1. (h

The BIS U! can be used for high-speed processors of digital infer-stun processing.
which realize the BF? alforithn, diatal filtration. etc. and also in specialized
and universal digital conputers.

The operation of rounding is acconplished simultaneously with sumation of partial
products by the addition of unity to the largest digit of the discarded part.

During the action on numbers with a sign the possibility is presented of adding the
sign of the product of its slallest part. For that, RS lust equal 0.

By means or the shifter (31)), which is controlled by the siglal as. the product 1’

the product.

The recording is made on the front of the signals OIKI. and cm are blocked, the b-
triggers of the registers become potential and the informtion iron the registerin-
puts gradually passes to the outputs (the registers are transparent).

The output buffer cascades 'are controlled by the signals TPIL (the smallest part of

the product) and TRIH (the largest). The buffer cascades are in an excluded state
in which the control signal equals 1.

To reduce the nunber of used BIS outputs, the digits of the seller part of the pro-
duct are applied on the line of mltiplier Pl} which thus is two-directional.

The 12xlz mltiplier represents a high-speed combination device for mltiplication of

12-digit operands. The structuraIL-circuit and working principle are analogous to the
BIS of the 16x16 multiplier. A distinctive feature is that the BIS does not have
two-directional outputs.

of control of the various MR working regiles.

The principal working regimes of the BIS MAR are:

l) a regiae of suporoperative memory with organization of Tfpur t fair" registers
of four digits each (4 + 15 x h digits);

2) a regime of superoperative senor-y with organization of 'four" registers of eight
digits each (h x 8 digits):

3) a regine of associative senor-y (a field of associative signs);
1‘) a regille of associative nelory (a field of basic memory).

6.11:. Programble logical mtrix

The nicrocircuit represents an electrically programble logical natrix (m1), which
accomplishes eight output functions of 16 input variables.

The areas of PM application are: PZU of large capacity; logical units; code conver-

ters; peripheral controllers; nicroprogras control devices: retrieval tables and con-
trol autanta.

The output functions can have an active level of both 1 and 0.

Logical mnctions are represented in the m in disjunctive non-ml {on (m). for
example:

[Text] The cross system of nioroprogramng for BIS nicroprocessor sets (KROSSHPK)
is oriented toward work with any nicorprocessor sets. The systen is intended for
the debugging of sicroprograls and the obtaining of starting data for PM! program-
ning. The input language is techno-independent and permits describing the control-
ling fields of a nicroinstruction and the functional connections existing between
fields. The systenismlizedinthelangmgemmﬂandcanbesetuponany

The min function of KROSSHPK is the conversion of umprograns written in the
input language ma into a form suitable for programing various P20 and PPZU equip-
ment. Thsi function is realised in two stages: the assembly of a prograq in the
IN“ language and the generation of a file for P211 progra-dng.

7.1. Input language

for the compact recording of developed information. mtput programs assure output
to the alphanumeric printer ATsPU. a perforator and ngnetic tape of all the neces-
sary infomtin. The M program is the Inn: program of the system and aswres
distribution of control between the KROSSHPK program and modules.

The starting data and tests of microprograms can be orgnized on any carrier. In
view of the fact that the translation is accomplished in one pass. ibis-«norm-
sary :that the output file be~rewindable. -2 ‘ .

The forms- tables of ma ocodes can be recorded on Ingnetic tape for the special
mnction man. By the same token the stage of creation of tables is separated
from the stage of translation of microprogxams, which can be used separately. This
is convenient. that is. practice shows that the planner oranges the introduced de-
signatims mach more rarely than the microprograms during their debugging. The
tables of mnemocodes are connected by means of the function m.

7.3. Form and Composition of Output Informtion

During output to a printer the input file is divided into three parts. The first
part contains a description of the microprocessor set, the second--microprogram
texts, and the third a description of the used PZU (m) crystal and the arrange—
ment of the uMion digits by m digits. The output to the printer of
the m description is made in the presence of the control word TEXT? in the opera-
tor PRINT.

The description of the m (PPZU) crystal and. the operators of arrangement are
brought out to the printer in the presence of the control word am in the opera-
tor PRINT.

The file PRIDE contain- the trimmed text of the microprogram. The numbers and ad-
dress of the aicroinstruction in the file ma can be printed in any number system.
The file is brought out on the printer by pages (each page contains 60 lines).

The file TABLE containing memocode tables is brought out on the printer in the pre-
sence of the control word TABLE in the operator Pam. An example of print-out of
the mnemocode table is presented by Figure 75. The table is brought out on the
alphanumeric printer by pages. Each page contains 28 lines. In the table headings
are presented the names of the fields included in the microprogram. In the first
colum is the address of the microinstructicn in any number system except the binary,
and in the second, the mrking. Printed in the table are the mnemocodes used in
determining the fields in the microprogram. If any field has been determined by
direct attachment in a given graph the code of the given field will be presented in
the same number system as the address. If any field has been identified as a field
of transition, in the corresponding graph. besides the deeigiation of function. the
address of transition will be printed. The arguments of functions are not printed
in the table.

If there are more than 15 fields in the microinstruction. a transition to the follow-
ing line ocwrs. Therefore work with the file TABLE is convenient in the case where
the number of fields in the microinstruction is not more than 15.

They all make it possible to more simply organize the calculation process. The
nodes of the graph-scheme for the algorithm can be divided into two types:
--nodes at which addition of two complex numbers occurs:

[Regg'jnqjkfkegpqngm (3)

-and nodes at which two operations of multiplication with subsequent addition are
performed:

This algorithm can be implemented as a hybrid cellular array {6] (fig. 2).

2. PNK - voltage-to-digital 5. 00 - control unit

3. 20 - storage unit generator

The role of each node in the graph-scheme of fig. 1 is performed by a hybrid
computing unit (GVB).

The device operates as follows:
after the control unit (00) receives the control information, it tunes the struc-

ture to the needed dimension of analysis; in the process. there occurs coding in
the voltage-to-digital converter (PNK) and storage by the storage unit (20) of the
data subject to processing, as well as generation of the necessary matrix of

trigonometric factors (WK) by the trigonometric factor generator (CTR). After com-
pletion of the preparatory period in the response time at the output of the device,
the Fourier factor values are set that after coding in the voltsge-to-digital con-
verter can be output upon request to an external device.

The advantages of this computer are:
-minimal calculation time achieved by maximal parallelism of the process of pro-

cessing the input data; and
—-the capability of multidimensional analysis.

digital processors implement by hardware or algorithm one or more “butterflies“
(four nodes of the graph-scheme of the EFT algorithm linked directly to each other).
which in the process of calculation cover the entire algorithm, organizing the
logic in the appropriate way [7]. It is convenient to also use this approach in
designing the hybrid device, since it will allow substantial reduction of the
equipment used.

Let us consider the organization of a hybrid processor with shift registers as
storage units 201, ZUZ. 205 and 206 (diagram of it is shown in fig. 3).

 

Fig. 3.
Key:
1-6. 201 - 206 -- storage unit 1 -6 10. PNK - voltage-to-digitsl converter
7. channel 11. 00 - control unit
8. 60h - hybrid section 12. GTK -- trigonometric factor
9. PNK - voltage-to-digital generator
converters 13. MIX - trigonometric factor matrix

The device operates as follows.

First, the two storage units 201 and 202 are filled with information to be pro-
cessed; the first half goes into 201, the second to 202. Then sequential proces-
sing of the primary information starts. Depending on the number of hardware im-
plemented "butterflies" (CV3 [hybrid computing units]) in the hybrid section (GCh),
the 00 [control unit] fills up storage units 203 and 204, which are linked directly
to the hybrid computing units, while the trigonometric factor generator (CTR) fills
up the trigonometric factor matrix (HTK), also linked to the GVB [hybrid computing
units]. Upon completion of these operations, the voltage-to-digital converters
(PNK) code the results obtained which are then stored by the control unit in units
ZUS and 206. Then this process is repeated until all the information in storage
units ZUl and 202 is processed and there are no values corresponding to first tier
values stored in units 205 and 206. For the computation run in the second tier,
the calculation process is similarly organized, except that 205 and 206 are used

to store the initial information and processing results are stored in 201 and 202.

That is how the values in all tiers are calculated. The control unit takes the

final result from either zu1 and 202 or 205 and 206 depending on the value of the
initial access.

In designing a hybrid processor, a number of problems occur that are associated
with selecting the width of the quantities involved in the calculation process [7],
the number of voltage-to-digital converters for converting intermediate analog sig-
nals to digital form and the number of hybrid computing units (CV8). The solution
to these problems has a considerable effect on calculation accuracy and time.

For the structure in question, analysis of the relation between EFT algorithm com-
putation time and the number of "butterflies" (GVB) implemented and the number of
PNK ivoltage-to-digital converters-VDC] used in processing information was per-
formed (fig. 6). The analysis was made for the case when the initial array con-
tained 512 numbers, and the pulse generator frequency was 1 H32.

2. number of butterflies

5. 8 VDC's (l6 VDC's)
6. 8 VDC's
7. 16 VDC's
8. 32 VDC's

 

Pig. 6.

The most interesting case is the structure of a computer containing four “butter-
flies" implemented by hardware. In this case, the capability of making computa-
tions in parallel allows having the number of voltage-to-digital converters without
changing information processing time, i.e. processing the analog signals at the
output of the hybrid section (GCh) not within one step, but two. Parallel computa-
tion occurs because while the VDC's are processing the computation results from

one half of the hybrid computing units, the initial registers are being filled and
computation is performed in the other. The hybrid processor structure using four
VDC's and implementing four "butterflies" by hardware was deemed acceptable. If

computation time must be reduced, hardware must be increased in accordance with
fig. 4.

[Text] The problem of achieving maximu- speed in executing various operations is

a major problem for developers of hybrid coaputing complexes. Array computing de-
vices (HVU) allow with a specified elasent base achieving maximum speed in execut-
ing various arirhnetic operations. It is advantageous to expand the class of prob-
lems implementable by using array computing devices. To this end, let us consider
the problens of designing array computing devices to convert numbers from one
number system to another.

The algorithms for conversion of numbers [1] that can be expressed by using itera~
tion formulas are vell known:

1. Conversion of an integer decimal nu-her A into binary. The masher A in the
binary number system will be represented in the form of A - amsa._1...ao, which
means:
. m . m-l l

A all 2 + and 2 + ... +a102 + a0,

where ao<2 is the remainder from dividing the number A by 2. To obtain the other

remainders, which are digits of the number A in the binary number system, the
iteration fornula has the form:

A1 _ Ai-l-ai-l, remainder a1, Ao-A (l)
2 1-1, 2. ass, n.1,
where A14 is the integer part of the quotient obtained in the (1-1) step.

2. Conversion of a fractional decimal number 3 into binary. The nunber B, repre-
sented in the binary number system as B . blbz...h., can be notated:

I s -1 o -2 o -(n-1) o .1.
B b.12 +b22 l2 +bm2‘

From which the iteration formula for conversion equals:

1-1'31' 113:1?) 2' .... I ’ (2’

+0 0 0+
b‘m-

i

72

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
where bi is the i-th digit of the binary number equal to the integer part of the
decimal number, and Bi-l is the fractional part of the decimal number in the (1-1)
step.

3. Conversion of an integer binary number A to decimal. The binary umber
A . an...alao can be represented as A I (...((a.'2+a'_1)-2+...+az)2+s1)°2+ao.
The iteration formula for finding the decimal number is defined as

A - A '2+a 1-1, 2, 3 v..I-1

m-i m-i+l m-l Ah=en (3)

The result of the operation is the decimal number A - A1.

4. Conversion of a fractional binary number into decimal. The binary number
B-b b ...bIn can be notated in the form of:

1 2
a - ((...(b- *2+bm_1) e 2+...+b2) 92+b1) * 2.

The iteration formula for finding the decimal number has the form:
1 I l, 2, ..., m—l

B
3m bm

mul-B

m-i+1 * 2+bm-i

(4)

The result of the operation is the decimal number B-Bléz.

It can be seen from an analysis of the formulas (1-6) that the conversion opera-
tions can easily be implemented by using two types of array computing devices
since the operations for converting an integer decimal number to binary and a
fractional number to decimal are identical in methods of implementation. Also
similar are the operations for converting a fractional decimal number to binary
and an integer binary number to decimal.

Fig. 1. shows an array computing device for converting an integer decimal number
to binary and a fractional dinary number to decimal. The device consists of rows
of basic cells, each containing a one-digit adder andgate.uhile each tetrad of
basic cells contains a control bus.

The device operates the following way. In converting an integer decimal number to
binary, the binary-coded number A enters inputs Al-A8 of the one-digit adders of

the basic cells of the corresponding tetrada. The tuo's complement binary code of
the number 3 enters the second inputs of the adders in all tetrada. A shift of
the tetrada one bit to the right, which corresponds to the operation of dividing
the contents of the tetrads by 2. is performed by the corresponding internal

array connections. In the shift. if a one is moved into a given tetrad, then
performed in it is the operation of adding the number at the tetrad input to the
two's complement code of the number 3, which corresponds to correction of the
division operation [1]. But if a zero is moved in. by using the gates, the number
entering the tetrad input is sent to the tetrad output.

The operation result, an integer binary number. is generated at outputs a.-ao.

In converting a fractional binary number to decilal. it enters inputs bo-bn.

The operations performed in the device are similar to the foregoing. The operation

results, tetrada of the binary-coded fractional decimal number, are generated at
outputs 31—38 of the device.

Fig. 2 shows an array computing device for converting a fractional decimal nu-ber

to binary and an integer binary number to decinal. In its structure, the device

is similar to the preceding one, but in this case, the basic cell is an adder-
aubtracter.

In converting a fractional decimal number, the binary-coded form of the number
enters inputs 31-38 of the corresponding tetrsda, and the binary code of the umber

3 enters the other inputs. In all tetrsds in the first row. the source number is
converted into code with a surplus 3 to simplify correction of the multiply opera-
tion i1]. A shift of all tetrads one position to the left. Ihich is equivalent to
the operation of multiplying the contents of the tetreds by 2, is performed by the
corresponding internal srray connections. The correcting step in the shift to the
left consists of subtracting the nunber 3 in those tetrads fre- uhich a one was
shifted to the adjacent decimal position. The operation result is generated at
outputs bo-bn.

ln converting an integer binary number to decimal, the number enters inputs e.-eo
of the deivce. The operation is performed by the method described above.

Tetrads of the binaryecoded decimal number are generated at outputs Al-As of the
device.

Results of analysis on the speed of these devices and the known array devices for
number conversion have shown that these array computing devices permit about a
threefold increase in the speed of the number conversion operation; compared to
similar devices with shift registers, there is s 15-fold increase.

The regularity and uniformity of the stray computing device structure make them
most promising for implementation in the form of large-scale integrated circuits.

{Text} The modern applications of speech signal (RS) recognition include:
i) recognition of isolated words in a restricted vocabulary

2) verification of speakers

3) identification of a person

4) diagnostics of defects in conversational speech

5) diagnostics and classification of singing voices

6) diagnostics of the psychophysiological state of a person

7) recognition of sounds of the past.

There are now two alternative approaches to designing recognition systems.

The first approach is based on applying general-purpose computers to organizing
digital methods of speech signal processing [1, 2].

The second method is based on constructing specialized devices for preprocessor
rigid (nonadaptive) processing of speech signals to reduce their volume and extract
informative features and the speech signals are subsequently classified on the

same general-purpose computers [3, A].

The second approach is of particular interest from the viewpoint of the problem of
designing autonomous units for recognition of isolated words from a fixed (tune-
able) vocabulary, as well as speech-input computer terminals (real-time input of
speech). However, two substantial shortcomings inherent to this approach must be
pointed out. First, there is a rigid relationship between the structure of the
unit for preprocessor processing (RR unit) as well as the composition of its func-
tional assemblies and the qualitative-quantitative composition of the feature
space selected subjectively and arbitrarily by the developers. Second, there is
the orientation to performing classification by using one processor, for example,
one minicomputer. In the process, on one hand, there is a great variety of par-
ticularly specialized designs for preprocessors made in the overwhelming majority
on the basis of specially developed functional assemblies. And on the other hand,
there is an obvious disparity between the linear sequence of the computational pro-
cess and the capability (necessity) of organizing the spatially separated process

of computations (parallel computational processes). In the process, both these
substantial shortcomings are interdependent.

Shown in the drawing is the structure of an RR RS [speech signal preprocessor]
which to a considerable extent eliminates the first of the aforementioned short-
comings, and also facilitates to a certain degree eliminating the second one.

Purpose and 33316 Technical Characteristics of the Functional Devices in the
RR [Preprocessor] Unit (see figure).

1. The speech signal input unit (UVRS) is specialized and makes it possible to
effect:

1.1) actual isolation of the speech signal start moment (pulse)

1.2) fictitious isolation of the speech signal end moment (pulse)

1.3) definition of the acoustic pause interval 1P in the speech signal, and in the

8 - 0.8 x 256 - 205 ms

1.4) count of density of "nulls" of complete speech signal in a constant interval of
cyclic time of analysis Tn - 800 microseconds by using an Sm 8-bit adder-accumula-

process, 128x . 0.8 x 2

tor

1.5) amplitude selection of external sound noise from the equivalent level of
voltage at input to the speech signal input unit, 5 mV (~65 dB) to 0.77 V (0 dB) at
10 thresholds

1.6) synchronization of operation of all other functional devices in the RR
[preprocessor] unit, except the UVO [envelope separator] and MD [sealer].

2. The low-frequency band spectrum analyzer (SPANCh) is the ESP-80 series produced
parallel-type spectrum analyzer and makes it possible to effect:

2.1) instantaneous harmonic analysis of the complete speech signal (PRS) in the
hand from 1.5 Hz to 22.4 kHz by using 38 third-octave filters with a filter scanning
frequency (frame frequency) of 33 Hz and adjacent filter switching time (clock time)
of 800 microseconds; in the process, the informative band of actual frequency
analysis of the PRS [complete speech signal] selected was 100 Hz - 10 kHz and is
covtred by using 21 filters

2.2} synchronization of the start of the PNK [voltage-to-digital converter] every
800 microseconds.

3. The envelope separating device (UVO) is specialized and consists of a tuneable
frequency filter (FPCh), amplifier (US), detector (D) and low-pass filter (FNCh).

In the process, the FPCh is an active band-pass filter. the upper *u and lower }1
cut-off frequencies of which can be independently tuned: the }1 from 0 to 6300 Hz,
and the }u from 700 Hz to a . The US [amplifier] provides the needed amount of the

detected signal for approximation of the characteristic D in the appropriate form,
i.c. with signals in the interval 0.2—1 V, a parabolic approximation (square-law
detector), and with signals exceeding 1 V, a linear approximation (linear detector).
The detector (D) is made with a half-wave circuit, most suited for the purposes of
isolating the frequency of the fundamental tone F0 by the peak method of analysis of

the envelope [5]. The ENCh is an active low-pass filter with three discrete cut-off

78

19R OFTHCIAI.IJSEZ(NQLY
values: 15, 30 and 60 Hz. The envelope input unit (UVO) permits effecting isola-
tion of the envelope of the PRS [complete speech signal] with the time constant
10-17 ms (lowhpass filter cutoff frequency is 60 Hz).

4. The sealer (HUS) provides for matching of the output dynamic bands of the
analog signals of the envelope and spectrum readings with the input dynamic hand
of the PNK {voltage-to-digital converter].

5. The voltage-to-digital converter (PNK) is an F733 series produced converter
with a coding cycle of 100 microseconds and 12 information bits in the output code
(1 sign bit).

The converter enahles coding of the instantaneous amplitudes of the spectrum
readings and envelope, as well as the PRS {complete speech signal] from the output
of the US {amplifier}. In the process, only the eight high-order hits are used.

6. The universal interface (USU) is designed to connect the output of the quasi-
analog unit for preprocessor processing of the RS {speech signal] with any TsVH
{digital computer] that has the FS-lSOO type photoinput module (the universal
interface fully matches the Ps-lSOO interface).

The main mode of operation of the RR {preprocessorl unit provides for organization

of three parallel channels of different-type information on the complete speech

signal, namely:

a) channel for input of density of "nulls" in the complete speech signal (channel I)

b) channel for input of amplitude-frequency cutoffs of complete speech signal
(channel II)

c) channel for input of envelope of complete speech signal (channel 111).

In the process. the input PRS {complete speech signal] with dynamic range up to
00 dB from the line output of the magnetic tape recorder goes simultaneously into
the inputs 61 of the UVRS {speech signal input unit]. the SPA-NCh [low—frequency
band spectrum analyzer] and the UVO {envelope separator]. The threshold device in
the speech signal input unit fixes the moment of the ueginning of a word by
generating the appropriate pulse by which the electronic switch is actuated for
polling the tomb of band-pass filters in the spectrum analyzer.

Delay in the start of operation of the switch in relation to the moment the
actuating pulse originates is no more than 3.2 ms. At each successive moment of
switching of the corresponding band-pass resonant filter, the amplitude of the
spectrum reading of the latter goes from the spectrum analyzer output to input 62
of the speech signal input unit, and a control pulse is generated by the analyzer
and goes to the speech signal input unit. Performed upon this pulse is the output
of the code of the density of "nulls" in the complete speech signal, formed within
the 800 microsecond time, from the counter in the speech signal input unit to the
receiving register Png in the USU [universal interface] along with the notifica-
tion signal "Code Output." By this same control pulse from the spectrum analyzer,
the voltage-to-digital converter is actuated and . the digital code of the
amplitude of the spectrum reading is generated, which goes from the spectrum
analyzer in transit through the appropriate gate to the speech signal input unit
to the scalar and voltage-to-digital converter. Then the converter is reactuated
to code the amplitude of the complete speech signal envelope, which goes from the

79

envelope separator output in transit through the appropriate gate to the speech
signal input unit to the sealer and converter. The codes of the amplitudes of the
spectrum readings and envelope go to the receiving register Png in the universal
interface alternately in time along with the corresponding notification signals
"Code Output" generated by the converter.

Thus, every 800 microseconds, from the receiving register in the interface unit,
there go to the computer (digital unit for isolating secondary features and per-
forming classification) in parallel form sequentially one after the other

three byte words, namely the code of channels I, II and III respectively along with
the corresponding "Code Output" notification signals. "hen the speech signal ends
(fictitious, ice. with the

Izax=205 ms delay), the speech signal input unit generates a pulse used to termi-

nate operation of the spectrum analyzer and the entire preprocessor as a whole.
The same effect is achieved when the signal "Input Interruption" is received from
the digital computer through the universal interface by the speech signal input
unit.

In addition to the basic mode discussed, the preprocessor provides two auxiliary
modes.

In auxiliary mode I, the complete speech signal is input from the amplifier output
directly through the scaler, converter and interface to the computer. In the pro-
cess, the initial actuation of the converter and interruption of its operation is
effected by the detector of the start and end of the speech signal in the speech
signal input unit (by the "Input Interruption" signal from the digital computer)
respectively.

In this mode, the converter is actuated by a crystal oscillator with a frequency
of 10 kHz.

In this case, the source complete speech signal has to be passed through a low-pass
filter with a S-kHz cutoff frequency respectively. Such a filter is organized by
tuning the tuneahle frequency filter.

Auxiliary mode II is the mode of operating the spectrum analyzer autonomOusly,
achieved by disconnecting the other functional devices in the preprocessor.

In conclusion, it is necessary to note that the principle of the preprocessor with
organization of three flows of information on the complete speech signal, imple-
mented in this work on the base of series produced devices of VG [expansion
unknown], both analog and digital, with a minimum number of specialized devices in
the preprocessor structure, can be considered a prototype in designing autonomous
devices for recognition of isolated words in a fixed vocabulary as well as for
some of the other tasks listed in the first paragraph of this article.

[Article by S. H. Krylov]

[Text] Much attention has been paid recently to problems of developing various
systems for acquisition and processing of analog information based on micropro-
cessors [2, 3. 5]. This is due not only to the high degree of integration and
potential low price of microprocessor large-scale integrated circuits, but also to
the capabilities offered the apparatus developer, namely: execution of various
functions on the sane equipment (universality) and programmed variation of these
functions. At the same time, series digital microprocessors are ill suited to
direct interaction with the analog portion of the data acquisition system because
of the natural orientation of their instructions to processing digital information.
Using such a microprocessor to control analog equipment entails developing special
interfaces {1] and, as a rule, is rather inefficient. Therefore, the majority of
analog-digital data processing systems are mediocre in interaction between the
analog and digital portions, the analog-to-digitel {ADC} and digital-to-analog [DAG]
converters {3].

The system discussed in this article is one in which the functions of control of
elementary analog operations and individual stages of AID and D/A conversions have
been transferred to a special control unit with a very simple structure, a nano-
processor. One possible schematic implementation, made with standard K155 and
K131 series TTL-SIS [transistor-transistor-logic medium scale integrated circuits],
is shown in fig. 1. '

The nanoprocessor contains a clock pulse generator (04.1, D1.3), controlled by a
start-stop flip-flop (02.2), s five-bit programmed counter (D2.1, Do), a decoder of
one-address operations (D7), a a decoder of addressless operations (08) and a

strobe shaper for the instruction counter (05, 03.2, D3.3). There are three fora
mats of instructions executed by the nanoprocessor: branch format (format attri-
bute is a "1" in the zero bit of the instruction word), one-address instruction for-
mat (attribute is a "0" in the zero bit) and the addressless instruction format
(attribute is the code "0111" in bits zero through three inclusive).

A feature of the scheme is the use of a multiplexer (D5) to analyze the conditions
(attributes) of branches in branch instructions and generate tLe appropriate strobe

for the program counter (receiving the branch address or incrementing the counter
readings by one). The branch operation code enters address inputs Al-A3 of multi-
plexer DS, in accordance with which one of the information inputs 4-7 is connected
to its output. If the signal at this input equals a logical one, there will be
generated at 03.2 a strobe for receiving the address of the branch (bits 3-7 in the
instruction word) to the instruction counter 02.1-06. Otherwise, there will be
generated at 3.3 the strobe "add one to instruction counter," and "receiving the
branch address" is selected in the adjustment by the regulator of the capacitance
of C1.

The nanoprocessor instruction word length adopted is 8 bits, which with the 5-bit
program counter permits using as program storage the standard K155 series of micro-
circuits with an organization of 32 eight-bit words: the KlSSRYel, KlSSRYe3 or
four KlSSRUZ circuits. Synchronization of their operation with the nanoprocessor
cycle is effected by the signal "iEF' (access authorization). The nanoprocessor

can operate directly with the outputs for readout of these microcircuits.

If required, the instruction word length can easily be extended, for example, to
12 bits, and the capacity of the program counter to 8 (for which a second KlSSIYe7
four-bit counter is included instead of the the flip-flop D2.l). The free outputs
from the operation decoders provide the capability of generating instruction for-
mats in accordance with the structure of an analog-digital system and

requirements imposed on it.

Based on a similar processor, a multipurpose prototype system was developed for
data acquisition, processing and conversion [6]. A simplified structural diagram
of the system is shown in fig. 2.

Besides the control nanoprocessor, -’“

the system contains storage for

32 eight-bit words, a four-bit

TsAP (digital-to-analog converter),

data acquisition and conversion [4]: analog multiplexers and demultiplexers,
scaling operational amplifiers and analog storage elements.

The instruction system consists of 22 instructions in the three aforementioned for-
mats, and the addressless format is used for individual switchings of the analog
circuits in the system, control of the DAc register modes and the reading register
(shift of the reading register by one bit or incrementing the register by one);

the one-address format is used for loading the DAC register. the timer registers
and the register for setting the transfer factor for the scaling operational ampli-
fier. The number written to the appropriate register is placed as an immediate
operand in the address field of the oneesddreas format.

Branching instructions execute the unconditional branch operation as well as condi-
tional branches on several features: end of timer operation, overflow of reading
register and on the analog signal sign.

To demonstrate the capabilities of the system, a number of programs were written to
process and convert data that implement the following functions:

1. "Time Counter." This program reads out time intervals from tens of micro-
seconds to several hours and provides the capability of tying data processing to
the real-time scale.

2. "Analog-to-Digital Conversion." This program generates 12-bit conversion code,
using one 4-bit DAC, and both the depth of conversion and type (into binary or
binary-decimal code) are varied by program facilities.

3. "Heteropolsr Pulse Generator." This program generates at the analog output of
the system heteropolar pulses, the amplitude of which is programmed, and the posi-
tive and negative pulses can have a different amplitude. .

4. "2.5-fold Frequency Increase." This program increases the frequency of repeti-
tion of square pulses coming into the system analog input 2.5-fold and outputs them
at the analog output with the same amplitude.

5. "Complex Shape Pulse Generator." This program allows synthesizing a signal of
essentially any shape by the method of output of a series of voltage levels.

6. "Automatic Frequency Meter." This program meters pulse repetition frequency
with automatic selection of the best of four possible ranges.

7. "Direct Current Filter-Detector." This program converts an input signal into
direct or pulsating voltage of one polarity; a constant signal passes through the
system unchanged, but the higher the frequency of a signal of alternating polarity,
the greater the reduction in effective value until the input signal is fully
attenuated at the cutoff frequency.

8. "Metering of intervals between pulses of negative polarity, negative and posi-
tive polarity, as well as between pulses, the amplitude of which exceeds some

threshold."
9. "Oscillating Frequency Generator." This program generates at the analog output

signals of varying duty factor and duration. The nature of the variation is
specified by program.

The length cf any of the programs listed above does not exceed 32 instructions.
Thus. using the simple control unit (the nanoprocesaor) in an analog-digital system

, for data acquisition, processing and conversion permits making fuller use of analog
equipment and therefore increasing the flexibility (universality) of the system.

Engineering, Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences, Kiev]

[Text] According to the program for development of nuclear power engineering
in the USSR during the past five years, it was planned to put nuclear power
plants with a total of 23,000-25,000 MW into operation. The need for safe,
reliable and economic operation of nuclear reactors arises with the intensive

development of this sector of the national economy.

It is known that the nuber of accidents at nuclear power plants through the
fault of operating personnel canprises from 40 to 80 percent [1]: therefore,
highly qualified servicing of the energy units is of primary importance. The
problem of operator training is being solved successfully by organisation of
=training centers to train operating personnel of ABS equipped with simulators:
i.e., with hardware for occupational training of the human operator and de-
signed to form and improve occupational skills and knowledge required to con-

trol a man-machine system.
The following types of problems should be solved in simulators:

static problans without dynamic feedback (recognition of specific situ-
situations) 3

dynamic problems without feedback (evaluation of the correctness and
completeness of the response of interlocking and shielding):

dynamic problems with feedback (processing control algoritlns under dif-

ferent conditions. estimating the effect of control actions on the dynamics
of a process and so on).

of a nuclear power plant, a training supervisor's console designed to control
the simulator and also to monitor and supervise the training process, a sim-
ulator unit, a computer complex and an integration device.

The basis of the simulator is a cwputer complex that includes various com-
puter devices (according to the type of information to be processed). The
most important function of the computer complex is to reproduce in real time
the operating dynamics of individual units of a nuclear power plant (which is
described by systems of differential and algebraic equations) and mathemati-
cal and logic functions that reflect the response of the subsystems of the
energy units to disturbing effects in any operating modes.

Analog type computers were used in the history of simulator design for power
engineering to achieve high operational characteristics in the quality of
real-time simulation. Simulators were designed primarily on the basis of
computers of a given class as digital computers were developed and improved.
However, achieving real time on a digital computer, as before, is a difficult
task since it is related to investigations of the required composition of dif-
ferential equations and selection of the method of solving them. Therefore,
it is more feasible to use hybrid type computers complexes consisting of dig-
ital and analog computers.

When using hybrid computer systems, one must first distribute the task between
the analog and digital computers so as to best utilize the advantages of com-
puters of both types.

An analog computer is usually deployed as the main computer, while a digital
computer is employed as a control computer which changes the structure of the
dynamic model and simulates the operating logic of the facility control
system (2, 3].

Redistribution of the calculating functions between digital and analog compu-
ters is determined by the specific designation of the simulator. If there is
no need for frequent changing of the dynamics of continuous processes, models
of the main units are reproduced on an analog computer, while logic functions
and storage functions are reproduced on a digital computer. If there is need
for frequent changing of the type of installation. the simulation functions
can be entrusted to a digital computer while fixed processes can be simulated
on an analog computer.

Let us consider the specific characteristics which analog and digital computers
should meet for successful use of them in the computer complex of a simulator.
These characteristics are as follows for an analog computer: reliability of
the structurally realized model, capability of prolonged integration, permis-
sibility of changing the structure of the model and developed parallel logic.
Provision of real time by operating systems, the presence of a developed in-
terface and large storage capacity should be inherent to digital computers.

simulators both abroad and in our country, specifically a simulator to train
operating personnel at the Novovoronezhskaya ABS, are developed by the block
diagram of the simulator presented in the figure. It should be noted that the
initial conditions, nodes and other operations are assigned in these simulat-
ors by flipping the corresponding toggle switches on the control console and
the training supervisor's console. The modes which the training supervisor
uses are determined beforehand and the set of control actions is fixed by a
set of keys on the console.

During functioning of the simulator it becomes necessary to improve the sim-
ulation process, which is related to consideration of new models and modes of
using them, modification of available models and introduction of new «urgency
modes. In this case a fixed configuration of the console and give set of ac-
tions on the model are ineffective.

One of the methods of achieving flexibility of interaction of the training
supervisor with the complex simulator that provides modification and improve-
ment of the control structure if. a high-level problem-oriented language which
the training supervisor can use to easily canpile control programs and to pro-
vide a dialogue mode of interacting with the system.

Subsystems whose models should be reproduced on the simulator are used to
solve systems of a large volume of equations that include algebraic, logic and
differential equations. Real-time solution of these equations on a digital
computer is difficult, while the use of analog devices leads to the need for
structural realization of developed logic control devices of analog operating
units. Highly efficient specialised devices, which reduce the calculating
time with insignificant additional expenditures to develop them, can be
developed to solve this problem.

ital computer of the MIR series). a set of problem-oriented processors (ser-
ially produced analog computers and a processor for solving systems of alge-
braic equations) and a device for communicating with the system. The system
is oriented toward solution of real-time simulation problems with inclusion
of real equipment, parametric optimisation of dynamic facilities and identi-
fication and boundary-value problems and is designed to conduct experiments
at scientific research organizations, in laboratories and at vuzes.

[Text] The current state and prospects for development 0! high-speed compu-
ters and the feasibility of using hybrid computers in which machine variables
are represented by proportional time intervals are analyzed in [l] . Parallel
processing of these intervals permits one to achieve high total speed of cal-
culating structures with simultaneous representation of variables. However,
the time intervals proportional to independent variables are formed on digital
counting structures by interrogation of the corresponding counters by tining
frequency generator pulses. This leads to the need to develop coupler multi-
counter structures. which is related to an increase of the equipment required
and to the complexity or the system.

Parallelling of. the calculating process is most easily accomplished during
calculations using scalator computer devices that perform the binary operation
of scalar multiplication of N-dinensional vectors:

The design principles of timer type hybrid scalators, in which the (“riables

timer devices by analogy with timers in which RC circuits are used as the

The principle of time-pulse conversion of the constant time of an RC circuit
to digital code. where the RC circuit is used as an analog multiplier circuit
mose time constant is proportional to the product of parameters R and C, is
described in aﬁybrid multiplier device in [5, 6].

The controlled RC circuit with tine-code converter is an elementary binary
converter that operates the scalator sequentially in time, which will have
digital input and output upon realization of R and C in the form of digital
control resistor and capacitor. Connection of these parallel-operating ele-
mentary multiplier devices to calculate operation (1) into a eneous cal-
culating structure permits one to find the sum of pair products at 1,812) dur-
ing execution of a single i-th multiplication operation. A block diagram of
this N-dimensional binary scalator is presented in Figure l, a.

The problqa of creating a simple hybrid timer scalator to calculate K—nary
operations of the scalar product of vectors is postulated in this article.
At the same time the division operation in timer scalators that use time-
giving FCC-circuits is carried out. A block diagram of an N-dimensional
K-nary scalator is sham in figure 1. b.

Functionally, a K-nary scalator is a hybrid canputing structure with halo-
geneous analog calculating medium of timer type. The element of this median
is shown in Figure 2, a. Two control Etc-circuits (R1C1 and chz) with dis-
charge keys are exponential voltage generators (GEN) and the analog storage
device (A20) is strobed and is used to shape the reference voltage on a com-
parator. The input and output variables of the component are time intervals,
which permits direct connection of components. forming a calculating medium
homogeneous in structure. A fragment of this medium is shown in Figure 2. b.
The first exponential voltage generator of the first component and the timer
that counts interval to are started upon a signal of the timing oscillator
(61‘). A signal from the timer output starts the second exponential voltage
generator and the analog storage device of the first component. The instan-
taneous fixed value of exponential voltage is fed from the output of the first
exponential voltage generator to the comparator input and is compared to the
current exponential voltage of the output of the second generator. The con-
dition is fulfilled at the moment the voltages are equal

The component shown in Figure 2, a can be used as a timer that controls inter-
val to provided that the analog storage device is replaced by a direct refer-
ence voltage source. In the general case the described caponent or a homo-
geneous medium is a functional timer that performs multiplication-division
operations, which permits one to characterize scalator computing devices of
the proposed type as timer devices.

A schematic diagram of the canponent is shown in Figure 3, in which an HOP
[metal oxide seIIicOnductorJ--keys of 1‘3 series—and operating mplitier

the keys and the input impedance of the comparator nade it possible to realise
an analog storage device using a single capacitor C; that simulatneously per-
forms the calculating function and one disconnect key (half of microcitcuit

It is easy to see that connection of the couponents (Figure 2. a) by the di-
agram shown in Figure 2, 1: permits one to construct a homogeneous calculating

medium both in two-dimensional (plane) and three-dimensional (volunstric)
version.

The inputs and outputs of the elanentary calculating units 1, II,..., N can
be mutated one after the other in a similar homogeneous calculating median
according to the given configuration required to make calculations by specific
formula functions.

As already noted, the operating parameter (machine variable) of the given
homogeneous calculating medium is time t. This permits rather simple connec-
tion of a similar homogeneous analog calculating median to digital computing
devices without using complex analog-digital converters and also permits one
to create a hybrid processor. the role of the analog part of which is per-
formed by the described hmogeneous calculating medium, while the role of the
digital part is performed by known digital processor components. The capa-
bility of realizing the component of this meditm in the microelectronic con-
version permits one to hope that a similar homogeneous medium may be an analog
microprocessor with the corresponding circuit engineering and technological
development. Fundamental connection of digital and the described analog micro-
processors permits one to create qualitatively new microcomputers of hybrid
type that carbine the advantages of both digital and analog computer equipment.

One should especially note the capability of organizing the calculating process
in any part of the processor on a specific group of components of a homogeneous
calculating medium, which permits one to solve a masher of independent problems
simultaneously and mutually independently. If sane components fail, the func-
tions and calculating capabilities of the processor designed on its basis are
essentially retained since the remaining components are operable, which deter-
mines the high viability of computer equipment of this type.

Taking the extensive use and simplicity of transmission of impulse duration
modulated signals or the time intervals in the omnications devices into ac-
count, one can connect spatially distributed hasogeneous scalator timer proc-
essors into a unified computer network, which permits a practically unlimited
increase of the calculating capacities of this network.

[Excerpt] Introduction. 'ihe program module pack for configuration of multi-
problem real-time dialogue system (NSRV) is a caplex of adjustable and
permanent program modules, from which different versions of multiproblu real-
time dialogue systems adjusted for a specific UV! [control cmputer complex}
are developed by generation and configuration.

The 1:14an is designed to execute in real time in the interpretation modes
programs compiled in the dialogue mode in BASIC-RV language.

BASIC-RV language is an expanded version of BASIC language [1]. The main ex-
pansions are as follovs: the external subroutine cell operator, the time end
external events problem control operators, information input-output operations
from facility communication devices, bit processing operations. expanded in-
formation input-output operators from devices and operators for working with
files.

The typical problems solved by DHSRV is infatuation gathering and processing
in production process and scientific experiment control systems and also con-
trol of production or scientific (laboratory) equipsent.

The following minimum configuration of equipment is required for operation of
the DﬂSRV: Ill-7000, SM-lP and SM-ZP .rocessor. internal storage with capacity
of 16 It words. a timer and device for keyboerd entry and display of alphanumer-
ic information.

Program structure. The program designed for execution in the DHSRV consists
of one or several subroutines (problems).

The problan is a sequence of BASIC operators that carry out sane final action.

for example, interrogration and processing of a specific number of analog sig-
nals. Priorities, according to which fulfillment of the problems is controlled.

are assigned to then. The probluns can be related to specific external
events (for example, interruptions due to initiative signal sources) . upon
entry of which they are started for fulfillment or can be started for ful-
fillnent at the onset of specific moments of tine. BASIC-RV language offers
the user the capability of controlling the problems by means of the corre-
sponding operators.

The conditions for starting the task and their priorities are established dur-
ing fulfillnent and can be varied dynamically. An example of a problem that
carries out information entry frat sensors and registration of intonation is

[Text] This is a collection of articles on the technology of
solving problems at collective-use computer centers, based on
software packages (PPP). Described are software packages for
this technology oriented to mathematical methods applied in
various stages of research and those oriented to specific sub-
ject areas. Described are the purpose of specific packages,
methods used in them and some software implementation.

This book is of interest to application software developers.
From the Editors

This collection describes the complex of software packages developed at the Irkutsk
Scientific Center of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Siberian Branch, and certain
organizations cooperating with it. It also deals with the technology of solving
scientific problems at collective-use computer centers (VTs KP). Discussed is the
technology based on a system of packages oriented to mathematical and cybernetic
methods used in all basic stages of research, beginning with computer data input,
construction of a math-atical aodel of the research object, formalization of the
problem statement, study of the existence of and deriving the numerical solution to
the problem, analysis of the properties of the derived solution, such as stability,
invariance and others, and ending with making the decision on the direction of fur-
ther research. These stages and their order are dictated by the methodology of
systems research. This technology affords a high degree of problem research
automation.

Presented in the articles in the first section of this collection is the approach
to planning the computing process in packages and construction of a system that
implements the technology of simulation and optimization of finite-dimensional
systems.

106

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
Described in the second section are the main base packages in this technology,
oriented to methods, and considerable attention in them is paid to these methods.
The section begins with an article dealing with speech signal processing methods
for computer input and recognition. A major stage in research is the construction
of the mathematical model for the system to be studied. Presented in the subse-
quent articles are the approach to automating design of mathematical models, the
information system for selection of the description of the mathematical model by
features and a system of programs for deriving differential equations of the motion
of certain mechanical systems in the second type of Lagrange form and isolating and
analyzing their stationary solutions. Described are certain aspects of the pro-
cedures for designing a mathematical model of the research object which is the basis
for the statement of the mathematical research problem and the algorithms for the
packages intended for finding numerical solutions to optimization problems of the
linear programming and optimal control types. A number of articles deal with
packages for numerical solution of boundary problems for ordinary differential
equations. Described in the latter articles in the section are the concluding
stages of research or its iteration in the final iteration process of problem re-
search. Describedare a package intended for analysis of dynamic properties of a
system or the solutions found for it (the package algorithm is based on the method
of Lyapunov vector functions); a decision-making package oriented to the method of
generating additional requirements, decision rules and criteria used to evaluate
solutions obtained and to selection of the best decision; and an interactive
computer-aided design system for complex systems by the criterion of reliability.

Articles in the third section of the collection cover packages oriented to specific
subject areas of applications. Discussed are packages for computer-aided design of
ground-effect machines. Described are software and computer systems for optimizing
the structure of the USSR unified electric power system, complex thermal power
facilities and multicircuit hydraulic systems. Finally, problems of developing a
subsystem for operational planning of vehicle transportation in construction are
discussed.

Included in the collection are articles discussed at the 2nd Siberian School for
Young Scientists and Specialists on the Technology of Developing Software Packages
held in July 1979 and which reflect the status of developments at that time.

Novosibirsk PAKB‘I'Y PRIXLADNYKB PROGRAm: HETODY I RAZMBUI'KI in Russian 1981
(signed to press 10 Aug Bl) pp 36-42

[Article by 8. L. Lidin, A. I. Yegorov and Yu. D. Savitskiy]
[Text] 1. Problem Statement

Designing automatic auditory image recognition systems (SARSO) is a major problem
in modern cybernetics and part of the overall problem of autonatic pattern recogni-
tion. There are many different domestic and foreign SARSO, but the problem evi-
dently is still a long way from definitive solution.

In general form, the SARSO design problem can be formulated as follows. The recog-
nition process consists of preprocessing of the source image, i.e. conversion of
the source pattern into some description, and decision-making proper, i.e. estab-
lishing the affiliation of the description obtained to a particular class. It is
evident that processing plays the main role in the recognition process since on the
one hand, there are few decision-making principles (usually five basic principles
are singled out) and they have all been developed and described to a sufficient
extent, and on the other, because it is precisely the preprocessing that determines
the form of the end description and, consequently, the selection of the decision-
making rule. Thus, the preprocessing process has to be optimized so that the
simplest possible decision-making rule is used (and, consequently, the least time
and equipment cost is required). Design of the optimal preprocessing scheme can

be formalized as follows.

Let us consider the problem of recognizing isolated words. Let us describe a speech
signal that is (in digitized torn) a sample of n values of a nonstationary random

process 88 an n-yector n
X (a. t) - (31(8. 0. x20. t). ..., Kn“: t))

that is dependent on the speaker s and the uttered word t. Thus. if k1 speakers
utter k2 words each in common order, we will have the matrix
hxk. : 8 - IXM. tau. kJ. 1-H. kJ.

Let us call the columns of this matrix, made up of identical words uttered by the
different speakers, classes, and the rows, vocabularies.

116

FOI¢0FWKJAI.USE(H¥LY
Let us introduce a finite set. generally speaking, of nonsuitching statements that
convert the signal into a certain description:

la:.lp-|- -¢:" 0 I} ‘1' y”.

Let us also consider the compound statement

as: “H"
A =ﬁna" , (1)

where nk-mk-l’ nl-n. mM-m, Hap, which is an analog of a certain preprocessing scheme.

Let us define on the matrix 53 and the set of compound statements the discrete
functional

a [A] =

where D is a certain metric and u<<n(x,, X2) is a minor constant introduced to

eliminate a possible pole. The functional numerator is the maximum intraclass
spacing in the entire sample of patterns. The minimum interclass spacing is in the
denominator. By the value of A one can judge the applicability of a particular rule
for decision making. For example, when Ai<l, let us use the nearest neighbor method
and when A> l and the minimum interclass spacing is nonzero, the method of dividing
hyperplanes; when the minimum interclass spacing is zero (i.e. when pattern classes
intersect), one can use probability methods etc.

It is obviOus that the optimum "preprocessing scheme" will be the statement Appt
that minimizes the numerator and maximizes the denominator of the functional A:

where d - (A).

Thus, the problem is to select the most effective (in the sense of minimising A)
minimum combination of statements as”, with the nature of the speech signal itself

(randomness, nonstationarity, presence of various individual fluctuations etc.)
making it possible to use the facilities of correlation and spectrum analyses as

statements a2". And in fact. both domestic and foreign researchers use mainly these
facilities in particular combinations when designing SARSO.

2. General Description of Package

He developed a software package to simulate various preprocessing methods in auto-
matic pattern recognition systems that implements the approach described above. The
package has its own input language ("problem statement language") that meets the re—
quirement of being unenct-bered with regard to procedural orientation, being natural
like and consequently suitable for the user who is not too faniliar with computer
programming.

The purpose of the package is the facilitate developmentz optimization and verifi-
cation of the serviceability of the various preprocessing methods through numerical
experiment based on an arbitrary amount of experimental acoustical information.

This package includes a program to translate the package input language and a
library of subroutines from which the source program is generated. The package
functions under control of ASVT DOS [nodular Computer System, Disk Operating System].
In the general case, the sequence of operation of the package looks like this (see
fig. 1). From the DOS phase library, the translator program, placed there before-

 

Fig. 1.

hand, is loaded. It processes the package input language program, input from
cards, and compiles the output program on a tape file. In the process, errors can
be corrected and some parameters input from the system console. After completion
of the operation, the translator is unloaded and the output program is processed
by 008 facilities. The subroutine library is placed in the DOS module library and
it is also accessed automatically. Two tape units are required for package opera-
tion: a data file and a source program file, also used as the working file.

3. Subroutine Library

The subroutine library has about 50 modules, conventionally divided into basic and
auxiliary. The basic modules include implementations of the following algorithms:
discrete Fourier transform, fast Fourier transform by a two-point scheme with
thinning out by frequency, Laplace transform, fast Adsmar transfora, quasilinear
prediction based on autoregression model, computation of autocorrelation and cross-
correlation functions, introduction of (uahn) window, signal or spectrum clipping
at some absolute or relative threshold, determination of signal energy in a
specified frequency band, determination of frequency of intersection by a signal of
a given level, isolation of formant frequencies, etc.

116

F03<NﬂﬂCJAL.USE|)NLY
The fast Fourier transform algorithm is described in detail in [1, 2]. As is known,
when a fast Fourier transform [PFTJ'is used on the dimension of an array, the

limitation n
“-2 (2)

is imposed, where m is an integer, but the PYT requires Nlogzh operations of

complex multiplication instead of N2, which permits a substantial reduction in
computation time.

The Adams: transform is a rotation group statement. The matrix N x N of the Adamar
transform is specified by the recurrent formula ”

"In ”N121 1 1
”"" [”N,: —lhml' "'“It _1]'

It is evident that on the dimension of an array to be transformed, the same limita-
tion (2) is imposed as in the EFT by a two-point scheme. The graph of computation
of the fast Adamar transform (EPA) is shown in fig. 2. Structurally, it is identi-
cal to the FFT computation graph, but only addition (solid lines) and subtraction
(broken lines) operations occur in it. The order of the elements of the array to
be transformed is simply changed to the inverse, instead of the inversion of binary
multiindexes required in the PFT. The FFT and fast Adamar transforms can be used
both independently and in more complex procedures, such as in the generalized.
Uiener filtering procedure [3].

Seelected for the quasilinear prediction
procedure was an autoregression model,
i.e. a model, the transfer function of
which has only poles and no nulls, since
this model best describes the speech
signal {4].

The auxiliary modules include subroutines
to convert data types (for example, con-
version of a source array of one-byte
integer numbers into a similar array of
complex eight-byte numbers, and vice
versa), as well as to printout results,
including printing of graphs, histograms Fig. 2.

and the so-called visible speech with four

levels of quantization, subroutines for manipulation with the data file on the tape
unit and certain others.

 

4. Input Language and Translator

The SPARTAN (Speech Patterns Automatic Recognition Translative Algorithmic
Notation) input language is a problem-oriented language essentially fully machine-
independent. The SPARTAR translator is written in standard COBOL and makes use_of
FORTRAN as the base language.

117

FIHIC"ﬁﬂ(1AI.UEIZ(MNLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

A SPARTAN program consists of optional declarative statements, the F and 3 state-
meats. Declarative statements describe the experimental acoustic data (number of
words, speakers, device on which the informatiOn is located, blocking, size of
elementary data unit in bytes, frequency of acoustic signal quantization) and
characteristic features of system to be modeled (width and shape of window). If
the declarative statements are omitted, default values are assured for these
parameters.

F statements are FORTRAN statements. They are essentially not processed by the
translator and included in the output program without change.

S statements consist of mandatory instructions and optional explanation. The
sequence of instructions describes the structure of the transformation (1) and is

a program for processing experimental information. Explanations are used to
declare types of variables and dimensions of arrays mentioned in the instructions.
Thus, in contrast to other programming languages, SPARTAN does not require de- '
claration of variables and arrays at the start of a program (subroutine, block),
although the task of declaring objects as they appear in a program is also handled
for simple variables (but not for all types and not for arrays) in some languages,
such as in FORTRAN and PL/l. The explanation begins uith the key word WHERE and is
processed separately, irrespective of instruction contents. The problem of declar-
ing variables and arrays as they appear in the program has been resolved because
(and only because) the SPARTAN translator is a complete preprocessor of the FORTRAN
translator. During scanning of the SPARTAN program, the explanations generate the
first, declarative portion of the output program, and the instructions generate the
second, executable protion.

In addition to a proper identifier, an object (variable, array) in SPARTAN can be
referred to by using the reserved word IT. IT refers to the last object mentioned
in a given or preceding instruction. The language also has another reserved word
that replaces an identifier, ELEMENT or EL. EL refers to an element, i.e. a one-
dimenaional subarray of fixed length, selected out of an array of experimental data.

The SPARTAN translator provides for partial interaction without using special sys-
tems. .If work is being done in the interactive mode, then the translator, after
detecting the absence of a particular declarative statement, sends an inquiry on
the appropriate parameters to the system console. The user inputs the required
declarative statement or the message "STANDARD" from the console. STANDARD effects
the default conditions. Nhen a syntax or orthographic error is detected in an S
statement being examined, the translator puts out the statement text and an error
message on the system console. From the console, the user inputs the corrected
text or indicates discontinuance of interaction by the message "N0 DIALOGUE."

This partial interaction, naturally, is not very applicable in large systems, but
is convenient in operating with computers of small configurations.

The SPARTAN translator also executes certain control functions. Thus, for example,
when an instruction to subject some array to a Fourier transform is encountered,
the translator determines the overall length of the array (the array does not have
to be one-dimensional) and if condition (2) is met, includes a call to the FFT sub-
routine in the source program; otherwise, a call to the DP? [discrete Fourier
transform] subroutine is included. If the named array is not complex, it is
automatically transformed into such, etc.

118

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
Since low-level machine-oriented languages are not used in the package, and COBOL
and FORTRAN compilers are available in many modern operating systems, it should
evidently be noted that a rather high mobility of the package has been achieved in
contrast to, say that of the "GRAB" package [5], written in autocoder-ITM and
strictly oriented to the BBSM-é. It should also be noted that the subroutine
library can be utilized fully even without the SPARTAN translator. In this case,
the package input language will be a set of references to the available subroutines
in a manner similar to, say the GRAPOR package [6).

He have made provision for future expansion of the subroutine library and, since

the package translator is easily expanded and added to, a corresponding increase in
the number of possible instructions in the input language.

[Excerpt] Ever greater interest has been shown recently in using computers to per-
form analytic computations. Encountered often in practice is the necessity of
operating with unwieldy analytic expressions that are extremely difficult or inpos-
sible to transform In many cases. using coaputers per-its bypassing the diffi-
culties associated with a large volune of analytic conputations and eliminating
the errors of annual computation. It is therefore no coincidence that special
programing languages and systems for analytic computations (SAV) are being
developed.

All analytic computation systens can be conventionally divided into general-purpose
and specialised. General-purpose systens have a large number of built-in capa-
bilities and therefore take up a great deal of main storage and require large time
inputs. Specialized systems are oriented to a specific subject area. Typical of
these systems is high speed and relatively minor requirenents for aain storage site.

An exhaustive survey of available analytic computation systens is not our goal here.
Let us just mention the program facilities used in our country. Among the early
donestic systems are the ARALITIK [1] language for the Mir-2 computer and the
SIRIUS system for the “-222 [2]. These general-purpose systems have not received
due application; this is apparently due to the impossibility of solving the
serious problas associated with processing of symbolic information on those
computers because of limited aachine resources. These general-purpose facilities
should also be mentioned: the LISP [3] and REPAL [lo] languages, the AVTO-ANALITIK
[5] system, and the analytic computation system for operation with Poisson series
[6. 7]. The foreign aystens, SCHOORSHIP, CLAN and REDUCE-2, have been introduced
at the OlYaI [Joint Institute of Nuclear Research] in Dubna. A survey of these
and other systems is available in [8].

Described in this article is an analytic computation system for solving problems of
mechanics and a software package for analysis of stationary motions of mechanical
systems, that has been implemented on the basis of this system on the MESH-6
computer in the ALGOL-Gnu language [9]. The main reason for initiating development
of this systen was the lack of facilities for matrix-vector algebra on symbolic
objects in the known domestic systems. (The SIRIUS system [2] is an exception.)

120

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
The orientation of this system to processing expressions of a specific structure
has made it possible to substantially simplify certain algorithms and perform
transformations that are either inefficient or unacceptable for the general type of
expressions. Systen implementation based on a language with a computational
orientation, which AWOL-60R is, has enabled a natural transition from the symbolic
form of representation of expressions to computation of their numerical value.

[Article by A. I. Zholudev and A. I. Datyushkin]

[Excerpts] Discussed in this article are the computational schemes of two linear
programing methods that start the operation from a specified plan and end computa-
tion upon reaching a specified approximation to the optimal plan. One of them, the
adaptive method [1], differs substantially from the simplex-method and operates
more efficiently with the main limitations of the type of inequalities. In its
structure, the other, the reference method [2]. is close to the simplex-method and
allows multiplicative representation of an inverse matrix, which is a significant
advantage in solving problems of large dimension. Both methods have been
implemented in ALGOL-60 and applied for solving a nuber of linear programing
problems.

2 .3. Numerical Implementation

The algorithm described was implemented in ALGOL-60 (ALGOL-60R). The computational
procedure implementing it uses a multiplicative scheme of representation of an
inverse reference matrix with compact storage of the multipliers, which permits
econuic use of computer storage and reduces problem solving time. An MD [magnetic
disk] is used to store the inverse mtrix. Exchange between main storage and the
MD is performed in complete zones, i.e. in files with a length of 10210 words, with
an integer number of multipliers being stored in each zone. A buffer file with a
length of 10210 words, to which new multipliers are written, is used to reduce the
number of accesses to the MD. After it is filled, it is copied to the next HD zone.

Matrix A is stored in conpact form on HI. [magnetic tape]. To speed up computation,
it can be copied to the MD or, for small problems, to computer main storage.

This procedure was used to solve a series of problems in the model REGION, developed
at the 1310?? 50 AN 8881! [Institute of Economics and Organization of Industrial
Production, Siberian Branch, 0588 Academy of Sciences]. Sizes of the matrix of
limitations ranged from 168 to 660 rows and from 608 to 4200 columns. Time to solve
one problem was 3-58 minutes. Maximum errors in rows on the optimal solution did

not exceed 10-6.

[Text] Applied in this work is the modular principle for developing a software
package intended for investigating aerodynamic factors and the lift/drag ratio

of carrier systems and flying vehicle as a whole as it loves close to the fluid
boundary; fits and criteria of static stability during notion in the stationary
node, deterninate flight dynamics, investigation of amplitude-frequency character-
istics of apparatus; optimization of the basic carrier systen and selection of the
paraaeters of design schemes for flying vehicles [1, 2].

The aain aim in developing this package was to put into the hands of the investiga-
tor and user-developer of new types of flying vehicles an effective tool for multi-
variant analysis of various phenomena associated with notion of flying vehicles.
This is done by creating a library of special subroutines, the use of which requires
no knowledge of methods and algorithms.

1. Package Subject Area

The essence of the subject area is conposed of research on problels of notion of
bodies in a restricted flow. A large nunber of the problena in the package are
united by the cannon problem of airfoil notion in a restricted fluid. A typical
problen is that of the notion of an airfoil of arbitrary goo-atry in an ideal fluid
close to a solid surface. The boundary problen corresponding to it, notated in

terns of velocity.pofential, has the form [3, 6]

~awn—chm (CS; o.-0, {-0; [Pl-0. (6L: (1)
[Pl-0. (-2; o-ml.... ('9: '99-.0, z-N».

Here 0 is the disturbance velocity potential, 0 is the area occupied by the fluid,
g is the current point coordinate, s is the airfoil, L is the trailing edge of the
surface S, t is the surface of turbulent disturbances, P is the pressure in the
fluid flow. z-n(x.Y) is the airfoil equation, 90 is the initial value of ve1ocity
potential and (Vn, Vs) is the scalar product in tuo-dinenaional Euclidean space.

As a rule. introduced into consideration in the case of minor disturbances is
acceleration potential and the boundary problems are solved by the methods of the
theory of acceleration potential_[lsl. In problem (1), the solutions are functions
of the characteristic parameter h (h is the relative distance) and varicus algo-
rithms and asymtotic theories are applied as a function of its value.

Implemented for '5! 15.. 0°). ‘1‘“0‘8) are algorithms of the asymtotic method of func-
tional parameters (HIP). Used in the m is the grOup comparison scale

(1‘) ot=V(i+4h;)—23 and solutions are sought in the form of the asymtotic

series 9-%+WI+ m+.,,+1'9.+o(x-“), Rather complete intonation on the

m is contained in [5]. For values :-f h ~0(c), quadrupole theory__[6] allows making
considerable simplifications in type (1) boundary problems. when h #0, there is a
certain singular confluence of problem (1). A regular asymtotic algorithm for
solving this singularly perturbed problem is provided by quadrupole airfoil theory.
In the first approximation of quadrupole theory. the singular confluence of problen
(l) in the case of stationary motion of the wing has the form of a boundary problem
for the flow under the wing [7]

Av-O. 3.0-;
vn-(Vn.V9)+On/8¢. (ES; (2)
e.-0. 3-0; «pa-0. (2L; A9»0. 2-H».

where a is the area under the wing.

Algorithms for solving specific problems based on problem (2) also are the basis
for the unit of modules for analysis of the aerodynamic performance of airfoils.

This package contains certain generalizations of problem (1) within the bounds of
perturbation theory. They include mathematical models of motion in proximity to a
free surface of heavy fluid of hydrofoils [3] and generation of ship waves and wave
drag when there are turbulent perturbations behind the body [6]. Formulation of
the boundary problem in these cases takes the form of (l) with replacement of the
boundary condition on the solid screen by the known conditions of the theory of
waves of small amplitude. In stationary problems, these conditions are notated as:

...--

9.-|a9.+e.9.-0. 1-0. (3)

where u is the coefficient of dissipative forces, approaching zero in the final
results; or l/2Fr2 and Fr is the Proude umber. Algorithms for the analysis of
hydrodynamic performance are constructed by using the HF? just as in the corres-
ponding algorithms for problal (l). The difference is that with the lack of con-
fluence of the main integral operator of the problem when hl +0, the results extend
to the entire parametric interval

The theory of ship waves and wave drag is represented in the package by stationary
problems on motion over a surface of heavy fluid of certain compact regions of in-
creased pressure or solid bodies (systaaa of bodies). Used in the first case are
classical algorithms for the theory of waves of small amplitude [91. and in the
second (and in combination with the first case). the theory of ship waves with

turbulent perturbations behind the bodies [6]. Solutions to these problems have
been implemented in the form of regular’asymptoticalgorithms with local incorrect-
ness. Enlisted to obtain the unique solution to problems of this type is the
apparatus of the theory of proper solutions [6] which enables simulating the genera-
tion of turbulent structures on the knife edges of body surfaces or spray jets in
the theory of gliding. when the algorithms mentioned above are added to the
package, one can investigate systems having lifting elements both under and-above
the free surface of the fluid.

All required information on problems (l)-(3) of the theory of acceleration poten-
tial and quadrupole theory is contained in [2-6]. In this package, a mathematical
model of three-dimensional aircraft motion is synthesized in the "dynamics" model
which primarily haplements algorithms of longitudinal aircraft dynamics in
restricted fluid. Owing to the specifics of aircraft which make use of the effect
of a supporting surface, there are many grounds for considering a large number of
problems of dynamics in linear approximation. This is precisely why problems of
linear approximation are represented in this software package.

The "dynamics" module includes four separate versions of a mathematical model of
three-dimensional aircraft motion. The fact is that a characteristic feature of
any transport object is the presence of two groups of operating situations that are
designed' and that determine a basic problem of optimal design: (1) cruising mode
of motion governed by the purpose of object functioning and assumed to be usually
designed when the economic and operating-technical indicators of design operation
are established; and (2) critical situations that are designed for selection of
design solutions that afford durability, survivability in emergency situations,
specified dynamic object characteristics, etc. Assrule, these situations are
described by equations of aircraft disturbed motion. The range of hydroaerodynamic
problems subject to solution in the first and second cases is substantially differ-
ent. Thus, while in the first version it is found possible to stay within the
bounds of stationary gratis: ::atementa. in the second, the nature of nonetationary
aircraft motion plays a major role in generating the mathematical model.

The first block in the module, an algorithm for computing aircraft position in
space (fit) during stationary motion at a fixed speed, is based on constructive use
of formulas for initial stability, widely known in ship theory, and the concept of
conventional metacentric height {6, 10]. The algorithm allows deriving the posi-
tion in space of an aircraft of arbitrary configuration as a function of the basic
independent variable in the algorithm, the Froude number, as well as the aerody-
namic performance corresponding to the given speed and the criteria of static sta-
bility, conventional metacentric height. The second and third blocks in the module
implement computation of transient processes of aircraft disturbed motion in a
quasistationary arrangement and with regard to nonstationarity of aerodynamic
factors.

In determining the aerodynamic factors from stationary theory, aircraft longitudi-
nal dynamics are described by a system of linear differntial equations. In deter-
mining aerodynamic factors from the theory of a wing in a nonstationary flow (see
problem 1), aircraft dynamics are described by a system of integral-differential
equations with Volterra operators having the form

r—Az-I-By, y=jx(2—¢,)z(t,)d¢,. z(0)-r.. (4)

In this case, additional difficulties arise that can be overcome by using an
exponential approximation of the nucleus of the integral Volterra operator. The
initial system of equations (4) is reduced to a system of differential equations
of substantially greater dimension ill].

The fourth block is an algorithm for computing aircraft path in takeoff/landing
modes in a quasistationary arrangement.

Algorithms for solving Cauchy problems for ordinary differential equations are based
onthe asymptotic method of small time (a partial implementation of the)!" [method
of functional parameters]). In this method, instead of physical time lilo, so) .

The time relationship is often provided by the formula r-i-s‘“. In numerical
computations of rigid systems of differential equations, the step for computing the
solution is very small because of the large values of the derivatives. Thanks to
the switch to small time, the calculation step can be increased and the type (6)
problem solved on large time intervals. This modification of the method of small
time is called the method of large steps. The advantages of the method of large
steps in a computational respect compared to a number of known methods have been

established by experience by savings on memory and computer efficiency.

A major problem in aircraft design is optimization of the lift system. The basic
difficulties in optimizing the lift system are most often of a computational nature
which imposes severe requirements on mathematical models of hydroserodynamica used
in extremal problems. The computational difficulties associated with application

of these models are overcome by quadrupole theory which is used as the basis in
formulating a large number of various extraaal problems. As a rule, these extremal
problems cover the following problem with meaningful formulation: finding the
optimal geometry of the lift complex that ensures minimum value of induced drag with
constant lift and various limitations.

There are different versions of extremal problems as a function of type of limita-
tions. Isolated in the software package are three groups of problems. The first
determines the optimal geometry of a wing of specified area and distance from the
screen; the second, the optimal wing with a specified center of pressure; and the
third is the problem on the optimal wing with constant seaworthiness. In physical
variables. the latter extremal problem is formulated as

here the aerodynamic portion of the problem is determined according to the quadru-
pole theory of the wing i121. In essence, this extremal problem (6) can be classi-
fied as a problem of optimal control of a system with distributed parameters. The
extremal problems in the package are investigated by methods of asylptotic

programing .

National Economy]

[Excerpts] The development (design, construction and installation of equip-
ment) of a We [computer center] is organized by the unified scheme regulated
by guiding eethodical materials of the State Comittee of the USSR Council of
Ministers on Science and Technology, State Standards and other normative and
technical documents of USSR Gosstroy and USSR Gosstandart.

A newly created computer center, like any new plant, passes through the so-
called stage of couposition in which three periods can be distinguished:
preparation for introduction, introduction into operation and assimilation of
couputer capacities. But insufficient attention is devoted to organizing the
stage of composition of the computer center. Therefore, preparation for in.-
troduction, introduction and assimilation are not substantiated beforehand in
the operating practice of computer centers and fulfillment of them depends on
the experience and intuition of individual executors.

Organizing the management of the production and economic activity of a com-
puter center at the stage of composition assuaes that all problem that de-
termine the composition and content, the sequence and methods of perforning
work to ensure timely and high-quality introduction of the computer center
into operation and assimilation of computer capacities will be worked out. In
this case the composition and content of work in organisation of production,
lﬂaor and planning differ from those during the period of indutrial operation.
Moreover, they vary during the three indicated periods.

The period of preparation toward operational status coincides by schedule with
the stage of developing the computer center when a new computer center is
planned, the building is constructed (or reconstructed) and the equipment is
installed and adjusted. The problem of providing everything necessary for
timely introduction of the computer center into operation and assimilation of
it is solved at this time.

following work be performed within specific deadlines: organization of effec-
tive monitoring of the planning and construction of the computer center, de-
livery, installation and adjustment of equipment, provision of selection and
training of qualified personnel, development of algorithms and problem-solving
technology, information stpport and programs of the computer center, provision
of experimental testing of planning solutions, development of operating in-
structions for personnel of the conputer center, training users for introdur
tion of modules processing of information, compilation of a schedule of organ-
irational assures (organisational plan) with respect to operational status
and assimilation of cosputer capacities and so on.

essence and designation of a computer center at the modern stage of development
of the organizational forms of utilizing cosputer technology. Indeed, develop-

its activity is usually not restricted to a specific closed automated system.
For example, most computer centers participate in formation of a state fund
of algorithm and programs and is contained in its system. And the functional
links of this fund of the computer center carry out the activity that goes be-
yond the limits of specific A80 [9]. The independence of a computer center

computer centers. Therefore, development of a computer center should be re-
garded as a fact of developing special subdivisions (enterprises) for infom-
tion processing with specific functions and tasks attached to them [7]. Fro-
this viewpoint the development with respect to an ASU can be compared to tech—
nical preparation of production for a computer center and its completion, i.e.,
introduction of the A80, should coincide with introduction of the computer
center into operation. The possibility of gradual increase of the computer

[hardware complex) of the computer center, separate production lines designed
to process information of specific complexes of problm, is now used exten-
sively, which was determined by the step by step design and introduction of
the 350. The feasibility of putting a computer center into operation in units

mining the composition and to selection of the efficient structure of starting
complexes has not yet been worked out. Therefore, the nmber and structure is
usually not substantiated. The problem of selecting a rational structure of

132

starting complexes and their composition is rather complex and requires
special investigation.

The considered method of putting a computer center into operation permits one
to accuwlate known experience of introducing the muter equipment, which is
then used in assimilation of subsequent units, which contributes to reduction
of the deadlines of putting the computer center into operation and accelerat-
ing the return of basic production funds of the computer center. However, a
number of deficiencies is observed in practical iuplementation of the given
method. For example, equipment is frequently introduced into operation that
is not provided with the necessary volume of computer operations due to the
untimely technical preparation of computer center production (due to lack of
readiness of programs and information support and so on) and lack of training
of computer center personnel and users. Analysis of the use of computers at
16 computer centers of the Ukrainian SSR TsSU [Central Statistical Minimis-
tration] system, developed in 1977, showed that the idle time during the first
six months after the computers were introduced into operation comprised an
average of 26.29 percent of the actual working time due to the absence of
work. The given percentage exceeded 60 percent at some of the considered
computer centers.

Moreover, when designing a computer center, the structure of the KTS is usu-
ally determined for the total inventory of problems to be solved without re-
gard to step by step introduction of them. Therefore, acquisition of a com-
puter with a complete set of information input~output and magnetic disk and
magnetic tape memory devices, with expanded capacity of internal storage and
also with a complete set of peripheral equipment is planned [7), which leads
to inefficient use of the computer resources and peripheral equipment.

The main cause of the indicated deficiencies is individual solution of prob-
lems of planning the organization of introduction of ms, determination of the
composition and structure of starting complexes (there are usually discrepan-
cies in the composition of the equipment to be put into operation and the re-
quirements of the problems to be solved at the computer center) and substan-
tiation of the priority of introducing starting complexes.

Besides the enumerated deficiencies, one of the deficiences of step by step
introduction of the MS of a computer center is too long a period of its turn,
during which the computers and production processes become obsolete in some
cases. The computer equipment introduced during the first stage may have to be
replaced and the technology of performing computer operations may have to be
replaced and sometimes the building of the computer center may have to be
redesigned by the time the computer center reaches full operational status.
This situation occurred at the end of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and at the be-
ginning of the 10th Five-Year Plan with regard to the appearance of third-
generation computers. To eliminate this deficiency. the capability of further
pre~ and re-equipping must be provided during design of the computer center or
the computer center must be put into operation as a whole.

In current practice of developing computer centers. the method of making the
m5 fully operational is difficult to realise since it requires considerable

acceleration of work in technical preparation of the computer center for
production and accordingly recruitment of considerable labor, material and
financial resources to support timely fulfillment of the operations, which
is not always possible. In the opposite case the computer capacities will
operate for a lung time in the underloaded mode and the technical and eco-
nomic indicators of computer center operation will be underestimated. More-
over, several computers cannotbe practically installed immediately and one
cannot receive the complete complement of makexm equipsent due to the strictly
limited distribution of computers, communications and other equipment (the
manufacturers usually do not produce finished us but develop individual com-
ponents of them over a mnber of years [1].

Development of a system of standards for the length of assimilation is of
important significance to solve the problem of accelerating the assimilation
of computer capacities.

Temporary standards for introduction and assimilation of computers. confirmed
by USSR Gosplan and USSR use, are now in effect [2]. The norm for the length
of computer assimilation within the indicated standards is understood as the
time from the day the docuaent for acceptance for operation is signed until
the standard average daily load is reached. The norms for the length of as-
similation are established with regard to productivity of computer classes
and comprise 0.5-1.5 years or 1-2 years if the first computer of a givmclass
is installed at the computer center.

We feel that the existing system of standards of assimilation has a number of
deficiencies and requires considerable finishing. The first disadvantage is
related to the fact that they are designed to monitor the level of assimila-
tion of computers put into operation. regardless of whether a computer is in-
stalled at a new or already operating computer center. As analysis showed,
the assimilation of a computer is considerably slowed down at a new computer
center, where the collective has not yet been selected and the production
process is mregulated.

The second disadvantage is that the standards are established without regard
to the dimensions of the computer center, operating modes, the complexity of
the problems to be solved, the degree of automation of the production process,
the nature of technical preparation of the computer center for production
(original development or using standardized components of the ASUnTRP (stan-
dard design solutions], PPP [applied program pack], SUBD (data base control
system] and so on) and also without regard to the newness of the equipment to
be assimilated (it is assimilated for the first time in the country or it is
assimilated for the second time).

The third disadvantage is that they take into account only one aspect of as-
similation of computer capacities-~technical assimilation. The indicators and
periods of adiieving economic, production and social assimilation have not
been established. At the same time one of the causes of prolonged assimila-
tion of computer capacities is that the technical and economic indicators to
be monitored, by the level of which one can judge the degree of assimilation
of computer capacities, have not been established at the cuspqu center.

As a result the level of the indicators, toward improvement of which the ef-
forts of the entire collective of a new computer center should be directed,
remains unmonitored.

It should be noted that standardization of the periods of assimilation of
computer capacities, although important, is not the basic factor that affects
the reduction of deadlines of assimilating the computer capacities of new
computer centers. Regardless of how well substantiated the standard deadlines
of assimilation are, observation of them depends primarily on the level of or-
ganization of work during periods of preparation for introduction. introduction
into operation and assimilation of computer capacities.

Plant management of their fulfillment is of decisive significance in providing
the corresponding level of organization work. The list of measures on prep-
aration for operational status is now presented in the contract design accord-
ing to the methodical and guiding materials, while the measures that ensure
that the computer center will be put into operation and assimilation are worked
out during the detail design phase. This is related to the fact that a number
of operations in organization of operational status and assimilation are per-
formed during the period of designing the computer center.

To intensify monitoring and the attention of management and workers of a new
computer center in the problems and difficulties of the stage of composition,
we feel that the plan (organizational plan) of organizing preparation for in-
troduction, introduction and assimilation can be formulated as a separate
document. A number of methodical problems--determination of the structure
and content of the organizational plan, the order, methods and deadlines of

developing it, substantiation of the period for which it is being developed
(for the entire stage of composition or individually for each phase of it) and

so on--must be solved.

Organization of accounting for the actual totals of fulfillment of the planned
organizational measures and creation of the doctsnent form of registering them
are also of important practical significance to improve management of the
process of establishing a computer center. This is indicated by the experi-
ence of operating the computer centers of the Ukrainian SSR TsSU system, made
available monthly as the "Report on entry and introducing into operation com-
puters and WK [punch card computer complex] (Form No 6 mechanical accounting),
the format of which is confirmed by decree No 249 of the USSR ‘l‘sSU, dated

29 March 1977. In this regard they keep a record and register the fulfillment
of certain measures of the period of preparation toward operational status:
receipt of the computer, preparation of the building, completion of specialist
training and putting the computer into operation. This was a factor that made
it possible to reduce the number of cases of excessive standard deadlines of
putting a computer into operation.

Thus, improvement of standardization, planning and accounting for the length
of each phase of the stage of composition is a considerable reserve for ac-
celerating the introduction and assimilation of computer capacities.

[Article by A. G. Nikolenko, assistant, Kiev Institute of the National Economy]

[Excerpts] The Ukrainian SSR occupies one of the leading places in development
of notor transport, the role of which is exceptionally high in solution of the
most important national economic problems of the republic. The Ukrainian SSR
Hinavtotrans [Ministry of Automotive Transport] combines more than 900 motor
transport enterprises. Approximately one billion tons of national economic
goods and 7.0 billion passengers are hauled annually by the motor transport of
the Ukrainian 883 and at the sane tine more than 100,000 different trucks and
turd: trains participate, providing the populace of the republic and more than
22,000 enterprises and organizations with transport service [2] .

Hanaganent of motor transport is a complex dynmic process characterized by
large volumes of processed information, laboriousness of performing management
functions. the need to find correct solutions within optimum deadlines and al-
so the relationship of functional indicators of individual structural sections
of the sector in the overall system.

Snell and medium enterprises-mar transport enterprises (ATP) , motor calms
(AK), service stations (sm), refuelling columns and so on predominate in the
quantitative sense in the structural plan within the Minavtotrans system. As
management facilities, the enterprises of motor transport have their own spe-
cific production process, which determines the characteristics in information
flows. the documents used. the time and principles of data formulation and the
methods and procedures of processing it.

One of the main conditions that contributes to a further increase of the in-
tensity and efficiency of operation of motor transport is extensive introduc-
tion of the advances of science and engineering and of leading technology into
production and improvement of management on the basis of using economic-mathe-
matical methods and computer equipment (VT).

A wide network of various types of computer installations (VU)--a main com-
puter center (GIVTs), multiple-user information computer centers (KIVTs) and
their branches. machine calculating stations (H53) and mechanized accounting

stations (HSB)--functions in the system of the Ukrainian SSR Minavtotrans.
ﬂoreover, a considerable number of small and medium enterprises utilise key-
board computers at the operators' positions of control apparatus or are ser-
viced by computer installations belonging to other ministries and agencies.

Analysis of the composition of the hardware utilized shows that the outputs:
centers of the Ukrainian SSR Hinavtotrans are equiped mainly with second- and
third-generation computers. The specific weight of the series Yes [Unified
Computer System] and hSV'l‘ [modular system of computer eguipent] computers
comprises approximately 80 percent, which is an important factor for organ-
ization of highly efficient systems of machine processing of data. At the
same time a considerable number of enterprises and organizations of the sec-
tor has low-power computer installations equippedwith keyboard and punch
equipment of obsolete models and that do not meet the increasing needs for in-
formation and calculating work.

Despite the fact that the needs br information and calculating work in the
sector are not being met, the average daily load of the computers throughout
the ministry as a whole is half the technical capabilities and fluctuates
within a considerable range at different computer centers. The low specific
weight of the useful operating time of the computers (approximately 40 per-
cent), the considerable amount of idle time (more than 10 percent) and also
the degree of computer concentration at the computer center-the load is high-
er where there are two or more machines--affect its level.

With the current forms of using computer equipment, each enterprise and or-
ganization is trying to have local VU [calputer installation] and to use their
own computers or other data processing hardware, which leads to dispersion of
computer equipment, disconnection of operating W and those being developed,
reduction of the load, duplication of planning work and increasing the cost

of data processing. All this sharply limits the capability of automation of-
management at the numerous small and medium enterprises, which are dominant

in the sector. These enterprises do not have sufficient volumes of informa-
tion to be processed to use a computer and in the absence of user stations
and the required number of communications channels can utilize the capabilities
and advantages of large computer installations.

The problems of improving the existing and development of a new system of ca:-
puter equipment use on a sector scale become timely in this regard. One of
the basic directions of improving the level of data processing is development
of a network of computer centers which permits a considerable increase in the
efficiency of using computer equipment and which provides future developent
of the most progressive forms of using it.

Based on investigation of the existing management structure of the Ukrainian
SSP Minavtotrans, the territorial disposition of enterprises and organisations
of the sector, the information flows circulating in the sector and also the
territorial disposition of functioning computer installations of the ministry,
the radial structure of the network of the Ukrainian SSR Hinavtotrans can be
used, which satisfies more fully the requirements placed on it.

[Article by Ye. 1. blank. V. A. Semenov and V. P. Shumilin]

[Excerpt] During th 10th Five-Year Plan much work was done in the USSR Ministry
of Power and Electrification to develop automatic systems for organizational and
economic control at the level of union and republic ministries. power systems.
and enterprises in the electricity networks.

In 1980 the second stage of the "Energiya" sector automated control system [OASU]
was connissioned. During 1979-80 the first stages of the republic automated control
systems [RASU] were put into industrial operation under the Ukrainian and Kazakh
ministries of power and electrification. In 1979 the second stage of the Uzbek

SSR Ministry of Power and Electrification RASU was brought into industrial operation.

By the end of 1981 automated control systems [ASU's] will be functioning in most
power systems. including in the 11 union republic power and electrification main
production administrations.

The control computer centers that have been organized in 80 power systems form
the technical base of the power system ASU's. During the 10th Five-Year Plan the
number of control computer centers more than doubled.

More than 60 percent of the tasks set for the power system ASU's are those of
organizational and economic control (bookkeeping. control of energy marketing.
material-technical supply. control of power repairs and so forth).

with each passing year there is an increase in the number of subdivisions and
enterprises that utilize the results from machine problem-solving. In 1980

machine time for solving problems of organizational and economic control was

spread as follows (mean values for 66 power systems): regional power administration
(economic planning department) subdivisions. 7b.7 percent. power system enterprises
25.3 percent. Centralized bookkeeping uses 20.7 percent of machine time and
maintenance and operating services for electrotechnical and heat-technical
equipment. the operation of the electricity networks. reliability and technical
safety and so forth. 6.8 percent; the departments of material-technical supply

138

FOR‘OFFICLAI.USE()NLY
and fuel and transportation service. 3.5 percent. the planning section 2.7 percent.
and the personnel department. labor and wages section. and laboratory scientific
organization of labor 1.9 percent.

0f the power system enterprises. the most active are energy marketing (energy
inspection) and the enterprises of the electricity networks. which use 8.9 and
7.1 percent of machine time respectively.

The Kiev Power System, the Latvian Main Power System. the Volgograd Power System.
the Novosibirsk Power System and other power systems make extensive use of the
computers.

Bookkeepers at a number of power systems (the Donbas Power System. the Odessa Power
System. the Smolensk Power System. the Chelyabinsk Power System. the Volgograd
Power System and so forth) use 3.000-5.000 hours of machine time annually to solve
bookkeeping tasks (calculating the movement of commodity and material value. fixed
capital. financial—calculation operations and so forth).

Power systems are making increasing use of the Yes-9002 and Yes-9004 devices to
prepare data on organizational and economic control tasks. which enables hundreds
of thousands of punch cards to be saved each year.

In a number of power systems (the Belorussian Main Power System. Dnepr Power System.
Donbas Power System. Kiev Power System. Khar'kov Power System. Moldavian Main Power
System. Rostov Power System and so forth). three to six reference stations have

been set up for initial data processing. These stations are equipped with punch
accounting machines and keyboards. and in individual cases. with a computer (the
Donetsk mobile power station. the Uglegorsk and Voroshilovgrad GRES's of the Donbas-
Power System». Problems of organizational and economic control are solved at the
reference stations. which makes it possible to remove some of the load from the
administration computer center in the power system.

During the 10th Five-Year Plan work was started on the development of an automated
control system for electricity networks. based mainly on the computers installed

at the power system administration computer centers. In the mobile power stations
themselves there is data transmission equipment or teletype machines for communicating
with the administration computer center. In individual cases invoicing machines

are installed in the mobile power stations.

In most power systems that have introduced an automated control system improved
labor productivity has been achieved with nominal redundancy of something of the
order of 1.300 personnel during the 10th Five-Year Plan. Improvements in labor
productivity are being achieved through resolving dispatcher problems (computation
of set regimes. stability. short circuits and so forth). mass accounts with the
consumers of electric power and heat. bookkeeping tasks. and monitoring of power
maintenance. for example:

in the Dnepr. Donbas and L'vov power systems. during the period that the ASU's
have been functioning 209. 185 and 145 persons respectively have been made redundant;

in the Smolensk Power System the transfer of bookkeeping to the computer has made
it possible to significantly improve the labor productivity of bookkeepers and

139

to use the name number to process a large increase in the amount of information;
nominal reduction of personnel has been 37 persons;

use of the computer in the eastern networks of the Latvian Kain Power System has
made it possible to reduce labor costs for accounting and working up estimtes
for capital repairs on the electricity networks from 7 to 0.5 men per month. and
search time to find damage on power transmission lines from 6.10 to 3.1 hours.

During the 11th Five-Year Plan work on the ASU development in power engineering
will be continued. Further improvement and development of the ”Energiya" OASU
is planned. along with operation of the second stage of the RASU's for the Kazakh
and Ukrainian ministries of power and electrification. During this work further
expansion of tasks solved will take place on the basis of the more extensive use
of data banks. dialogue systems. and the integration of data streams both within
the framework of the "Energiya" OAS“ and the RASU's. and between the levels
(communications with the power system ASU's).

New programs will be constantly written for the Yes operating systems using data
banks tested within the sector (the "Elektra" input data control system, the
economic intonation system and SB‘I'OR [expansion unknownl).

Dialogue systems will he used mainly for inputting and outputting operational data.

The first stages of. ASU's will be commissioned in 28 power systems. The power
system ASU's introduced during the Seventies will he further developed.

Yes-1022 COMPUTERS IN AUTOMATED CONTROL SYSTEMS
Hoscow STEKLO I KBRAMIKA in Russian No. 3, Mar 82 p 29

[Article by Yu.V. Petrov, deputy chief of the Automated Association Management
System Department and S.V. Petelin, chief of the Programming Office, Konakovo
Glazed Earthenware Plant imeni H.I. Kalinin: "Experience with the Efficient
Utilization of the Yes-1022 Computer in Automated Control Systems"!

[Text] In our plant, the first stage of an ASU [automated control system] based
on the Minsk-32 computer and punched card/tape machines was placed in service
in l97h.

Bookkeeping tasks were carried out using the punched card/tape machines, where
the most important of these tasks in terms of the volume of data processing
were labor and wage accounting, banking and cash flow operations, as well as
accounting for the arrival and movement of material valuables. production pro-
cess wastes and breakage.

The Minsk-32 computer was used to solve problems of quarterly, monthly and
daily planning of product output by the main production shops (all the way ,
down to sections and shifts) and operational monitoring of plan execution
at the same level, as well as a number of problems for economic planning ser-
vices.

The problem oriented "Tver'" software, developed just as the system as a whole,
by the Tsentrogranusistema scientific production association was taken as the
basis for the Minsk-32 computer software.

After the system was in place, the collective of the computer center of the plant
developed and executed tasks in the standard Cobol language for the Minsk-32
computer.

Operational experience with the system has demonstrated the effectiveness of the
decisions which were made and the high level of its development. Thanks to

the automation, the labor intensity of bookkeeping and analysis has been sig-
nificantly reduced. The economic planning subsystem has sade it possible to
provide for centralized production of differentiated plans for product produc-

tion as well as operational nonitoring of their execution. something which has

161

FOI¢NHNC1A1.USE(NNLY
FOR OFFIOAL USE ONLY

played an important role in establishing a steady work cycle for the plant as a
whole.

The very existence of computer hardware in the plant and the presence of special~
ists has made it possible for plant services to put forward additional require-
ments to be placed on the realization of more complete automation of management
functions. The necessity of expanding the functions of the A80 in the plant

at the present time is also explained by the fact that a department of the
automated control system for the republic level industrial association Roaprom-
farfor [RSPSR China Industry Administration] was created based on the computer
center, and in 1980. the association A50 (A500) based on the Yes-1022 computer
was brought on line.

The expansion of the computer fleet has caused serious problems. First of all,
it has become necessary to improve the level of servicing of the equipment which
is in operation and to master fundamentally new third generation conputer hard-
ware, something which is complicated by the large number of different types

of equipment in a computer center. Thus, electronic keyboard calculators and
adding machines are used in the manual information processing section; in the
sorting section. tabulators and totalizing card/tape perforators are used; and
digital perforators are used in the section for data preparation using punched
cards/tapes. Peripherals for repairing data on punched cards and tape, as well
as teletypes for data preparation on five punched tape tracks are also used

for the Minsk-32 and Yes-1022 computers.

All of this creates definite difficulties when processing the information simul-
taneously in all sections.

An analysis of the situation which has arisen showed that the most effective
results for assuring the development of both the plant A80 and the association
ASU can be obtained through improving the technological suitability of data
processing on the Yes—1022 computer. The following directions for the modern-
ization of Yes-1022 computer software were selected:

-The use of magnetic tapes only for copying information for the purpose of
duplication;

—-The maxinum possible exclusion of the role of the computer operator in the
data processing within the framework of the given task;

-~Standardization of the preliminary data processing operations on the computer.

The assumption has been made in this case that one disk pack of a store with
a capacity of 29 megabytes for data storage is sufficient for functioning of
the association ASH, including the programs and one working pack. The third
pack was set aside for the translators. A procedure governed by regulations
has been introduced for copying a functioning pack at the level of one genera-
tion.

Since the problem solving process or the translation process does not require
more than two disk drives following modernization, a system reserve has been

[Excerpts] Design of the National Automted System of Scientific and Technical
Information [NASNTI] in Bulgaria was oriented toward up-to-date technical facilities
and a developed terminal network. All the sector systems of scientific and technical
information in the country and their information organs have access to data bases
located at the Central Institute of Scientific and technical Information [’IsIN'rIl.
the cmtrsl organ of NASNTI. Data bases covering an extensive range of subjects

and of interest to a large number of users are concentrated in its automted

information center.

The sector system for scientific medical infatuation uses data bases set up within
‘rsIN'l‘I on the basis of data files stored on magnetic tapes obtained from other
countries and their specialised international systems. At this time its central
organ. the Center for Scientific Information on ladicine and Public Health [TsNtHZ]
with a central medical library to serve its users. employs the following data bases:

1. H515 NIR. series "Medicine. Pharmacology and the Medical Industry. contains
data on scientific research work done in the socialist countries and dissertations

in the field of medicine.

Since 1981. every 3 months 'l'sNIHZ has nade available current information from this
data base for scientific reseaerch institutes of the Bulgarian Hedical Academy.

2. INIS (International Nuclear Information System). an international information
system on nuclear energy.

Information on nuclear medicine, radiology and radioisotope diagnostics from this
data base (bibliographic references and abstracts in English) is made available
monthly as selective distributions of information in the form of machine printouts
for 160 users. mainly from the X-ray and radiology and oncology scientific research
institutes.

and public health. 10 percent on zoology and 10 percent on general biology.

Each year more than 260,000 documents are inputted to the system; they consist
of books and articles from 8,000 periodical medical journals and collections of
materials from conferences and syuposiums.

One serious defect in the use of the data bases formed in other countries is the
difficulty in accessing primary sources. which quite frequently are not available
in the countries working with these bases.

The BIOSIS data bank satisfies 60-65 percent of the information requirements of
physicians in Bulgaria.

Interactive mode and a flexible search strategy when using the TsINTI data bases
are insured through the utilization in the Bulgarian NASNTI of the STARS/V8 applied
prgram package--(Storage and Information Retrieval System). a system for storing
and retrieving document information in natural language.

In the sector system of scientific medical information. dialogue facilities are
also used for data retrieval in the "Milt" data base. This data base has been
created within the framework of the International System of Scientific liedical
Information in the Socialist Countries (HEDINPmH) which includes Bulgaria. Hungary.
the GDR, Cuba. Poland, the USSR and Czechoslovakia; scientific medical information
is exchanged on magnetic tape.

Individual organs of scientific medical information in these countries process
their own national medical literature. record it on magnetic tapes and send thee
to the base organ. which function is fulfilled by the 1'st and TaIN'l'I of Bulgaria.

The base organ codaines the data bases on mgnetic tape into a common file. mites
copies for the participants and sends each participant one copy of the aggregate
f ile, and it accumulates data on the aggregate files onto the magmatic disks of
the "Hedik" data base.

Each year 10,000 documents from the MEDINPORH eomtriee are inputted to the "Hedik"
data base.

The reports were divided into the following groups by topic in the section
“General design principles and software of analog-digital computer equipment
and analog computer equipment."

1. Structural organization and simulation of analog-digital computer equip-
ment and analog computer equipment. Reports and brief communications were
heard during the discussions devoted to the principles of simulation model-
ling of parallel structures. problems of designing integration equipment for
a two-level computer network. means of organizing work in design of analog-
digital computer systems and software.

2. The software of analog-digital computer systems. A system for automation
of compilation of analog-digital programs that provides automatic compilation
of the program for analog-digital computer systems in FORTRAN with description
of the input problem in high-level input languages, proposed and developed at
NIIscheunash [Scientific Research Institute of Calculating Hachines] was con-
sidered in the reports and comunications. Problans of designing systems
software for single- and two-level analog-digital computer systems and also
systems for autanation of compilation of analog and analog-digital programs
were considered.

3. Methods and accuracy of solving problems and problem-oriented complexes.
Various aspects of constructing the -hods for modelling multidimensional
reciprocal problems for differential equations of parabolic and elliptical
types with regard to their incorrect postulation. hybrid methods of solving
operator equations with high accuracy and applied software for modelling vari~
ous dynamic systems were considered in the reports and communications. Prob-
lems of constructing algorithms and programs to carry out preliminary proces-
sing of analog signals by microprocessors and systems for automated input and
display of analog information using analog and analog-digital calputer equip-
ment were discussed.

4. Machine methods of solving boundary-value problems. The structures of hy-
brid systems with analog network processor oriented toward solution of equa-
tions with partial derivatives were considered. The network models contained
in the system contain both fixed parameters and commutation of assemblies and
also regulated parameters and variable commutation of assemblies.

The report of K. A. Babordin, V. N. Skorik and A. Ye. Stepanov ”Problems of
Designing a Probabilistic Calculator for Solving Boundary-Value Problems”
presented by the Institute of Problems of Simulation in Power Engineering,
Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences, in which a specialized probabilistic de-
vice designed to solve multidimensional boundary-value problems with canplex
forms of domain boundaries, evoked great interest. The use of the Monte Carlo
method and the corresponding algorithms for organization of calculations page
mits a significant reduction of the time required to solve the indicated prob-
lems compared to a digital computer.

It was noted that the absence of serially produced network models does not
contribute to developnent of hybrid methods of solving boundary-value problems.

INK-3 complex, control complexes of the SM M and models of the unified com-
puter system“ evoked great interest.

Attention was devoted in the report of G. V. Chalogo, 1. Ya. Shor and M. G.
Levin ”Prospects for design of systems for automation of design of a controlled
electronic device based on an analog-digital computer complex" to problems of
developing problem-oriented software.

In the final talk, the chairman of the organizing cosunittee Doctor of Technical
Sciences, Professor V. B. Ushakov sunlmarised the decisions made at the Fifth
Ail-Union Conference on Analog and Analog-Digital Computer Equipment, held in
1977.

mart) Septedaer 1981 aatked 70 years since the birth of the prominent Soviet
scientist Corresponding liesber of the USSR Acader of Sciences Aleksey Andre-

yevich Lyapunov.

A. A. Lyapunov was an erudite scientist who worked fruitfully in many fields
of science and who left a rich scientific heritage (a list of A. A. Lyapunov's
papers, which nutter 205 titles, is published in [1]). The descriptive theory
of sets, nathemtical statistics, geophysics, biology, cybernetics, philosophy
and pedagogy comprise an incomplete list of the fields in which A. A. 1.va
worked.

A. A. Lyapunov's personal passion for science was combined with the unusual
gift of attracting others to himself. Many successfully working scientists
are now either direct students of A. A. Lyapunov or students of his students:
those who experienced to one degree or another the influence of his scientific
ideas are even more numerous.

One of the characteristic features of A. A. Lyapunov's scientific activity
was his desire to work in new fields of science that had just become estab-
lished, introducing mathematical methods of investigation in then. A clear
exuple of this is his activity in cybernetics, which he began during the dif-
ficult years of its birth in our country. A. A. loyapunov played an exception-
ally inportant role in the establishment of cybernetics. The first article in
the 0858 in which the scientific content of cybernetios cans to light and in
which its place in the system of sciences was indicated was the article "Fun-
damental Features of Qbernetics,” written by A. A. Lyapunov jointly with

s. L. Sobolev and A. I. Kitov and published in the journal macs! P131380!!!
in 1955. In later years A. A. Lyapunov was involved in theoretical investi-
gations of the subject of cybernetics, classification of its basic directions
and analysis of its problems and methods.

A new science was outlined frosl different scientific directions, methods,
approaches and individual problems fron positions of dialectical materialism
and the swject of investigation and the range of fundasental problems were

determined. The results of these investigations are presented more clearly
in an article [2] written in 1968. 'lhe subject of cybernetics is defined in
this article in the following manner: "cybernetics is the science of the
general principles of constructing control systems and the flow of control
processes."

In an article [3] that reveals a collection of the most significant works of
A. A. Lyapunov in the field of theoretical and applied cybernetics. the follow-
ing is stated: "A. A. Lyapunov carried out extensive work in comprehending
the fundamentals of cybernetics, precise definition of its subject and class-
ification of the basic concepts and problem.” To this should be added that
the establishment of such sections of cybernetics as programing, mathematical
biology, machine translation and mathematical linguistics is related to A. A.
Lyapunov's name.

A. A. Lyapunov's cybernetics period of activity encompasses the last 20 years
of his life and begins with investigations in programing. This occurred at
the beginning of the 1950: during the appearance of the first Soviet computers.
A. A. Lyapunov was among those who immediately appraised the great revolution-
izing role of computers in the life of man. let us present the words with
which begins the report that he prepared with his colleagues for the session
of the USSR Academy of Sciences in automation in 1956 (see [3]):

”Modern electronic calculators have created a revolution in the field of ap-
plication of mathematical calculations in natural science, engineering. eco-
nomics and other fields, having much expanded the range of problems accessible
to mathematical investigation. However, the significance of mathematical,
logical and engineering principles that are the basis for development of slow
tronic calculators goes far beyond the field of design and application of
mathematical calculators themselves. These principles can be applied to de-
Velopment of a nunber of new automatic devices that free the human brain from
performing many functions, the process of which can be described by a specific
sequence of logic or arithmetic operations. Among these functions can be
named those such as control of a number of production processes. dispatching
in production or transport, processing and sampling of various types of in-
formation. translation from one language to another and so on.“

The problems that comprised the theme of "artificial intelligence.’I as this
scientific direction is now called, were actually formulated in this report.

A. A. Lyapunov became involved in determination of the principles of computer
design from the first days of their appearance and at the time of the report
the operator method of program that he developed had already achieved wide
distribution both in practical programing and in courses on the teaching of
programing.

The operator method of programming was first outlined in detailed form by

A. A. Lyapunov in a series of lectures on programing that he read during the
academic year of 1952/1953 for students of the chair of computer mathematics,
mechanical and mathematics faculty, mu [Moscow State University]. This
course was then repeated many times to a wider audience. It was never

155

published as a whole, but individual chapters of it were used in [4-6) that
were published only in 1957-1958.

In [5] A. h. Lyapunov formulated the problem of programming as a scientific
direction and it consists in working out efficient methods of program compila-
tion to solve problems on high-speed automatic digital cmputers.

for these purposes A. A. Lyapunov first replaced the variety of real computers
by a single abstract machine that still embodied the basic features of design
and functioning of real machines; he called it a conditional computer (see
[5]). Its description is essentially an outline of the principles of design-
ing computers, which in itself had great scientific value. The conditional
computer became the bench to work out on it the procedures of programming and
demonstration of the operator method in action.

Rational methods of program compilation can be developed only if there is a
“rational" language to describe the algorithms to be prograsnsedna programing
language. At this time the theory of algorithms had at its disposal several
languages (Turing's machine, normal algorithms and recursive functions). How-
ever. none of them met the requirements which were placed on programing
language (true at the cognitive level). This nonconfornity follows from the
difference of goals which are followed in developing language of the theory of
algorithms and programming language. In the first case A. A. Lyapunov defines
these goals thusly (see [7]): ”The overall desire in development of systems
of concepts in the theory of algorithms consists in reducing the umber of
elementary acts to a minimum and to maximum standardization of them. This
significantly facilitates the establishment of the nonexistence of algorithms
of one or another type.“ Talking in the same reference about programing
language. A. A. Lyapunov notes: "Its purpose is to provide a convenient form
of describing algorithms that are used to solve one or another problems.”
Thus, a new language was required.

The language that A. A. Lyapunov proposed was named the apparatus of logic
circuits. It was written at the cognitive level. The elements from which
programming algorithms are "made up” are determined within this apparatus:
these are the operators that accomplish the act of information processing and
the logic conditions that accomplish the act of information verification in
order to determine the order of fulfillment of the operators. The description
of the algorithm by operators and logic conditions was called the logic cir-
cuit of the algorithm by A. h. Lyapunov. '1‘»: levels of description--counting
circuit and flow chart-were envisioned. A. h. Lyapunov defines these levels
of description and their relationship with each other in the following manner
(see (7]):

”The logic circuits of algorithms are used in programing in two different
forms. On the one hand, the initial task (problem-solving algorithm-authors)
is represented in the tom of a logic circuit. Only the operators used to
process the initial data of the problem are taken into account here. 'mese
circuits are called counting circuits. The operators contained in them are
counting operators. To realize some algorithm in the computer. one must
bring the computer memory to such a state after fulfillment of the next

156

counting operator that it fulfills the next counting operator or checks the
next condition. Additional operators which prepare the state of the computer
memory must be introduced for this. These additional operators are called
control operators. The second form of the algorithm circuitnflow sheet-is
called the logic circuit compiled of counting operators, control operators and
logic conditions which determine the order of operation of the computer since
the counting operators in all accessible initial data are fulfilled in the
order which the counting circuit requires."

Making an analogy between counting circuits and flow charts on the me hand
and our modern concepts on the other, one can say that the former are a rep-
resentation of algorithms in high-level language and the latter are represen-
tation in a low-level language.

The logic circuit apparatus became the first language in the world that made
it possible to talk about general programing procedures. The culmination of
these procedures was also named the operator method in programming. This is
a method in which the program compilation process is represented in the form
of a sequence of steps. each of which has a specific function. The input in-
formation for each stop is writing the algorithm to be programmed in one
language and the result is writing it in another language. The following
steps are always provided: 1) transition from some initial description of
the algorithm to its description in the form of a counting circuit, 2) tran-
sition from a counting circuit to a flow chart and 3) transition from a flow

chart to the program itself.

The appearance of the logic circuit apparatus made it possible to talk about
equivalent conversions of circuits and consequently to raise the question of
improving program quality. The equivalence of the counting circuits was de-
termined in this case by the requirement of the equality of functions imple-
mented by these circuits (i.e.. as functional equivalents in current termin-
ology). while the equivalence of flow charts was determined be the requirement
of the equality of a chain of counting operators to be carried out.

The operator method laid the basis of many programming hancbooks published
during the 19503. This indicates its enormous pedagogical value. But the

role of the operator is especially great in transformation of programing
from a craft to a science having its own range of problems.

Designation of programing as a science consists in reducing the laboriousness
of the programing process. The first specific tasks in this general path
were clearly formulated only with the appearance of the operator method.
These are primarily problems discussed directly by the operator method itself a
l) the problem of multilevel description of programing algorithms and de-
velopment of languages used at individual levels, 2) the problem of develop-
ing algorithms for transition from objects of one level to objects of another
level and 3) the problem of constructing optimization transformations of
algorithms of one or another level.

The standardization of programming procedures established in the operator
method was naturally aimed toward design of a programming routine, i.e., a

progra which will itself construct programs for solving different problems.
his problem was posed by A. A. Lyapunov in 1953 and determined the direction
of investigations in programing that has been actively developed up to the
present time.

A. A. Lyapunov assumed it was possible to begin design of a programming rou-
tine directly on the basis of logic circuit language. The first experiments
in design of a programing routine were made in 1954 at mo by graduate stu-
dents of A. A. Lyapunov. mese were alternate versions that had not been
preserved up to the present. Many programing routines' were subsequently
designed on the basis of logic circuit language and A. A. Lyapunov was con-
sulted in some of these developments.

_ The work in development of programing routines canprises an important step
in the history of Soviet programming, although the programs themselves did
not find broad application in programing practice. A significant reason for
this was the following circumstance: our computers of that time were equipped
only with digital input and required manual coding of the initial algorithm.

In [8] A. A. Lyapunov designated the program of further investigations in this
field; it briefly reduces to the following--intelligent classification of prob-
lems is required, languages are needed that are easily adaptable to these
classes of problem and a specialized programming routine (oriented toward
this language as the input language) should be developed on the basis of each
of them.

And indeed work in development of a programing routine, being interrupted
for some time, was restored after the first algorithmic languages oriented
toward descriptions of algorithms of one or another class were developed and
computers were equipped with symbolic input. It was restored in the form of
work on compilation of translators from algorithmic languages. The experience
acquired daring development of programing routines was fully utilized and it
is no accident that the first compilers of translators were the collectives
headed by former developers of programming routines.

The development or translator and investigation of the principles of their
development is the basic direction in modern programing. Its founder was
A. A. Lyaptmov.

Postulation of the problems that are the foundation of algaraic programming
theory belongs to A. A. Lyapunov. Its objects are consideration of algorithms

*In 1954 E. z. Lytbimskiy developed ”-1. One year later a collective consist-
ing of H. R. Shuts-Burs, E. z. Lyubimskiy, S. 8. Ramynin, V. s. Shtarkman,

B. s. Lukhovistkaya and I. B. Zadykhaylo developed the considerably more im-
proved PP-Z. In 1956 A. P. Yershov, V. II. Rurochkin, 1.. N. Korolev, L. D.
Panov and V. D. Podderyugin developed a programing program for the BESM com-
puter: in 1957 N. A. Krinitskiy, A. M. Bukhtiyarov, G. D. Prolov, I. V. Potte-
sin, L. V. Voytishek and A. A. Levine developed PP-s for the Strela cmnputer
and so on.

as algebraic objects constructed in some alphabet, formal methods of intro-
ducing the relation of equivalents in a set of circuits and searching for
algorithms for resolution of equivalents and designing a complete system of
equivalent circuit conversions.

From its first days, logic circuit language was used not only to describe
specific programming algorithms. A. A. Lyapunov suggests that a logic circuit
be considered as description of a class of programs. In this case the opera-
tors and logic conditions contained in it are interpreted as arbitrary struc-
tural displays. A specific program is obtained from a circuit if a specific
image is attached to each of its operators and logic condition--in other words,
the symbols of operators and logic conditions are interpreted in some manner.
Since some equivalence ratio is determined in a set of programs, it induces
the equivalence ratio in a set of circuits. A. A. Lyapunov posed the problem

of constructing an algorithm that recognizes the equivalence of flow charts
and that searches for a complete system of equivalent circuit transformations.

If the equivalence ratio is introduced between programs by the feature of the
equivalence of displays realized by the programs, then the circuit equivalence
introduced by this ratio achieves convenient and adequate algebraic interpre-
tation. in this case (and also for algebraic interpretation of the problem) I
the problems posed by A. A. Lyapunov were completely solved by Yu. I. Yanov
(1957) . The papers of Yu. I. Yanov are the first in algebraic programming
theory. This scientific direction is being developed actively and serious
theoretical and applied results have now been achieved in it.

A. A. Lyapunov paper "On Algebraic interpretation of Programming" played an
important role in development of programing and its theory [9] . It is de-
voted to formalization of the basic concepts of programing: programs, the
process of fulfilling it, functions, the implemented routine of the equivalence
ratio of programs and so on. This paper determined the approach to a develop-
ment of the concept apparatus of programming.

A. A. Lyapunov's operator method was the first major scientific result in
programming. An entire generation of programmers was reared on its basis.

It provided the soil for numerous investigations in programming. In program-
ming theory and practice, A. A. Lyapunov advanced those problems which de-
termined for many years the direction of research in this field. And there-
fore we link the establishment of programing in our country to the name of
A. A. Lyapunov.

Philosophical and methodological problems occupy a significant position in

A. A. Lyapunov's scientific activity during the last years of his life. A. A.
Lyapunov's concepts that were not published in his papers, but have been re-
tained in the memory of his students, about such problems as the fundamentals
of mathematics and the theory of algorithms. are interesting.

A. A. Lyapuncv did not confine himself to a single one of the concepts that
arose as a result of the third crisis of the foundations of mathematics,

assuming that one must in each case make use of the mathematical apparatus
and the terminology which are most convenient. For example, he did not feel

159

that constructive mathematics is any more competent than classical mathematics
(and vice versa) .

He suggested that the main designation of the theory of algorithm is not to
serve as the foundation of mathematics but felt that it is of greater inter-

est as an independent scientific discipline of interest and should be the
methodology of the analysis and synthesis of algorithm.

In papers on the sethodology of cybernetics and mathematics and on scientific
kno ledge in general [1. part 5], he investigates the role of mathematics and
cybernetics in mdsrn society, the problems of providing a mathematical basis
to science, the place of cybernetics anong other sciences, general problems of
the current state of scientific knowledge and classification of the sciences
and the relationships of different scientific fields. These papers are essen-
tially the result and journalization of his investigations and creative activ-
ity in different fields of science.

As a scientist. organizer of science and person, Aleksey Andreyevich is now a
model seem. to none.

Introduction

Modern society is characterized by intensive development of science and scientific
research methods, one of the most powerful of which is the method of modeling.
Hodeling is based on similarity theory, and models are constructed so that the
equations of the model and the equations of the object are similar, i.e., analogous.
The use of analogy in the form of the mathematical expression for physical pro-
cesses occurring in different objects with the processing occurring in electrical
and electronic circuits has provided the basis for the development of the electri-
cal modeling method.

Electrical modeling is a method for experimental investigation of physical pro-
cesses under conditions which have a precise mathematical formulation. Similarity
theory as applied to electrical analogs is used in order to extend the initial
data and the solutions obtained. In order to do this, the similarity criteria are
defined which establish the relationship between the analogous quantities in the
electrical models and the physical processes being investigated.

The functional capabilities of the electrical modeling method are expanded signif-
icantly by using the method of quasi-analogies, which is based on the principle

of equivalence between the objects of the equation and of the model in terms of the
results obtained. Similitude between the equations of the physical process and
of the electrical model is achieved in quasi-analog models when certain conditions,
called equivalence conditions, are satisfied [51. 56].

As modeling technique develops, the criteria by which the modeling devices are
divided with respect to the quantities with which they operate into continuous
(analog) and discrete (discrete) becomes increasingly conditional. In view of
various practical considerations it is sometimes more convenient to use discrete
codes to represent the modeled quantities, while analog representation may be
more convenient in other cases. It may be the case that the structure of the
connections between the modeled quantities is fully defined by the singularities
of the discrete model, while the modeled quantities themselves, being elements of
a discrete set, are not analogous to the modeled quantities, which are elements
of a continuous set. The correspondence between these is established according
to the principles of logical equivalence or class analogies. In one case the
original system of equations is solved by modeling of equations which are similar
bit by bit to the original equations in finite word length; in the other case, a
system of logical equations is modeled which is logically equivalent to the
assigned system in the sense of closeness of the results obtained. If the model-
ing is done in continuous time in both cases and the model is a digital automaton,
it is convenient to call the latter the modeling automaton. The problem of syn-
thesis in investigating such automate is urgent, since "life is moving to the
forefront of exploratory research the need for studying objects (automate) which
function in continuous time and which, strictly speaking, cannot be related def-
initely either to continuous dynamic systems or to discrete automate" [17].

The modeling devices which are in extensive use are not reversible. This means
that the external poles of the model are strictly divided into input and output.
The fact that the external poles are not equivalent limits the group of problems
which can be solved, and prevents the same model from being used to obtain a
solution to equations for different groups of variables.

Models in which the initial quantities can be assigned on any set of exrernal
poles and in which quantities satisfying the system of modeled equations can be
obtained on the remaining poles are called reversible. These models are needed
in constructing automatic control systems, and in designing objects when it is
necessary to be able to use the results of experimental investigations, which are
in the general case the solutions of certain systems of equations, to determine
the external effects to which the objects are subjected during the experiment,
i.e.. to solve a group of reversible problems.

The first publications on the theory of models having the property of reversibility
appeared in the late 1950s and early 1960s: this includes A.“. Lebedev's work [#3,
bk] on quasi-reversible models with artificial reversibility, is well as G.Ye.
Pukhov and B.A. Borkovskiy's work on reversible models [55, 58] and c.2h. Yuffler's

The entire set of models which have reversibility properties can be divided into
three groups. The first group is made up of reverse information models, i.e.,
models in which reverse cause-and—effect relationships are modeled. The reverse
information model of a process which develops over time follows various criteria,
usually probabilistic, based on experience or model learning, to find the set of
event circuits which lead to a known effect [68].

The second group includes reversible models with equivalent external poles. Infor-
mation may be assigned on each of these poles, depending upon the conditions of

the problem, and a result satisfying the required mathematical relationship can

be obtained [56, 55, 58]. There are reversible models with natural and artifi-
cial reversibility.

Models with natural reversibility are reversible models constructed using physical
principles of conservation, as well as models for which the mathematical notation
for the operating principle has the nature of the principle of conservation due

to a defined set of parameters of the modeling device.

Artificially reversible models which accommodate a set of individual models of
direct and inverse mathematical relationships in a defined manner are called
reversible models with multichannel structure. Symmetrical reversible models
are a special case of these. The external poles of these devices are equivalent
in the sense of assigning or obtaining information, and the device as a whole has
the property of symmetry. Hhen information is assigned on any group of poles,
the result of the modeling of the same mathematical operation is obtained on

the remaining poles. For example, a symmetrical reversible logical AND circuit
outputs the corresponding values of the logical AND function on the third pole
when information is assigned on either of the other two poles.

The broadest group is made up of artificially reversible models obtained using
balancing devices. These have the property of reversibility due to the use of
various tracking system circuits which act as balancing devices and due to con-
structing the external poles such that the input signals are capable of control-
ling the structure of the model. Depending upon the method by which the modeled
quantities are represented and the principle by which the balancing device is
constructed, it is convenient to divide these models into analog, logical, digi-
tal and hybrid.

In reversible analog models, the balancing device is a d.c. amplifier, which is
called a generating amplifier below since it generates a null potential voltage
level at its input over the corresponding feedback circuits when connected to

the modeling circuit. The role of the balancing device in logical reversible
models is played by logic circuits which execute mod 2 summation. Digital re-
versible models use digital tracking systems, while in hybrid models the infor—
mation can be assigned in either digital or analog form. Combining digital and
analog reversible modeling circuits into a unified modeling system in which the
individual parts are connected by reversible data converters makes it possible to

create hybrid reversible modeling systems.

Finally, the third group includes quasi-reversible models which model mathemati-
cal relationships which are the inverse of direct relationships by means of

167

switching operations which cause the structure of the model to change.
The present work investigates reversible models with balancing devices.
The book consists of five chapters.

Chapter 1 is devoted to general questions of the reversibility of models and pheno-
menon. It briefly presents information concerning the reversibility of physical
systems and mutuality principles, which are often identified with the reversibility
property when applied to electrical circuits; the principles behind the
construction of reversible models with naturalsnd artificial reversibility
reversibility are also examined.

Based on the general principles of synthesizing quasi-analog modeling devices,
chapter 2 presents methods for constructing reversible and quasi-reversible
models of linear and nonlinear algebraic and differential operators.

Chapter 3 is devoted to dynamic reversible models in which the required mathema-
tical relationships are modeled in a process of continuous switching of the
generating amplifier.

After a brief exposition of questions associated with the theory of point calcu-
lus, chapter 6 examines the construction principles of reversible point integrators
and the structures of hybrid systems based on them for solving differential equa-
tions with complex boundary conditions.

Chapter 5 is devoted to reversible modeling automate -- digital models in which
reversibility is attained by using digital tracking systems and special construc-
tion of the external poles. This chapter examines reversible models of elementary
logical functions, systems of logical equations, as well as symmetrical reversi-
ble logic circuits. This chapter concludes with an exposition of the construc-
tion principles of reversible hybrid systems with reversible data converters.

demy of Sciences, and Professor A.N. Lebedev, as well as senior scientific work-
ers 3.A. Borkovskiy and V.P. Romanstov, whose cooperation on a number of the
problems touched upon in the book were of undisputed help in finishing the work.

5.6. Hybrid Models

There is a great deal of attention to problems of hybridizing computing devices in
the scientific and technical literature. This interest is associated with the
need for creating computers which are economically more efficient, faster and

more accurate than existing computers. Many authors believe that it is possible
to construct machines which combine these features by combining different methods

of representing the information and principles for processing it. In order to
reduce the amount of hardware and increase economic efficiency while realizing
high speed and accuracy, it is possible to combine methods of representing the
information and processing it within each operating unit, or within the entire
computing system. Modeling systems which are built from such operational units
can be called hybrid modeling systems (HHS). We shall consider HMS in which the

168

digital section is executed in the form of modeling automate. The following
basic ways of constructing HHS are possible.

 

Figure 5.35

l. HHS using hybrid method of representing information and processing it at op-
erational unit level.

2. HHS which conbine operational units which work with information represented
in different forms.

The first construction nethod is based on representing the infatuation within

each operational unit of the computer in hybrid form. For steeple. in coarse
systems, the main part of each variable is represented in digital form, while the
rest of it is represented in analog. i.e., x - :4 + 2.. The operational unit

in such hybrid nodeling systems consists of two sections - digital and analog -
which are interconnected by carry circuits and a device which generates the sign
of the result. The operating principle of the digital and analog circuits is
identical - the result is obtained in the modeling process.

An adder which operates with information represented in hybrid forn consists of the
following units: the sign adder, which generates the sign of the result of the
operation; the digital parallel adder. which adds the digital parts of the input
terms; and the analog adder which adds the parts of the input signals which are
represented in analog form. These sunnator units operate in parallel; therefore.
the device outputs a signal when signals appear at the inputs after colpletion

of the transient processes in the circuit.

Most of the elements which are needed to construct the operational units which

operate with information represented in hybrid for- are familiar. Building HHS
from such operational units consists of connecting then in accordance with the

structural programming aethod which is characteristic for analog coapuring

equip-ent. In constructing the structural circuit to solve the problem, the
outputs of the sign units and digital and analog sections of one group of hybrid
modeling operational units are connected to the inputs of the sign, digital and
analog units of the other operational units respectively.

“hen the conditions for stable system operation. as well as the equivalence or
sinilarity conditions of the equations of the problem to be solved and the equa-
tions which are described by the hybrid model are satisfied, the corresponding
operational units will output the solution to the problems. The accuracy of the
solution is determined by the word length of the digital section of the opera-
tional units. and the time required to solve the problem in modeling non-inertial
objects described by finite equations will be cocparable to the decay tine of

the transient processes in the electronic circuits of the system.

By_cod>ining analog reversible Iodels and reversible modeling automate it is
possible to create reversible M. The reversible units which Operate with
information represented in different forms must be connected through reversible

data converters [62, 68].

Figure 5.36 shows the diagram of a reversible data converter. It consists of two
reversible analog inverters, an analog-digital converter and a digital-analog
converter. In order to assign information in digital form, it is represented in
paraphase code. A special construction of the circuits connected to the external
poles is used whose operating features were examined above. If a quantity 1* is
assigned, it is input to the reversible inverter, after which the analog-digital
converter converts it to a parallel digital m-bit code which is input to the
digital-analog converter through the logical inverter units. The digital-analog
converter outputs an analog quantity equal to -xA. This quantity is input to

the second analog reversible inverter and re-converted to its original form.

Hhen this is done, the quantity x” is output in digital code by the output poles
1, 1°. An analogous situation occurs if the quantity :9 is assigned in digital
form in parallel m-bit code. This is first converted to an analog quantity, then
the sign is reversed twice in the reversible analog inverters, converted to code
in the anelcg-digital converter and output at poles 1, 1°. The quantity -nA is

170

output at the pole which is cannon to both of the reversible inverters.

A reversible HMS can consist of a reversible analog model, a reversible nodeling
."tonaton, a reversible data converter and devices for inputting and outputting
information represented, respectively, in analog and digital form. An interesting
point is that each of these computing units is a nodeling unit, and a unified
hybrid modeling system can be built fron such units only if each of then is rever-
sible. -
