AU'IOMRD SYSTEM FOR WWI-LING WWICAL P1088388 IN PRINTED-CIRCUIT BOARD
PRODUCTION

Moscow PRIBORY I SISTER! UPRAVLENI‘IA in Russian No 3, Mar 82 p 5
{Article by Engineer I. P. Karushevl

['next] The Ryazan' Planning and technological Institute (m1) has developed the
technology of a mechanized process for producing printed-circuit boards, and the
associated mechanized equipment. We know from the literature' that this process
differs from those presently used to produce printed-circuit boards at the instru-

ment making sector's plants in that it includes a nuﬂaer of operations performed
on modular jet processing lines. the lines required for a given operation are

assembled out of unified modules. The technical level of the unified nodules
developed in recent years has risen significantly, making it possible to achieve a

60-80 percent level of mohanization and automation.

Analysis of the technological processes associated with printed-circuit board pro-
duction would show that its output variables, for example the quality of the
printed boards, exhibit a complex dependence upon the parameters of the techno-
logical processes. In this case the determined factors define the significance
and nature of changes in the mathematical expectation of a particular output
variable, while factors which cannot be controlled and cannot be monitored define
the significance andnature of random deviations of the latter from the mathematical

expectation.

Inasmuch as there exist many unrevealed statistical mtual relationships between
the parameters of tne same operation and between parameters of different operations,
and moreover because there are no series-produced sensors permitting measuremnt
of concentrations in multi-ingredient solutions, or controllable valves resistant
to chemicals, or automated Soviet production equipment, there are great difficul-

ties in achieving full automation of the technological processes. This is why
it would be expedient to automate individual steps of the production operations.

'me RPTI has developed and introduced the first generation of an ASU 'l'P [automated

sxstem for controlling technological processes] for printed-circuit board production.

Circuit Board Production,” PRIBORY I SISTBHY upmwunnva, No l, 1978.

It was created on the basis of the technological processes used in production of
printed-circuit boards by a combined positive method in which the circuit pattern

is applied photochemically. in terms of the type of production, these are referred
to as continuous-discrete technological processes. Four operations (four steps)
were selected for automation (in the first generation of the system): exposure,
development, removal of the photoresist and etching. These operations have been
studied the most deeply, and they yield relatively easily to automation. Para-
meters of the production process that can be monitored and controlled are: solution

temperature and level; solution pressure in the line's jet systems; concentration of
solution ingredients; operation time: number of boards processed.

Effective operation of the system can be achieved by applying a number of systems
engineering concepts. The complex of control algorithm includes special sub-

routines providing additional control over the system's preparation and preventing
output of false control commands to the working organs. The system has a bilevel

hierarchical structure (process control computer complex, local automated equip-
ment) making it possible to switch to autonomous or manual control of the lines and
units at any time.

The system's bilevel structure allows it to go on functioning when the equipment
experiences a partial breakdown, when the process control conputer complex experi-
ences random failures and when the operator makes mistakes--that is, it ensures

high viability for the system. When the upper level (the process control computer
complex) fails, the system's operation in autonomous or manual control becomes
less effective. However, the processes on the lines and units are not interrupted,
and they may be continued without ruining the products or causing mishap. During

the time of autonomous or manual control, the parts of the system that had broken
down could be repaired and placed back into operation.

The A50 T? for printed-circuit board production is based on the LIUS KMZlOl hard-
ware complex. The figure below shows a simplified structural diagram of the

system and its information pathways. The production equipment subjected to con-
trol includes: U898 exposure unit: A80 automated printed-circuit board development

line,- A81 automated photoresist removal line; A79 automated printed-circuit board
etching line; equipment automatically loading the lines with boards to be processed;

U908 etching solution preparation unit; U907 etching solution mixing unit; U906
etching solution purging unit.

The sensors and controls of the automated lines and units are connected to local
control consoles and, by way of a switchboard, to the 1042101 corplex‘s object linking
unit. The system's technical resources also include the following, not shown in

the figure: Automated line manual control consoles, automatic loading unit control
consoles and power supply boxes.

The system is intended to operate in two modes--systemic and autonomous. Moreover
the equipment can be operated in manual control mode . In systemic mode control is
exercised on the basis of the time required for each operation depending on solu-
tion concentration, with the temperature, level and pressure maintained at set
values. Operation time is set on the basis of an experimental characteristic de-
pending on the surface area to be processed within a fixed volume of solution.
Appropriately calculated control commands are fed continuously to the feed rate
adjusting block; changing the rotation rate of the at tomated line's conveyer, the
latter changes the operation time.

Boards to be processed are fed onto the automated line conveyers by the automatic
loading unit from general-purpose cassettes, from which they are ejected one at

a time. In systemic mode the automatic loading unit is controlled by the LIUS
hardware complex. When the paramters of the technological processes occurring

on the automated lines go beyond permissible limits, when mishaps arise or when

the process falls out of synchrony, board loading onto the conveyer is automatically
stopped. The problem of automating preparation of etching solution and its delivery
to the automated etching line was partially solved in the first generation of the
mu 79 for printed-circuit board production. Units U906-u908 were developed for
this job. When the solution concentration attains a minimum permissible value, the
102101 complex emits a comand to replace the solution. The U906 unit pumps the

solution from the production modtle into the U90? unit, and after the module is
rinsed out, fresh solution is fed into it from the 0908 unit.

Information on the progress of. the technological processes is concentrated at the
central console of the operator-process engineer in the form of light signals and
digital displays. his central console consists of a WKIl-3 unit from the 1012101

complex, somewhat modified. The printing unit periodically registers the technologi-
cal paramcters of all of the automated lines.

The organizational problems solved within this system include accounting for the
quantity of finished products in the automated portions of the operations and

preparation of information for the automated production control system.

In systemic mode, work is possible both with all automated lines and units simul-
taneously and with a part of them when some break down. In autonomous mode, the

required conveyor speed is set manually by the operator on the basis of a table.

The technological processes are monitored by way of light signals on local control
consoles.

me economic impact of producing the system is about 160,000 rubles.

In the next phase of the development of this ASU '1'? for printed-circuit board

production, the drilling and the chemical and galvanic copper-plating steps are
to be automated.

CBHA countries, promoted development of a new, functionally couplets, coupler

system of computer resources with develo; ed peripheral equipment and software (1).
The program foresees the order of creating and developing SH EVH UVKs.

The first-generation SH BVH Wits now being produced in large series use software
coupatible with that of former ASV'r-H UVKs which the former have replaced. Natur-
ally, this continuity will also be a feature of future SH 8W! models. The volume
of accmulated applications (user) software intended for more than 1,000 control
systems is about 700 million con-lands (3).

auracterized by high productivity (140,000-320,000 operations per second in rela—
tion to their principal operations), expanded memories (up to 120,000 words) and

a large nomenclature of peripheral units (We), object linking units (0803) and
adapters for 659 instruments, the first-generation models of SH BV'M UVKs (from
SH—l to Sid-4) are readily adaptable to the requirements of concrete users in the
most important areas of application of SN BVH UVKs (4-6), among which we include,
in addition to KU TPs, scientific research and experiments.

The efforts to create resources for automating scientific research and experiments
making use of a mnber of CS? measuring instruments make up one of the most

important state programs (1). hasuring and computer couplexes (IVKs) were created
in the 10th Five-Year Plan and are now being produced within the framework of this
program. These complexes have rightfully been isolated as an independent object
of development and industrial production (5). vas have a unique feature: use of
the most iaportant state standard digital interfaces compatible with international

standards, KAMAK and Max 625-1 for programed control of the work of measuring and
controlling instruments.

The conception, plan and program of efforts to create the second-generation SM BVM
(developed at the end of the 10th Five-Year Plan) are ailed at solving the following
most inportant problems having a direct bearing on joint use of all GSP resources:
satisfying the demand for and eliminating the scarcity of computer resources in the
principal areas of their use; raising the technical-economic indicators of computer
resources to the level of the best mdern computers, expanding their functional

possibilities and raising their flexibility and suitability for mass introduction
into the national economy: raising the effectiveness of conputer use; significantly

enlarging the nomenclature of the available models of UVKs, peripheral equipment
and software, with a consideration for their specialization within the hierarchy
of computer resources (6).

The plan for development of the second-generation SH BVH foresees development of
problem-oriented complexes (POKs) ensuring creation of highly effective automated
control systems in selected areas of use (5). In contrast to the situation typical
of standard and specialized Me, the basic applications software being developed
and supplied to POKs will make it possible for the user to solve the most important

problems with minimum reworking of the programs, which will significantly reduce
the labor and material resources required to create local automated system.

The objective of the integrated program is to develop the SM EVM in relation to

the following main directions (7) : Computer models of different classes and
purposes; peripheral equipment, to include auxiliary memories with higher capacity
and speed, and P08 based on new principles of operation; USOs consisting of func-
tional units taking the form of integrated microcircuits intended for a mnber of
applications (autonomous, dispersed and mixed); units for telemetric data processing

systems; software, including packages of application programs, for the largest
applications of the SM BVH; standard Me and Bike serving as the basis for concrete

user complexes, to include ones equipped with adapters for GSP equipment possessing
standard interfaces (8,9) .

All SM EVM models are being developed on the basis of large-scale integrated
microcircuits assembled into nicroprocessors. circuits exhibiting higher integra-
tion, 8- and 6-bit microprocessors, memories characterized by significant volume
and higher speed, and integrated microcircuits based on low-power 'l'l'Lsh technology.

The principal classes of second-generation SH KVH models being developed in our

country and their qualitative characteristics are shown in the table on the
following page.

In terms of "SOs, the program foresees a sharp increase in nomenclature, to include
0505 based on large-scale integrated circuits--operation amlifiers, comparators
and digital-analog converters.

In the area of softwarenthere are plans for significantl raising the level of
programmmg assooiated with systemic and application prob!

reliable territorially dispersed systems, local and dispersed timesharing informa-
tion systems and so on.

Development and production of a numer of standard multicomputer WK configurations
(to include two-computer) and a set of complexes with many general-purpose terminals
will create a basis for synthesizing user comlexes in the most important areas of
joint use of 534'an and GSP resources. Standard WKs and IVKs will serve as the
basis for synthesizing a large nunber of POKs of this class.

The plan for developing the SH svn calls for creating POKs which, together with

GS? resources. will provide for the needs of the areas that must be automated on
priority (5): Continuous and continuous-discrete technological processes, mainly
in rolling mill furnace shops and in control of the power-consuming steps of charge
smelting, and charge calculation: the shops of enterprises involved in discrete
production, and mainly control of groups of machine tools and conveyer system,

and coordination of control over the mechanical working section with control of

the warehouse transportation system; industrial testing systems, including automated
testing stands for technically complex articles (internal combustion engines,

mining product quality (for example measurement of microirregularity parameters
during quality control of surfaces of processed parts) , and of the composition and
properties of substances (in particular, problems associated with selecting high-
protein strains of cereal grains, operational control of the concentration of
different ingredients in physics, biology and medicine); medical services to the
public and the processing of instrumental examination data obtained from patients
in therapeutic institutions; scientific experiments and research (laboratory experi-
ments, automation of monitoring and measuremnts).

The principal research tasks associated with creating such Pats and IVKs are:
Introducing, into measuring and control subsystems, microprocessor resources which
would increase the proportion of data collection and preliminary processing equip-
ment and procedures that would make use of rigid reloadable programs; developing
efforts to create new resources and methods of metrological support to POKs and
improving existing resources and methods: introducing microprocessor subsystems
that would distribute control and data processing between the appropriate levels
of a pox; introducing a standard analog interface compatible with digital inter-
faces.

By completing the work required by the SM EVM program in the basic areas of joint
use of SM SW and esp resources, we will lay the basis for a transition to a higher
qualitative level in terms of the most important user parameters. his will ensure
a sharp shift in the level and effectiveness of solving different kinds of control
problems, and in the final analysis it will produce a siseable savings in labor,
energy and materials.

[Article by engineers P.A.Bondarenko, v. f'. Koshtoyev and B. K. Kulidzhanov]

Excerpt] Large-scale integrated microcircuits can be used to exchange information
between peripheral equipment and microcomputers created on the basis of series

K580 and K589 microprocessor units. Such microcircuits include the KSBOIKSS parallel
programmable interface (PR1) and the KSBOIKSl series progrannable interface (PSI).
'me Earner consists of three eight-bit universal linking buffers (ports). making

data exchange possible between a central processor and peripheral units: the

latter exchanges data with the peripheral units successively, bit by bit, and with
the central processor in series and in parallel, byte by byte. This article de-
scribes a microcomputer interface based on series K590 microprocessors and having

a minimum number of peripheral units—-an SP-3 papertape reader, a PL-BO punch
and a 'r-63 teleprinter.

1he interface linking the reader and the punch with the microcomputer is diagramed
in Figure 1 [figure not reproduced]. the microcomputer interacts by way of the
interface with the reader and punch both in program made via the P81 and in direct
memory access mode in the event that there are no programs recorded in the main
memory for exchange of data with the peripheral units. A special array counter is
foreseen in the interface for interaction with the microcomputer in direct memory

access mode. A number corresponding to the nunber of bytes being transmitted from
the counter or printed out by the punch is fed into this counter from the console.
Information is exchanged with the main circuit of the microcomputer in direct
memory access mode through buffer registers—type K589IR12 integrated microciruits
having terminals with three states.

INTERFACE OP DEF-3H PIM‘TBR WITH “RIM-2 DIGITAL «ROUTER
Moscow PRIBORY I SISTEHY UPRAVLBNIYA in Russian No 3, Mar 82 pp 32-34

[Article by Candidate of Technical Sciences V. Ya. Durnovtsev and engineers 1.. v.
Kulyasova, B. V. Brekhov and B. A. Andrianov]

[Excerpt] The Nairi-S, Nairi-z and Nairi-K small digital cosputers have achieved
universal recognition and broad use owing to the simplicity of their structure and
their programming, the convenience of their maintenance and the possibility for
their use by even nonprofessional pmgramers. However, they do have the signifi-
cant shortcoming that the speed at which results are outputted is low (up to 8-10
symbols per second). A nuaber of situations require a large volume of calculation
results which are then used to represent the solution graphically, and in some

tasks such as tabulating couplex functions, analyzing transient processes in dynamic
systems, solving ordinary differential equations and some others, graphs are the
sole convenient way of displaying the results.

If we ignore the rather primitive attempts made with the 'Nachertim“ operator,

series-produced Nairi digital couputers do not allow for graphical representation
of calculation results.

The couple): for graphical representation of. the calculation results of a digital
computer described in this article includes a UP-‘I digital-potential converter,

a DEF-3M two-coordinate recording plotter and a Nairi-2 comuter subjected to
insignificant modifications making it possible to connect these devices and to
ensure their joint operation. Gosputer calculation results represented by coordi-
nate points (31;, 912’ are converted in the UP-‘I unit into analog values, which

are used by the DEF-3M plotter to draw graphs taking the form of straight-line
segments.

The interface was develOped on the basis of the microprogram principle of con-
trolling all operations, realized in the Nairi-Z, which made it possible, after
introducing additional microoperations and a “Key“ Operator, to expand the
existing conmand '0" ("Access to Consul-254 wit") to the connand "Obrashcheniye'--
”Access to Graph Plotting Unit“ (see table [table not reproducedl).

[Excerpts] Multilevel information collection and processing systems and local
automated control systems with remote terminals are often designed with a unified
linking channel consisting of a small SM EV" (System of Small Couputers] IRPS inter
face (interface for radial connection of units equipped for successive information
transmission).‘ The 1895 controller described below can be used to synthesize

such systems based on the Elektzzonika-éo microcomputer.

To provide for successive transmission of information, Elektronika-60 microcomputers
are outfitted with a successive exchange device (UPO) , over which the controller
described here has a number of advantages. Owing to use of a universal synchronous-
asynchronous transceiver (USAPP), designed as a large-scale integrated circuit,

the KSSOIKSI, the controller's flexibility is greater and its functional possi-
bilities are broader: In particular, the rate of information transmission and
reception between the microcomputer and peripheral devices may be program-varied
within a range of 50-9,600 band: the number of bits and information

in the format of the transmitted code (5,6,7 or 8) and the number of "stop“ bits
(1,1.5 or 2) can be changed by means of program; parity (odd or even) transmission
can be controlled, overall dimensions are twice less than those of a UPO; reliability
is higher due to a smaller number of conponents.

A structural diagram of the RPS controller is shown in the accoqaanying figure
[figure not reproduced].

The microcomputer linking buffer, made from K589AP26, K559IP1P and K559IP2P coupo-
nents, provides for controller addressing, two-way data exchange between the con-
troller and the microcowuter channel, and reception and transmission of control
signals. The transceiver links the two-way data channel of the (USAPP) with a
multiplexer, and the linking buffer with the microcomuter. The direction of
transmission is determined by the control signal produced by the control decoder.
The transceiver is made out of K589M°lé couponents.

The communication buffer is designed for a peripheral unit connection circuit
not less than 500 meters long. This link consists of two current circuits (for
information reception and transmission) galvanically shared with the USAPP. The
communication buffer transnitter is a current generator consisting of two KT3618
transistors. The linking circuit is connected to its output. The receiver is
based on a K293LPlB optron switch. State ”1" in the circuits corresponds to a
current of 15-25 M, while state ”0" corresponds to .‘ current of 0-3 M.

The controller is powered by two sources: +5 volts (censured power not greater
than 1 A) and +12 volts (consumed power not more than 0.15 A), its overall dimen-

sions are 501135Xl2 m, and it is structurally cowatible with the Elektronika-éo
microcomputer.

The IRPS controller can be used in systems for successive information exchange
containing standard units such as the 15 WV-60/9600-003 UPO, contained within the

Blektronika-GO microcomputer outfit. and among the nodules of the SH—3 and 516-4
minicomputers, the Sill-6002 and Sta-8501.

PREFACE

Fourth-generation computer equipment is constructed on the basis of integrated
microcircuits (IS) of medium and large level of integration that contain from
tens to several thousand of the simplest logic elements. Both general-purpose
integrated circuits produced in large quantities by specialized enterprises
and designed for use in the most diverse cmputer equipment (EVA) and special-
purpose integrated circuits produced in small series by casputer equipment
manufacturers and designed for use in specific developments are used in this

equipment.

The need for special-purpose integrated circuits is determined by the special
requirements on their electric parameters, characteristics and designs: for
example. making specific fmctional conversions or processing information by
a special program (semipermanent storage devices), provision of increased ac-
curacy and stability (code-analog and analog-code converters) or increased
power level (secondary power sources and control devices). Moreover, the
required functional intonation conversions in special-purpose integrated
circuits can be made on the basis of modern advances of optoelectronics, mag-
neticrelectronics and cryoelectronics using original design-production
solutions.

With regard to the restricted use of special-purpose integrated circuits and
the rapidly changing nomenclature, organization of production of these micro-
circuits at specialized enterprises is unprofitablenthey are developed and
produced by computer equipment development enterprises. A leading role belongs
to computer equipment technician-designers (specialty 0648) in solution of this
problem. The curriculum I'Designs and calculation of microcircuits and micro-
components of computer equipment" is provided by the academic program for
training specialists in the field of integrated circuit design. According to
a typical program of this discipline (index (MDT-W907, 1976), the designs of
the elements and components of integrated circuits, methods of calculating
them and fundamentals of design and calculation of hybrid and semiconductor
integrated circuits are considered in the proposed textbook.

With regard to the noted tendency of wider use of special-purpose semiconduc-
tor integrated circuits and large integrated circuits in computer equipment,

the author devoted a sufficiently large amount of attention to problems of
design of semiconductor integrated circuits. however. detailed methods of
designing the active components of semiconductor integrated circuits are not
presented in the book since special-purpose integrated circuits and large in-
tegrated circuits are usually developed with respect to semiconductor struc-
tures formed by standard production processes. In this case the designer
mainly solves the topological problems since the electrophysical parameters
and geometric dimensions of the layers in the cross-section of the s-icon-
ductor structure are known beforehand. The given electric parameters of the
active and passive components are provided by correct selection of their top-
ology and the corresponding geometric dimensions of the semiconductor domains.

Moreover, only the characteristic features of using a computer in design of
microcircuits are considered in the textbodc since the ftmdamentals of auto-
mated arrangement of components, routing of the interconnections and quality
control of topology are studied in’ the preceding curricula: "Design automation.‘

I would like to note in conclusion that the term 'microcomponents of computer
equipment“ not usually employed for electronics is used in titling the academ-
ic discipline and accordingly the book. Hicrocomonents are understood here
as smpended microminiature active and passive electronic radio components
(transistors. resistors, capacitors. inductances and so on).

The author expresses gratitude to colleagues of the Chair of Design of Blee-
tronic Equipment, Taganrog Radio Engineering Institute, who assisted him in
preparation of the manuscript, and also to reviewers, candidates of technical
sciences B. I. Yermolyayev and Yu. D. Kobtsev for valuable consents that made
it possible to improve the quality of the manuscript.

'lhe integration exponent k, which is characterized by the nunber of elements
and components contained in it N: k - lgN . is introduced to evaluate the
complexity of the integrated circuit. An integrated microcircuit of first
degree of integration (181) contains up to 10 components, a circuit of second
degree of integration (182) contains more than 10 up to 100 components. a
circuit of third degree of integration (153) contains more than 100 up to
1,000 components, a circuit of fourth degree of integration contains more than
1,000 up to 10,000 components and a circuit of fifth degree of integration
contains more than 10,000 up to 100,000 components. Integrated circuits con-
taining more than 100 components on a crystal or more than 100 crystals with
low level of integration located on the sale substrate are called large inte-
grated microcircuits (BIS).

The structure of. the substrate material and its surface state have a signifi-
cant effect on the structure of grown thin films and the characteristics of
film elements. High surface roughness of the substrate reduces the reliabil—
ity of thin-film resistors and capacitors since nicroroughnesses reduce the
thickness of the resistive and dielectric films. A height of microroughnesses
of approximately 25 nm is permissible with film thickness of approximately
100 nm. Accordingly. mohining the substrate surface for thin-film sicrocir-
cuits should correspond to surface roughness 14. Thick films have a thickness

of 10-50 microns; therefore, the substrate for thick-film integrated circuits
can have microrouqhnesses up to 1-2 microns, which corresponds to surface
roughness of 8-10. The height of the microroughnesses should be 50-200 nm to
ensure good adhesion of the paste to the substrate.

The overall dimensions of substrates are standardized. Several plates of film
microcircuits are usually manufactured by the group method on a standard sub-
strate. Nonwaste division of a standard substrate into 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 or
more parts yields a normalized series of standard card dimensions. The stan-
dard dimensions recommended for use of cards are given in Table 2.2.1. Card
dimensions Nos 3-10 correspond to the fit locations of standard housings.
Cards with the remaining numbers are used in microassemblies. The substrate
thickness comprises 0.35-0.6 mm.

Types of housings. According to COST 17467-72 “Integrated microcircuits.
Housings," the housings of domestic microcircuits are divided into four types.
The basis of classification are the shape of the housing and the arrangement
of the leads with respect to the body (an article without leads) of the hous-
ing. The main shapes of housings and the arrangement of their leads are shown
in Figure 2.4.1: type 1 is a rectangular housing and the leads are arranged
perpendicular to the base within the body of the housing ta), type 2 is a
rectangular housing and the leads are arranged perpendicular to the base with-
in the body of the housing (b), type 3 is a round housing and the leads are

Figure 2.4.1. Mes of Hicrocircuit Housings

The leads of the housings are numbered. Il‘he numbers of the leads are placed
on the schematic diagram of the aicrocircuit and on the corresponding contact
surfaces of the card. Special marks are ads to determine the position of the
first lead on the housing: a recess on the lead. asymmetrical arrangement of
one of the leads, a notch or point on the housing surface and so on. The nun-
bering proceeds clockwise if one looks at the housing fruit the direction of
the leads.

The accuracy of reproducing the resistance of a semiconductor resistor is de-
termined by the following factors: the precision of manufacture of the
phototenplate and photoresistive mask, the precision of the etching process
in which the opening in the protective oxide layer with given length to width
ratio is formed and the precision of proportioning and distribution of the
impurity atoms during alloying of the semiconductor by diffusion or ion
implantation.

The effect of production operations on the accuracy of reproducing the re-
sistance and the ratio of the resistance of diffusion resistors is illustrated
by the data of Table 4.8.1. It is obvious from the data of the table that the
main error is introduced at the impurity diffusion stage since it is rather
difficult to control the amount of introduced impurity and the depth of

deposition of the p-n junction. The ratio of the resistance of two resistors
is reproduced with sufficiently high accuracy since the resistive layers are
formed simultaneously. This feature is used extensively in design of the cir-
cuitry of a nicrocircuit. Circuit developers attempt to perform it so that the
output parameter of the microcircuit is determined by the ratio of the resis-
tances of the diffusion resistors.

Rather precise control of the beam intensity and the dose of introduced ions
is possible with ion implantation. The resistance of the resistor formed by
the ion implanatation method can be reproduced with accuracy of not more than

Glass, metal-glass, cermet and plastic housings are used to seal the crystals
of semiconductor integrated circuits. The designs of flat housings 401.14-1
and 401.14—2 are shown in Figure 5.6.4. Housing 401.14-1 has a glass base
with 14 flat planar leads arranged along the long sides with spacing of 1.25
In. The metal cover of the housing is soldered to the metal-coated surface of
the base. Natal-glass housing 401.14-2 has a metal bottom of the base, which
permits a significant reduction of the thermal resistance of the housing (see
Figure 5.6.3). Plat cermet housings with 24 and 48 leads are used to seal the
crystals of large integrated circuits. Examples of the design of cermet hous-
ings are shown in Figure 5.6.5. The leads on the body of the housing are
formed by the thin-film method (melting the metal into the ceramic. Airtight-
ness of the housing in the regions of the leads is provided by the use of a
multilayer ceramic. The crystal of a large integrated circuit is soldered to
the metal base of the housing to reduce thermal resistance.

Rectangular plastic housings are used extensively in integrated circuits and
large integrated circuits of personal and stationary calculators operating
under normal conditions. no contact surfaces of the crystal in the design
of plastic hwsing 201.14-1 (Figure 5.6.6) are connected to the leads of the
housing by wire jumpers. Crystals with spider leads are used in automated
assewly. Plastic housings are characterized by low cost and the possibility
of automated manufacture. The disadvantages are the inadequate moisture re-
sistance, limited operating temperature range (-10 to +70°C) and rather high
thermal resistance (Ru x lOO'C/H). The latter circumstance limits the use
of plastic housings only in comparatively low-power integrated circuits and
large integrated circuits (P 3 250 mu).

Round metal-glass housings 301.8-2 and 301.12-1 have 8 or 12 pin-type leads.

The design of housing 301.8-2 (Figure 5.6.7) is characterized by a good seal

and protection of the crystal against electromagnetic effects. However, this
housing design does not permit good thermal contact with heat dissipation and
high configuration density of computer equipment units.

and methods for and special features of calculating the reliability, functional ac-
curacy and technological reproducibility of 8618's [large-scale hybrid integrated
circuit] and microassemblies. They explain the basic technological processes in-
volved in the production of 3615's and microassemblies and discuss systems and meth-
ods for automating the designing of 8615's and microassemblies and equipment based
on them, as well as methods for modeling and controlling the technological processes
involved in the production of 8615's and microassemblies.

This book is intended for VUZ students and specialists engaged in the design and
production of radioclcctronic and electronic computer equipment.

FOREHORD

The present period of development of radio equipment building is characterized by a
universal transition from equipment based on discrete elements to microelectronic
equipment (HER) based on integrated circuits (IS). In order to produce and develop

FOR OFIWCHQL.USIICHVLY
MBA, it is necessary to know the physics of operation. failure mechanisms and quali-
tative characteristic formation factors of MBA elements.

In high-quality MBA and vehicle-borne equipment with improved size and weight char-
acteristics, the basic design elements are 8615's and microassemblies based on

housingless, semiconducting 15's. The qualitative characteristics and reliability
of HEA are determined by the qualitative characteristics and reliability of the

BGIs's and microassemblies. Therefore. an engineer engaged in designing and produc-
ing MBA must known the technologcial design features of BGIs's and microassemblies
and their interrelationship with the functional parameters and master the methods
for calculating the quality characteristics of 18's, BGIS's and microassemblies and
the methods for their technological support and automated design and production.

This book is devoted to these questions. In it the following subjects are dis-
cussed:

the basic technological operations that form and determine the qualitative charac-
teristics of thin-film 3618's and an analysis of their technical capabilities;
methods for and features of the calculation of the reliability, functional accuracy,
technological reproducibility and other qualitative'characteristics of 3615’s and
microassembliesz

the state of and prospects for the automation of the designing, technological prepa-
ration for production and manufacturing of 8615's and microassemblies. as well as
controlling their quality during the production process.

The explanation of the material and the engineering calculation methods is illus-

trated with process diagrams, algorithm flowcharts and examples of designs and cal-
culations.

The book is intended to be used as a textbook for VUZ students in specialties 0705
and 0648, the design and production of REA [radioelectronic equipment] and EVA
[electronic computer equipment]. It can also be useful to REA designers and process
engineers specializing in the area of designing and producing microelectronic equip—
ment.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

Systems for the automated designing and technological preparation for production of
BOIS's are based on modern computer facilities, most frequently on uulticomputer

cempicxes with a centralized structure.

The central computer usually solves prob-

lems on the REA cell, subblock and block level, while the peripheral ones solve the
problems involved in the designing and technological preparation for production of

8615's and wiring boards.

since the makeup of a SAPR's [automated design system] determines, to some extent,
the other equipment in the system, let us first discuss the hardware (Figure 9.3).

computer over either computer channels or a telephone-telegraph channel. An example
of such a complex is the automated work site for radio engineers (Am-R) , which is
based on SH [International System of Small Computers] and Nairi-d-m computers.

The ARM-R is a graphic, dialog-type complex that is intended for the automation of

engineering, design and technological problems, as well as to support the designer's
operational interacuion with the SAPR.

The program compatibility, standardization of the equipment interaction and textual
and graphic information description structure. the presence of cor-Ion computer sys-
tems elements, magnetic disk and tape storage units, input-output equipment and the
significant computational and logic capabilities of the processor of the small com-
puter used in the ARM-R insure [43]:

the solution of an extensive circle of REA design problems related to the reception,
storage and reprocessing of information:

data output on punched tape, printers. graph plotters and graphic or character
(alphanumeric) displays:

information input in the ARM-R's menory from the central computer, the SAPR. punched
cards and tape, magnetic tape, the graphic information encoding unit and various
keyboards:

reading or retrieval of information on magnetic tapes and disks:

communication with the SAP's central computer via computer or telephone-telegraph
channels; '

conduct of a dialog designing mode, with access to programs in both the ARM-R's com-
puter and the SAPR's central computer.

The makeup of the ARM-R was determined on the basis of its functional purpose. as
well as the composition and volume of the problems to be solved. The ARM-R was put
together on the basis of series-produced hardware manufactured by domestic industry
or the countries in the socialist concord.

The makeup of all 3615 SAPR hardware can be divided into five groups:

data processing facilities (computers, magnetic disk (MD) and tape (ML) storage
units and communication equipment);

facilities for the input of textual and graphic information and information on ma-
chine carriers into the SAPR;

facilities for operational interaction between the 8615 and M53 [microassembly] de-
signer and the system.-

facilities for the output of information on machine carriers and the production of
design and engineering documents;

facilities for producing special equipment accessories (photographic originals and
copies).

Let us discuss in more detail the composition and basic characteristics of ARM-R
hardware based on a small type “-400 or SM series computer, so as to evaluate the
ARM-R's capability for solving the problems involved in the designing and technolo-
gical preparation for production of 3615's and MSB's.

ARM-R Data Processing Facilities. These include the process control computer com-
plex (UVK) , magnetic disk and tape information storage units, and devices for match-
ing the information exchange channels. Along with the standard input-output equip-
ment, the UVK contains a small M-400, SM-3 or SM-4 computer that is used as the

ARM-R's host processor, performs the functions of a graphic display processor, and
acts as the ARM-R's logic nucleus (controls the Aim-R‘s equipment, converts informa-
tion and provides comunication with the SAPR's central computer).

The complex of data processing equipment for an ARM-R based on an H—400 UVK includes
a memory expansion unit. The total volume of the ARM-R's memory is 48 Kbyte. 814-3
and Sta-4 UVK's have improved technical characteristics in comparison with the "-400.

The maximum number of addressable 16-bit words is 32 K for the SUI-3 and 128 K for
the SM-4.

Magnetic disk information storage units are used to store programs for the WK's
disk operating system (006), the Arm's DOS, the testing system, the real time sys-
tem, the package of applied SAPR programs, constants and the archives, and is de-
signed to operate with storage units of the mar-1370 type. The magnetic disk stor-
age unit has one constant and one replaceable disk. A magnetic tape storage unit
provides for the entry, storage and reproduction of information on standard magnetic

tape with an external reel diameter of 216 m. The entry and readout rate is about
4,000 lines/s.

In addition to this, the processing facilities include units for matching the infor-

mation exchange channels between the nm's and central computer's processors over
machine or telephone-telegraph channels.

Information Input Facilities. The Arm-R utilizes punched tape, punched card and
graphic information input (encoding) devices.

The punched tape and punched card input units are standard comwter peripheral gear,
so let us discuss only the special SAPR graphic intonation input units.

The complexity of the design docuaentation is explained by the presence of variegat-
ed conventional symbols defined by YeSKD [Unified System of Design Documentation]
and YeSTD [Unified System of Technological Documentation], the meaningful inter-
connectedness of the images in drawings, and the presence of arbitrarily arranged
symbols and texts. Manual entry in a computer of graphic information, which is done
with the help of special input languages, is distinguished by low productivity and
inadequate protection against human error. Therefore, automating the input process
is an urgent problem that is being solved by the creation of automatic and semi-
automatic equipment. Automatic graphic information input units convert the traces
of lines and symbols on paper, tracing cloth, photographic film or some other carri-
er into digital computer code. The various designs of automatic graphic input de-
vices can be divided, according to operating principle. into two basic types: scan-
ning and tracking. In scanning devices, the field of a drawing is reviewed line-by-
line with the help of scanning systems. Scanning systems are based on ELT's
(cathode-ray tube] or electromechanical drives. Tracking units “follow" the lines
of a drawing, predicting their possible continuation and searching for the nearest
points of a line if there is random drift.

Automatic graphic information input devices are used to enter relatively simple in-

formation in a computer: graphs produced on automatic recording devices. the out-
lines of flat parts. Therefore, they are still not used on a mass basis in REA and
MBA SAPR's.

l-‘OR OFT-101$. USE ONLY
tu-v-w -. fur the semiautomatic input of graphic information have been used more wide-
17 in recent years. This is explained by the possibility of identifying the ele-
nwmh; uf a drawing and synthesizing a complete image of an object with human parti-
cipation. A number of designs of semiautomatic devices for the input encoding of
graphic information (PAKGI) have been developed ind realized on the basis of differ-
ent physical phenomena. Connon to all PAKGI's is the principle of distribution of
functions between the operator and the machine. The operator analyzes the drawing.
picks out the elements that need encoding. and sets the device's working member at
certain points on the drawing, after which--at his signal--it automatically computes
the points' coordinates and converts them into a digital code. 'mus, a PAKGI is
used to automate one stage of the entry of a drawing into a computer (computation of
the coordinates of points in the drawing that have been designated by the operator).

One of the widely used graphic information input devices is the display. Despite a
nutter of positive qualities, graphic displays have shortcomings (low accuracy and
resolution, limited field (screen) size, low productivity, high cost).

PAKGI's and displays are not mutually exclusive, but supplement each other. In con-
nection with this, the distribution of functions between displays and PAKGI's de-
pends on the nature of the problems to be solved by the system. Most typical is the

gin of coordinates can be moved beyond the limits of the plotting board's working
field to a distance of up to 8,200 m and correlate the drawing being encoded to the
electrical grid with 0.1-, 1-, 2-, 2.5- and S-mm discreteness.

As a result of the ISM-709 PAKGI's operation, digital information is produced on

For the conduct of a dialog in symbol form between a designer and the SAPR, displays
based on cathode-ray tubes, with both symbol and function keyboards, are the most
efficient.

Figure 9.7 is a functional diagram of a graphic display. The use of ELT's in the
display requires the solution of the problems involved in controlling ray deflection
with the help of signals from the computer. In the computer the signals normally
appear in digital form, but since analog signals (such as voltage) are required to
control an BLT, a digital-to-analog code-to-voltage converter is used. Precise ob-
servance of the temporal relationships is necessary in order to control ELT's; this
is provided by the control and synchronization units. Modern ELT's have little
afterglow, so in order to obtain a stable, nonflickering image under normal work-
place illumination. an image regeneration frequency of 30-40 cycles per second is
required.

Different methods are used to form the image on the display screen: point, vector
and step—by~step modes or a mode utilizing straight line segments and short vectors
[45]. In the point mode, the image is formed from points on the screen that are
addressable separately and have coordinates that are given as x and y in the regis-
ters. Displays have ELT's with horizontal and vertical arrays ranging from 256 to
4,096 addressable points: for solving problems with the SAPR. displays with arrays
measuring 1.024 x 1.024 points or more are normally used.

In the point mode of a display for laying out some figure consisting (for example)
of 100 points. it is necessary to organize a computation cycle that repeats itself
100 times and consists of approximately the following sequence of operations: con-
firm that i > 100 or not; send the values of x1 and Yi into the display's registers;
illuminate point (x1.y£); increase i by 1. This sequence of operations--a program
in the commands of the specific display--wi11 contain 5-10 commands. In order to
execute such a program on, for example. a Yes 1020 computer (with an operating speed
of about 20.000 operations/s). it takes about 0.5.10'3 3, while execution of an en-
tire cycle requires about 0.05 s. since it is necessary to have regeneration (re-
peated extraction of information from the computer every 0.03 s), the maximum number
of reproducible points for the given computer must not be more than 100. In order
to obtain an image consisting of 1,000 points, it is necessary to have a computer
with a productivity rate of at least 300,000 operations/s (such as an H-400). From
this it is obvious that a point display is useful for images of simple figures and
sets of individual points.

In order to depict on a display's BLT diagrams and drawings consisting of a set of
lines, the vector mode is used. In this mode, Axi and Ayi give the displacements
along the corresponding axes from the previous point depicted on the screen. The
basic advantage of the vector mode is the smaller 020 [operational memory] capacity
and the possibility of producing a quite complex image on the screen.

The substantial savings in memory in the vector mode as opposed to the point mode
can be demonstrated with a simple example. In order to store information about the
framework of a sketch drawn around the working field (1,000 x 1,000 discrete points
of the array) in the point mode, it is necessary to store 4 x 1.000 point coordinate
values; in the case of the vector mode. it is sufficient to store the coordinates of
the initial point and the values of four increments along each of the x and y axes.

As a rule. displays operating on the vector generation principle utilize several op-
erating modes. The straight-line-segment (vector) mode is used to produce long
lines. When the image contains many curved lines, the short-vector mode is used.

In this mode, in order to record AX and A! it is sufficient to use 4 bits instead of

FOR‘OFFKgfi.USE‘0NLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

the 8-10 bits required in the straight-line-segment mode. This makes it possible to
reduce the memory capacity even further. -
Displays can usually function in different modes, and the capability of changing
from one mode to another is provided in order to insure optimum reproduction of dif-
ferent parts of an image. This can be done by various methods. One of them is the
designation of the appropriate mode parameter in the special commands of the program
controlling the functioning of the display.

The designer's work with a 8615 SAPR involves constant participation in the design
process, correction of the decisions made by the computer. modification of the ini-
tial conditions and, finally, active intervention in the process of the solution of
problems that cannot be completely formalized. Thus, the designer needs both hard-
ware and software that give him the capability to enter the necessary information in
the computer on an operational basis.

A SAPR usually has as part of its linguistic capability certain graphic languages,
while the operators can have a line-by-line entry capability that makes it possible
to enter geometric information from such operational interaction devices as electric
typewriters, teletypes, or the symbol and function keyboards of the displays. Dur-
ing the process of designing a 8615, it is most convenient to conduct a dialog on
the level of geometric images. where the designer has the ability to modify some

Let us discuss the light pen used in the
Soviet-made YeS7064 and BPS-400 displays.
Figure 9.8 is a block diagram of the light
pen. If a point or line is in the pen's
field of view, an impulse is generated in
the photomultiplier every time the given
element of the image is regenerated. This
impulse is formed and transmitted to the
display's control unit. The output impulse
appears simultaneously with the image of
the element on the screen. This makes it
possible to determine the specific indicat-
ed element of the image.

Let us examine the technical characterist-
ics and capabilities of the AxH-R's symbol
and graphic displays.

The "Videoton-Jdo" symbol display in the
ARM-R is used as a systems console for the
reception of control information, such as
a directive from the 8615 and M83 develop-
er, and the depiction of messages, as well

to 80 symbols per line. The display's operating modes are as follows: autonomous,
operation with the computer, information transmission from the buffer memory into
the computer and parallel printing on a typewriter of the buffer memory's contents.
The display has the following text-editing capabilities: clearing of the image on
the screen, setting of a tag in the first position of the first line, movement of a
tag in four directions, tabulation, replacement, insertion, deletion of a character,
insertion and deletion of a line, memory protection, underlining. raising of a frame
one line upward and replacement of the last line.

The RFC-400 graphic display in the ARM-R is used to enter, depict and edit graphic
and symbolic information on an BLT screen. The display utilizes a channel that
gives direct access to the computer's memory in order to register an image on the
screen. It provides for the depiction of information in the following modes:
plotting of symbols:

plotting of long vectors, star vector points and right angles with absolute and rel-
ative assignment of coordinates;

plotting of short vectors with relative assignment of coordinates:

plotting of graphs with automatic increments along the x and y axes;

marking arbitrary positions with any symbol. -

Images with the following parameters can be depicted on the ape—400's screen: image
size--240 x 240 mm; number of addressable points--l,024 x 1,024; number of line mod-
ulation levels--8; types of lines--4 (continuous, dotted, dash, and dot and dash).

The graphic display provides for the entry of information in the computer by means
of symbol and function keyboards and a light pen that has resolution no worse than
seven units of the array.

The ARM-R complex contains the following documentation facilities: an alphanumeric
printer, a plotter and a microfilming unit.

The experience gained in automating technological design work shows that even a
small amount of manual intervention in the drawing up of technical documents causes
their quality to deteriorate, so it is not advisable to use a SAPR that does not
provide automatic registration of the design process's results in the form of docu-
ments acceptable to the archive services of enterprises.

An alphanumeric printer (ATsPU) is used for the output of textual documentation
(specifications. tables of coordinates and so on). The ARM-R has an ATsPU that fea-
tures sequential printing with a mosaic set of symbols. Each symbol is formed by a
point—type mosaic matrix of 7 x 7 elements. The printing is done on perforated pa-
per up to 420 mm wide, with up to 4 copies. The maximum printing rate is 180 sym-
bols per second.

Plotters controlled by the computer or perforated or magnetic tape are used for the
production of graphic information (graphs and diagrams, functional and electrical
diagrams, design and engineering drawings) in a 8618 SAPR. Plotters are semi-
automatic electromechanical drawing devices that consist of a recording unit (Figure
9.9) that reproduces an image on some carrier or another (paper, photographic film
and so on), a unit that controls the plotting process, and a unit for the entry and
conversion of the input information.

The functioning of plotters is based on the
principle of converting input commands into
proportional movements of a writing unit.
The writing assembly is put into motion by
step electric motors (or direct-current
electric motors) through mechanisms for
converting rotary motion into progressive
motion. Depending on the form of the docu-
mentation being produced. the following
types of writing devices are used: pens.
rapidografy [translation unknown], light or
laser recording units or a precision en-
graving unit and so on. Plotters are
equipped with several (from one to six)
writing devices that are filled with dif-
ferent inks and draw lines of varying

As far as their design is concerned, plotters are either of the plotting board or
the drum type. Drum plotters are used for the operational output of information on
paper from a roll. Plotting-board plotters are more accurate than the drum types,
and are used to produce drawings and photographic templates.

The specifications of several types of plotters are presented in Appendix 1.

Plotters have systems of control commands that are formulated in accordance with
their capabilities and purpose. The system of commands for the AP-7252 plotter that
is part of the ARM-R's hardware complex is presented in Table 9.3. It is easy to
understand the rules for encoding a graphic image by examining an example of the
control program for drawing the figure shown in Figure 9.10. When operating in the
increment mode, the segment that is being drawn or the transition (with the writing
device lifted from the carrier) is a number of steps or half-steps in 16th form.
The control program consists of a heading, data and a graph completion indicator.
The heading consists of the commands that determine the plotter's operating mode.
The data consist of a sequence of increments in the coordinates of points in the
graph that give the magnitude and direction of movement of the writing device. The
commands are given as two bytes. The first byte contains command indicator 23,

trieve needed information, and reducing the mass, volume and-~consequently--cost of
the documents. The solution of all these problems is possible because of micro-

miniaturization of documents with complete preservation of their special graphic
features.

Photographic films in different formats are used as nicrocarriers. Hicrocarriers
are classified as continuous (microfilm) and discrete (microcards). Microfilm is

normally used for the archival storage of documents and the creation of an insurance
stock of documents.

Discrete microcarricrs are used to create flexible information systems in ASUP's and
SAPR's. As a rule, a discrete microcarrier is a card made of photographic film on
either a paper or a plastic base in combination with the film. The most widely used
microcards measure 105 x 148 um and are called microfiches. A microfiche has a vis-
ually readable heading, and when 20-fold reduction is used, 72 pages of text can be
placed on it. In connection with this, a reduction in the volume of the printed
unit by a factor of 70-75 can be achieved, which makes it possible to create themat-
ic card libraries and archives of typical BGIS SAPR technological design solutions
that contain a great deal of information.

For the production of special technological equipment, in addition to the ARM-R
equipment facilities, BGIS SAPR's and AS'rPP's [automated system for the technologi-
cal preparation of production] also include devices such as a koordinatograf [trans-
lation unknown] and a microphotocomposition unit.

In order to produce the originals of 8615 phototemplates, program-controlled
koordinatografy are widely used at the present time. They consist of a drawing

table, a device for information input from punched tape. and a control unit. The
basic technical parameters characterizing a koordinatograf are its speed and drawing
accuracy. These parameters are closely interrelated: increasing the drawing speed
leads to a lowering of accuracy and vice versa. The type of koordinatograf chosen
depends on the required accuracy in the production of the phototemplate originals.
Modern program-controlled koordinatografy have a drawing accuracy of 20-150 um at
drawing speeds of 2.5-25 m/min.

One widely used program-controlled koordinatograf is the EM-703 [161, which combines
high productivity (up to 5.5 m/min) with high accuracy (:50 um) and a large field
for movement of the working tool (1,200 x 1,200 mm), which has a linear-circular in-
terpolator that makes it possible to cut out both rectangular and curvilinear out-
lines. This koordinatograf contains a high-speed tracking drive for moving the car-
riages that is based on direct-current motors. as well as a system for continuous.
automatic orientation of the tool's cutting edge in the direction of the cut. The
presence of a special device makes it possible to use the koordinatograf to draw on
photosensitive material with a light beam during the designing of Is and 8615 wiring
cards. The coordinate table insures high accuracy of the movements over the entire

working field because of its rigid design and the presence of photoelectric sensors
and mechanisms for the correction of screw errors.

The EM-549 microphotocomposition unit has a working field of 140 x ldOImn, with po-

0.30-30 mm. The unit's productivity is 2,400 exposures per hour. The EH-549 micro-
photocomposition unit utilizes a coordinate table on an air cushion. while movement
along the axes is accomplished with the help of a motor with a developed rotor. The
unit's large working field makes it possible to use it in the production of high-
quality thin-film BGIS's. Two working modes (photocomposition and scanning) make it
possible to use it not only to generate phototemplates. but also as a photorepeater.
Its broad scaling range (2-10) makes it a general-purpose device.

Specific systems for automating the design and production preparation processes are
put together on the basis of SAPR hardware. The hardware of SAPR's for different
purposes are, as a rule, identical in functional makeup. They differ in the charac—
teristics of the individual devices (operating speed of the computer, magnetic disk
memory capacity, accuracy and drawing speed of the plotter, printing speed for tex-
tual documents and so forth). The software is basically individualistic and is de-
termined by the specialization. purpose and quality of the SAPR and the technologi-
cal preparation for the production of 8615's.

SECTION 9.4. METHODS AND AIGORITHHS FOR AUTOMATED DESIGNING OP BGIS'S AND HICROP
ASSEMBLIES

TWO methods-—automatic and interactive--have been developed in the process of auto-
mating the designing of 8615's.

The automatic design method's essence is that synthesis of the design is carried out
only by the SAPR's facilities, according to a certain algorithm, while the designer
gives the initial data, sets off the design process, and evaluates and approves the
decision that is produced.

In the interactive method of design, there is interaction between the designer and
the SAPR facilities in the synthesis of the design. It is based on that division of
functions between them that makes it possible to use the creative qualities of man
and the computational power of computers to solve a formulated problem in the best
combination and as efficiently as possible.

In the automatic synthesis of a 8618 design, the design process is divided into sev-
eral stages because of the complexity of the solution of the problem as a whole and
the lack of general, effective optimization criteria. The design process is usually
divided into the following stages: layout of the 8615, calculation of the pellicu-
Jar elements, placement of the pellicular elements and discrete components on the
substrate. and layout of connections. When the design process is automated, each
stage has its own specialized algorithms and criteria. Communication between the
stages is realized through transformable computer models of the 3615 and special
criteria. The special criteria of the individual stages allow for the special fea-
tures of the subsequent design stages; for instance, during 3615 layout the number
of external leads is minimized, thus reducing the number and length of connections
between the 8615's. In the placement stage, using the criterion of minimum connec-
tion length, the total length of the connections is reduced as they are being laid
out on the 5615 substrate.

BGIS layout differs little from the layout of cells on printed-circuit cards, and
the same algorithms and criteria are used for the solution of these problems [46].

6
FOR OFFICfAL USE ONLY
Layout algorithms can be categorized as sequential, parallel-sequential and itera-
tive. In sequential algorithms. the layout process is realized sequentially, with
one of the design elements being added to the next H58 in each stage. In parallel-
sequential algorithms. some initial set of groups of elements is first singled out
and then distributed by assemblies, with due consideration for the layout criteria
and limitations. Sequential and parallel-sequential algorithms are used to create
the elementary layout variant for the given limitations on the number of elements
and leads on the "SB substrate.

Iterative layout algorithms are used to improve some initial layout variant in ac-

cordance with an adopted criterion. The basic optimization criteria are a minimum

number of 8618's and a ndnimum number of interassembly connections, while the limi-
tations are on the number of elements in the 8615's and external leads on the sub-

strate.

During the stage of placement of pellicular elements and discrete components on the
8615 substrate, their optimum spatial positioning on the substrate is determined.

A frequently used placement optimization criterion is the criterion of minimum total
length of the connections.

Depending on the structural features of a 8615. it is possible to use criteria that
minimize the number of connection intersections or layers of connections on the sub-
strate.

Placement problems can be divided into two types: placement of structurally mono-
typical components modeled on the substrate by points in previously given coordi-
nates, and placement of heterotypical pellicular elements and discrete components,
having a great variation in geometrical dimensions, on a continuous model of the
substrate without fixing their positions. Problems of the first type are typical
for digital devices. There are several types of algorithms for the solution of
these problems [46):

placement algorithms that use mathematical methods for solving function problems.
For placement modeled by a linear function problem, a Hungarian algorithm is used,
while for placement modeled by a quadratic function problem, the method of branches
and boundaries is used;

structural placement algorithms utilizing a sequential or parallel-sequential pro-
cess for the arrangement of components at positions given by coordinates create a
placement that can be an initial one for subsequent optimization according to a cer-
tain criterion;

in iterative algorithms there is repositioning of the components (or groups of them)
after the initial placement is produced by one of the structural algorithms. Itera—
tive algorithms require substantial expenditures of computer time and are used to
obtain a final solution.

The following recommendations on the use of placement algorithms can be made for di-
gital BGIS's. When there are limited computer time resources, relatively fast
structural algorithms for initial placement should be used. Among them, the simp-
lest ones from the realization viewpoint are algorithms for placement based on com-
pendency. For relatively small problem dimensionalities, these algorithms can also
he used to determine the final placement.

In order to obtain more accurate results, it is advisable to combine a fast initial
algorithm with an improving iterative one. Practice shows that this gives better

57

than when the initial positioning is obtained by some method that is sore or less
random.

Ammg the iterative algorithms, the most effective methods are based on paired re-
arrangements of elements in truncated neighborhoods of interrelated elements, which

makes it possible to reduce the time substantially while maintaining the same level
of accuracy in the result.

Problems of the second type are typical of digital-to-analog and analog devices.
which have a greater (by factors of tens to hundreds) variety of geometrical dimen-
sions of elements and components. These problems are frequently solved by the use
of interactive methods for arranging elements and components on the substrate with
the help of operational interaction facilities.

In Section 9.2 it was shown that modern SAPR hardware consists of devices that ex-
pand SAPR and designer capabilities significantly. For operational interaction of
the designer with the system (that is, the conduct of a dialog) . symbol and graphic
displays are used; for input of graphic information into the system--PAKGI graphic
information encoders; for the production of documentation and original photographs
of the layers—-plotters, microfilming units. koordinatografy and microphoto-
composition devices.

The presence of these special facilities, couputers of the SH series, the m's disk
operating system and a package of applied programs providing a mode where the de-
signer can conduct a dialog with the system, made it possible to create methods and
algorittuns for synthesizing the designs of 3618's and 1488's.

since the complex of 8618 SAPR hardware contains a graphic display and a package of
applied graphic programs, it is possible to create an impression of universality of
these operational interaction facilities for the interactive solution of the indi-
cated problems when designing 8618's. In reality, the spa-400 graphic display has a
screen measuring 240 x 240 mm, while the size of the light beam on the display's
screen is focused to a diameter of 0.3-0.5 m. Thus. one or two lines per milli-
meter can be distinguished on the display's screen. In order to represent on the
display's screen fully distinguishable elements of 3615 and M53 topology having a
minimum size of several tens of microns, it is necessary to represent the topology
with a magnification scale of 20:1, 40:1, or even more. Prom this it is obvious
that an M88 substrate measuring 24 x 30 m can be represented on such a scale only
in the form of separate fragments comprising one-sixth or less of the area covered
by the substrate. Therefore, in the face of such great fragmentation. dialog de-
signing of 3615's consisting of tens and hundreds of elements and components cannot
be sufficiently optimum because of the "nonreviewability‘ of the plan on the dis-
play's screen. The interactive arrangement method makes it possible to find the
first acceptable solution, since the optimization inherent in multivariant planning
is made more difficult. Besides this, the interactive method is more labor-
intensive and requires considerable amounts of time for the designer to interact
with the SAPR.

CHAPTER 11. AUTMTING CONTROL OF THE TECHNOMXEICAL PROCESSES INVOLVED IN 8615 AND
HSB PRCDUCTIGJ

Automating the production of 3615's encompasses a broad circle of problems, ranging
from automating the design process and the technological preparation for production

8
F0! 01-713“. USE ONLY
to automating the direct control of the technological operations and processes and
product ion sections as a whole. The improvement of the production process on the
basis of automation of the control of technological processes serves as a means for

increasing the productivity of labor, the quality of the articles produced and the
profitability of production.

At the present time most systems for the automated control of technological process-
es (ASU'I'P) involved in the production of microelectronic equipment are based on con-
trol computers. Hodern facilities for the automatic collection and processing of
information make it possible to solve the problems involved in automating the con-
trol of technological processes and obtain results that increase the productivity of

labor. the quality of the output and production efficiency, which were impossible to
achieve with other control facilities and methods.

The introduction of ASU’I‘P's makes it possible to do the following [13] :
realize a process with maximum productivity by automatically allowing for deviations
(drift) occurring in the technological parameters and the properties of the raw ma-

terials and semifinished goods, as well as changes in environmental parameters. op-
erator error and so on;

control a technological process by constantly allowing for the dynamics of the plan-
actuality relationship for the list of products being manufactured (rated values,

classes, accuracy and quality groups) by timely resetting of the technological
equipment's modes, redistribution of the work among monotypical equipment and so on;
realize automatic control, according to an optimum algorithm, under conditions that
are harmful or dangerous for human life.

It is important that the introduction of an ASUTP in a complex with facilities for
the mechanization of manual labor (industrial robots) makes it possible to use labor
resources efficiently and solve the problem of the deficit of qualified and un-
qualified personnel. In addition, the introduction of an ASU'rP produces (in princi-
ple) not only a direct economic (or socioeconomic) effect, but also makes it possi-
ble to obtain a large secondary effect. since it requires an improvement in the
overall level of technology, organizational orderliness of the production process,

and production efficiency.

All of this shows how essential the introduction of control computers in technologi-
cal production processes is for scientific and technical progress in radio equipment
construction.

11.1. STRUCTURE AND CMPOSITIONOFASUTP'S FOR THE PRODUCTIW 0? 3615's AND HSB'S

At the present time, integrated automation of technological processes on the basis
of a systems analysis approach is widely used; this means not the development of an
ASUTP for a given technological process, but technological process-ASUTP systems
[2].

The concept 'technological process" as an object of control includes, in particular.
the technological equipment, with the exception of sensors and actuating members
that are structural elements of the equipment but are actually part of the MUTP
hardware. In the following explication, therefore, control of a technological pro-
cess means control of the technological equipment's operating modes.

IO“ U?!“ IAI. (mt. UNI]

Henceforth, the term ”controlled technological process” will be understood to mean a
process for which the monitorable input effects (controlling, controlled) have been
determined, the deterministic or probability relationships between the input effects
and the output parameters of the article being produced have been established, and
methods for the automatic measurement of input effects and output parameters and
methods for controlling the process have been developed [2]. Thus, a controlled
technological process is one that, in principle, has been prepared for the introduc-
tion of an ASUTP; that is, for the creation of a technological process-ASUTP system.

Figure 11.1 is a generalized diagram of a technological process-ASUTP system. The
ASUTP in this system must predict, on the basis of an analysis of the measured val-
ues, the path of the process and realize that plan of controlling effects such that,
at a certain moment of time, the state of the process corresponds to some value of
the generalized process quality criterion that is close to optimum. As is obvious
from Figure 11.1, in addition to the control computer the ASUTP contains a complex

of information input-output devices (UVVI), actuating members and sensors that are
connected, on the one hand, to the computer through the UVVI and, on the other, to

thv controlled object. In a special case, measurement of the technological parame-
ters and control of the actuating members can be carried out through the operator

(dash lines in Figure 11.1).

The control functions are realized groundlessly, automatically, or with the partici-
pation of man in individual (or all) circuits. At the present stage, for all

FOR OFFICléﬁ. USE ONLY
practical purposes, primarily in preparatory, monitoring and assembly operations,
without the participation of man it is extremely difficult to realize control of
technological processes. so--as a rule-—an ASUTP also contains different devices for
communicating with operators (signal panels, mnemonics, displays, manual information
input and output consoles).

Among other production processes, the production of 8615's and HSB's is distin-
guished by the multiplicity of the technological processes, which differ in the na-
ture of the procedures (discrete, continuous, continuous-discrete), the physical es-
sence (vacuum, electrochemical, thermochemical and so forth), and the organizational
indicator (group or individual processing).

An analysis of the different technological processes and operations involved in the
production of 3615's and MSB's and an investigation of technological process-A501?
systems make it possible to formulate the characteristic features of processes as
objects of control:

substantial dependence of the results of a subsequent operation in a single techno-
logical process on the preceding one;

the diversity of the raw materials and relative instability of their properties:

the presence of temporally changing uncontrollable and even unmonitorable effects:

a tendence toward changing over to highly productive, mechanized realization of the
process (complexly mechanized technological lines), which practically eliminates the
possibility of manual control of the process, and allowing for the effect of dis-
turbing (controllable and uncontrollable) effects:

the presence of a large number of operations in mass production that were previously
done manually (monitoring, assembly, installation and others).

For different technological and production processes (spraying, painting, vzhiganiye
[translation unknown] and others), these factors are not of equal weight as far as
their effect on the quality of finished articles is concerned, although it is essen-
tial that in the production of practically any 8615 or HSB, the percentage of output
of serviceable articles is considerably less than 100 percent.

A no less important factor (specific for the electronics and radio industries) that
reduces production efficiency is the continuously changing portfolio of orders when
there is an extensive goods list of rated-value types and classification groups of

articles being produced. Using old technology and production control methods, the

timely and complete satisfaction of a request is an almost unsolvable problem.

These special features in the production of 3615's and HSB's determined the objec-
tive necessity of introducing automated control systems of both separate determining
technological Operations and as technology and production as a whole.

Modern hSUTP‘s are constructed on the basis of control computers that receive infor-
mation about the course of a technological process, process the information in ac-
cordance with the control algorithm that is entered in the memory in the form of a
package of programs, and transmits regulating actions to the actuating members or
advises the operating personnel through information display facilities.

In practice it is important to know what functions an ASUTP can perform relative to

a specific technological process and what are the sources of the economic effect
achieved by introducing the system, with due consideration for the functions being

performed. A certain degree of clarity in this question is made possible by the
classification of ASUTP's by functional-algorithmic features (Table 11.1) proposed
in [15] . Let us examine in more detail the functions of ASU'I'P's on the basis of
this classification. It is necessary to allow for the fact that the functions per-
formed by the systems in different classifications can overlap in a number of cases.

The first class includes ASUTP's with the simplest control algorithms; in other
words, there is a completely controlled technological process that was previously

under the control of an operator. The basic function of the central processor of
such ASU'I'P's is to execute control programs with automatic time distribution. The

control algorithm is an established sequence of logical operations with conditional
or unconditional transitions from one operation to another.

Systems of the first clsss include, in particular, direct multichannel digital regu-
lation systems or systems for the direct digital control of equipment, such as a
mi crophotocomposition unit .

The introduction of such automated systems makes it possible to:

eliminate incorrect human actions;

use, for control purposes, information in volumes that exceed considerably the
knowledge of a single operator:

operationally and accurately change the control program in accordance with a change
in the technological process's parameters;

increase equipment productivity as the result of eliminating manual control opera-
tions;

realize logic-program control of those operations and processes that man cannot con-
trol accurately and on a timely basis because of his relatively slow reaction to a
change in the course of the process.

The block diagram of an automated system
for the logic-program control of a single
technological operation is shown in Figure

The second class includes ASUTP's that, on the basis of a deterministic or statisti-
cal model of a process (see Section 10.2) entered in the computer's memory, solve
the problems involved in optimizing the process for the purpose of satisfying some

quality indicator. As has already been mentioned. for most technological processes
related to the production of 8615‘s and MSB's, there is a typical dependence oF the
results of subsequent technological processes on preceding ones, along with the
presence of a significant number of uncontrollable and unmonitorable factors (in-
stability of the properties of the raw materials being sprayed on, the effect of en-
vironmental factors and so on): that is. any process has stochastic (having the

nature of regular randomess) and purely random (noncalculable) components. Under
:mch conditions an operator cannot conduct a technological process in a mode that is
close to optimum, and in a number of cases this problem can be solved only by a con-

trol computer.

The basic function of the computer in an automated optimum control system is to per-
form, on the basis of measured values of the process's parameters and accepted math-
ematical methods (linear programing. regression and correlation analysis and oth-
ers) , a greater (in comparison with logic-program control) number of computations
and to use the results of these computations to work out the controlling actions
(advice to the operator). The design of ASUTP's provides for equipment-program com-
munication between successive operations in the process (Figure 11.4) and the exten-
sive use of methods for the statistical control of a process as a whole (see Section
10.2) . it being the case that the use of an ASUTP with adaptation is most effective
for many of the technological processes involved in the production of 3615's.

In contrast to extreme control systems (without adaptation), where the optimum
strategy is determined unambiguously (the distribution of probabilities for the ran-
dom variables is assumed to be known), during operation an adaptive control system
must recognize the nature of the random variables and, on the basis of the results
of the analysis. work out some optimum strategy or another. What has been said is
explained by Figure 11.5. From the figure it is obvious that the information enter-
ing the system's input is filtered (by either an equipment or program filter) in or-
der to isolate information related to the effect on the process of uncontrollable
and unmonitorable factors (noise). The results of the primary processing of the in-
formation, on the basis of a mathematical model, are used to predict the course of
the process, as well as to calculate the optimum mode for its conduct. The data ob-
tained are processed in a status analyzer. If the areas of technological process
prediction and optimum process conduct mode do not intersect. control is transferred
to a control process status analyzer that, through a correction unit, makes the ne-
ceSSary correction in the mathematical model in order to improve the quality of the
control process. As soon as areas of prediction and optimum mode intersect, control
is transferred to the unit that is working out the control actions.

The diagram presented for the information processing process in adaptive systems
corresponds to the case where the results of a passive experiment are used in the
mathematical model. An adaptive control system's software can also include an ac-
tive experiment unit that, through an experimental analyzer unit, makes the neces-
sary correction in the mathematical model.

The third clas~ includes ASUTP's that monitor and control groups of processes or a
single complex process within the framework of a production subunit (section, tech-
nological line). ASUTP's in this class are systems of an organizational-
tcchnological nature, which is determined by the purposes and problems involved in
controlling an object.

A system for controlling a group of technological operations is also charged with
organizational control problems that are aimed at reducing disorderliness in a given
production process and optimizing the goods list distribution of the articles being
produced in accordance with the portfolio of orders. In this case direct control of
the technological process is subordinated to more general purposes and goals; that
is. this type of control of technological processes is of the integrated type.

In the general case the structure of integrated control systems is a multilevel one
(normally two or three hierarchical levels). it being the case that at least on the
upper level, the basic link in the automated control system is man. Integrated con-
trol systems are formulated on the basis of ASUTP's from the first or second class-
es. Their introduction is becoming more and more important because they are compo-
nent parts of the production control system as a whole and, therefore, carry out a
definite. more generalized assignment in parallel with the solution of a specific
technological process control problem.

According to the different classes of ASUTP's and the different versions of their
block diagrams. the equipment facilities of ASUTP's can be divided into the

66

following four groups on the basis of their functional purpose:

facilities for processing information and solving technological process control
problems (control computers):

facilities for direct interaction of the ASUTP with the technological equipment
(sensors and actuating members):

facilities for transmitting and converting information from the sensors to the com-
puter and vice versaz

facilities for the interaction of operating personnel with the system.

ASUTP's in the second and (particularly) third classes have a complicated hierarchi-
cal structure (Pigure 11.6) and consist of several computers: a central control
computer and less powerful peripheral control computers that carry out the primary
information processing and realize the special control algorithms.

In the general case. the complex of ASUTP equipment can consist of the following de-
vices:

a central control computer with a priority program interrupt unit. selector and
program-controlled channels, and devices for bilateral automatic exchanges with the
upper-level computer(s) and the lower-level minicomputers that control the separate
technological operations or processes; _

an expanded complex of memory units, including large-capacity magnetic tape and disk
storage units;

a complex of information input-output devices, primarily for digital single-bit and
symbolic information, as well as analog—to-digital and digital-to-analog converters
with channel commutators;

a central monitoring and control board with a mnemonic diagram of the controlled ob-
ject, an information display (for both textual and graphic information), and a docu-
mentation unit:

local subsystems for the automatic monitoring and control of technological opera-
tions, with panels for the bilateral exchange of information with the central con-
trol computer. as well as visual depiction and documentation units:

communication line concentrators with commutators and analog-to-digital and digital-

11.2. AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGICAL PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEM FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE
PASSIVE PART 0? THICK-FILM BGIS'S

Before describing the ASUTP for the production of the passive part of thick-film
3615's, it is necessary to discuss the basic characteristics of this process as a
controlled system. A diagram of the technological process involved in the produc-
tion of thick-film BGIs's is presented in Figure 11.6. From the diagram it is obvi-
ous that the process consists of one group of preparatory and three groups of basic

operations: manufacturing of the passive elements, monitoring-classification and
assembly.

This process is characterized by a large number of technological operations. com-

plexity and an abundance of various random effects; as a consequence, the process's
reproducibility is comparatively low.

The group of operations for the production of the passive elements (preparation of
the pastes, application and vzhiganiye of the conductors, dielectrics and resistors)
determines the integral value of the thick-film technology.

The basic components of the conducting and resistive pastes are finely dispersed
powders of precious metals. a special glass frit and a mixture of organic liquids.
The paste is applied by an automatic UPH3.280.000 unit, which has the following spe-
cifications:

Vzhiganiye of the passive part of thick-film BGIS's is a complex process, for which
a furnace of the SK-lO(l6.5)UP type, having five temperature zones, is used. In the
first and second zones the organic components are eliminated from the paste, in the
third and fourth an oxidation-reduction process takes place, and in the fifth the
glass is sintered with the ceramic substrate, thus completing the process of the
formation of the thick-film resistors.

An analysis of the distribution of reasons for rejection shows that the greatest
percentage of rejection (37 percent) occurs during the inspection after the resist-
ors undergo vzhiganiye, although the causes for the appearance of the defect actual-
ly build up during all the preceding operations and are determined by the quality of
the preparation of the substrate, its dimensions, the shape and quality of the sur-
face. the quality and uniformity of the resistive pastes' composition, the quality
of the pattern, the application conditions and the temperature and temporal condi-
tions of the vzhiganiye process. Thus, the percentage of output of serviceable
BGIs's depends both on controllable and uncontrollable and random factors.

With the help of a mathematical description of this complex process, models for the
technological process involved in the production of the passive part of thick—film

BGIs's have been obtained. For instance. by using screening experiments and the
methods of prior ranking and random balance, the basic factors of the technological

process that have the greatest effect on the reproducibility of the resistors were
discovered. By realizing a fractional factorial experiment of the 26'1 type (see
Chapter 10), it is possible to obtain a mathematical model for the pastes used in
thick-film resistors:

9cm = 0.478 + 0.085x1 + 0.053x4 - 0.07x5 - 0.012x1x5 - 0.012x4x5.

Using this mathematical model, it is possible to exercise control over the technolo-
gical process for producing the passive part of thick-film 8618's according to the

rated value of the resistors' resistance.

Let us examine in more detail an ASUTP for manufacturing the passive part of thick-
film microcircuits (Figure 11.8). This system realizes the following:

local control of the resistor vzhiganiye operation (on the control level):

control of the operations of preparing and applying the resistive pastes (on the
information-advisory level);

operational monitoring and supervisory control of the production of the passive part
of a 8615;

automated statistical monitoring of the thick-film resistors' parameters.

As its main output parameter. the ASUTP uses the percentage of output of serviceable
cards after the resistor vzhiganiye operation.

70
FOR‘OFFNJAl.USE‘0NLY
The ASUTP for the production of the passive part of thick-film BGIs's and “58's is
constructed according to a hierarchical principle. On the upper level of the sys—
tem, analysis of the technological process is carried out and automated statistical
monitoring according to the quality indicator--percentage of output of serviceable
passive cards--is conducted. On the lower level there is automatic or manual (ac-

cording to "advice“ from the system) control of the technological modes in the basic
operations [23].

The nature of the control is determined on the basis of an analysis of information
about the results of the automated statistical monitoring, for the conduct of which
the initial information is a data sample about the resistors' resistance after
vzhiganiye that is obtained from an automatic resistance monitoring unit through a
discrete channel commutator. The initial data are used to calculate the percentage
of output of serviceable cards in the sample, the percentage of output of servicea-
resistors according to their rated values. and the mean arithmetic values and root-
mean-square deviations of the resistance of the resistors in the sample.

Sampling data accumulated over a week's time are used to calculate the average value
of the output quality indicator and the lower monitoring alert boundary. The cur-
rent value of the percentage of output of serviceable cards in a sample is compared
with the value corresponding to the lower monitoring alert boundary, and when it is
greater than the value of this boundary. there is a changeover to automatic control
of the speed of the furnace's conveyor belt. However, if the percentage of output
of serviceable cards in the sample is smaller than the lower monitoring alert limit,
the sampling parameters are analyzed and the results of the analysis are used to
change over either to automatic control of the furnace's conveyor belt's speed ac—
cording to one of the rated values within the limits of the limitations on the tech-
nological vzhiganiye conditions or to the informational-advisory mode of controlling
the resistor application and vzhiganiye operations. In this case, advisory informa-
tion on the change in the technological vzhiganiye (temperature in the furnace's
sintering zone) and paste application (change in the wiper's pressure, replacement
of the pattern and so on) modes is printed out.

If the current value of the percentage of output of serviceable cards in a sample is
below the allowable level, as determined by economic considerations, a recommenda-
tion for replacement of the resistive pastes is printed out. Correspondingly. in—
formation on the distribution of the resistances of the resistors in the sample is
both printed and punched out; the technologist uses this information to make an op-
erational analysis of the process. Information that has been accumulated from sev-
eral samples is processed by statistical analysis programs in a "Minsk-22" computer.

The automatic mode utilizes a self-adjusting algorithm that constructs a mathemati-
cal model of the dependence of the resistors' resistances on the speed of the fur-
nace‘s conveyor belt, with correction of the model's parameters according to the
current values of the resistors' resistances, the conveyor belt's speed v and the
temperature T in the furnace's sintering zone. Information on the temperature and
speed are entered in the computer, from the appropriate sensors, through an analog
channel commutator and an analog-to-codc converter. The mathematical model for the
vzhiganiye process is a second-order polynomial:

R = av2 + bv + c when T - const.

FOR 0F11C¥}L.USE|)NLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

The model's coefficients a, b and c are computed as the result of the solution of a
system of linear equations by Kramer's method. The constructed model's parameters
are used to determine the correcting action Av. which is transmitted through a code-

to-analog converter and the analog channel commutator to the speed regulator, which
changes the furnace's conveyor belt's speed.

Information on the state of the resistive pastes, the resistor application condi-
tions and the planned quota and actual output of articles from the conductor and re-
sistor application and vzhiganiye operations is entered in the computer through one
of the recording devices (a manual input unit, an external UVVI, or the computer's
keyboard register). The resultant control information for the current moment is
printed as a table, with a periodicity determined by the technological cycle for the
resistor vzhiganiye operation, and then transmitted to an information panel through
an independent control board.

The system's hardware complex is based on an ”Elektronika-IOO“ computer. In addi-
tion, the system contains the following equipment:

four temperature sensors, having a measurement range of 250-760°c with sensitivity
of 100 uV/deg;

a speed sensor that converts the furnace's conveyor belt's speed into an analog sig-
nal (1-5 V); the measurement limits are 15-150 nuvmin with a sensitivity of 0.5 v-
-min/mm:

a speed regulator that controls the actuating mechanism that changes the furnace's
conveyor belt's speed within limits of 30-100 mm/min;

automatic resistance monitoring units that convert a resistor's resistance into a
discrete signal with 0.3-percent accuracy; the measurable resistance range is l n to
10 m9:

an automatic card feed and resistor-contact unit that feeds the cards in and sorts
them into three groups; the unit's productivity is 1,600 pieces/h;

an information panel with an independent control board, for the depiction of produc-
tion information.

The system's software includes: program modules for entering the resistors' resist-
ances, the conveyor belt's speed and the furnace's temperature in the computer; sub-
programs for computing the percentage of output and quantity of serviceable cards,
as well as the mean arithmetic value of the resistors' resistances, and analyzing
the technological parameters, computing the change in the conveyor belt's speed.
forming the voltage code according to the computed value of the change in speed.
generating the correcting signal and sending it to the speed regulator, and comput—
ing the root-mean-square deviation; a control program; supervisory information input
programs for the automated statistical monitoring program: supervisory information
printing programs and a series of standard programs for the "Elektronika-loo' com-
puter, such a translation from the decimal to the binary system, multiplication, di-
vision and so on.

By making it possible to achieve the optimum change in the temperature conditions
for vzhiganiye and automatically correct the furnace's conveyor belt's speed, the
introduction of this system into the production process increases the output of
serviceable cards with resistors by more than 10 percent and the productivity of the
technological process by more than 40 percent [23].

CONCLUSION

In order to acquaint the reader with the prospects for the further development of
microelectronics and radio equipment in the next decade and the problems for the so-
lution of which the future engineer specializing in the design and production of REA
must be prepared, let us discuss several prognostic evaluations of the development
of microelectronics and MEA based on it.

Microelectronics will continue to be developed at a rapid rate. It is assumed [11,
18,25] that the rate of growth of the degree of integration of 15's will even in-
crease and that the functional complexity will triple each year. Along with the im-
provement and expansion of production of 15's, there will be created complex solid-
state electronic instruments that perform the functions of units, devices and equip~
ment as a whole. Primary development will be maintained for discrete micro-
electronics; that is, the increase in the degree of integration will take place be-
cause of a reduction in the size of the transistors, diodes and resistors used in an
15 realized inside a silicon monocrystal. At the present time, however, the possi-
bilities of light photolithography can be regarded as exhausted. Therefore. for a
further reduction in the size of IS elements. to (so-100)-1o'4 um, in the next dec-
ade we must see the industrial mastery of new technological methods for forming
structures on the basis of the utilization of electron-beam and x-ray lithography,
ion implantation and ion doping.

In connection with the increase in the functional complexity of 15's and the re-
quirements for improving their quality as well as the efficiency and accuracy of the
manufacturing process, in the next 10 years we must realize complete automation of
the processes involved in designing and producing 15's.

The acceleration of the rate of scientific and technical progress in radioelectron-
ics has resulted in a continuous increase in the complexity of MBA. At the present
time the complexity of some devices has reached 108 elements and is continuing to

grow. Under these conditions, a most important national economic goal is the utmost
possible improvement in the quality and reliability of MBA and the improvment of the

efficiency of its production. The successful solution of these problems is possible
only with full automation of the designing and production of MBA on the basis of the
utilization of computers.

This problem is complicated and multifaceted. For total automation of the designing
of MEA it is necessary, for example, to develop new and more accurate methods for
computer calculation and modeling of the quality characteristics of the MBA being
designed, in order to replace laborious experimental investigations of these charac-
teristics. Further refinement is needed in the methodological questions related to

the creation of automated systems for technological preparation for production, the
automation of technological processes and so on.

Thus, in radio- and microelectronics in the next decade, considerable attention will
be devoted to questions of automating the designing and production of 15's and MBA.

Both domestic and foreign work experience in this area shows that an engineer con-
cerned with automation problems must be a highly qualified specialist both in the
area of designing and producing Han and the area of computer technology and program—
ming. Only when this is the case will the greatest effect in the solution of auto-
mation problems he achieved.

PROCESSING OF EASTER IMAGES OF EXTENDED OBJECTS: PATTERN RECOGNITION

Riga AVTOHATIKA I VYCHISLITEL'NAYA IEKHNIKA in Russian No 6, Nov-Dec 81
(manuscript received 19 Nov 79) pp 63-65

[Article by A. G. Vostretsov. V. I. Kushnir and A. N. Yakovlev]

iText] Discussed in this work is the problem of automatic detection of the image
of a parallelogram. This problem occurs, for example, during the search for and
recognition of extended objects of simple geomteric forms (bars of cylinders,
prisms, etc.) by using side-looking sonar systems with a raster image of the space
being investigated [1]. If the object of the search is located on an underlying
surface, the useful signal has to be picked out of the background of reflections
from this surface. Since the levelsofreflections from the object and the under-
lying surface are different, this isolation can be performed by threshold proces-
sing of preliminarily filtered realizations. As a.result, in each realization the
information of interest to us is a logical voltage‘(chord) convenient for further
digital processing. The aggregate of realizations will make up a raster two-shaded
image of the surface being sounded (she fig. 1). With this method of signal isola-
tion, noise chords caused by the statistical nature of the signals being received

will also appear in the raster in addition to the useful chords belonging to the
objects.

To solve the final problem of automatic
recognition of the objects, it is
necessary to generate the set of chords
in the raster that make up the images of
the individual objects. A feature that
indicates the chords belong to individual
objects is their connectivity [2]. This
condition can be expressed the following

"a" x1¢.~”‘(1+1)b/\"(1+1)e>":n)' “he"
X1b and x1c are the coordinates of the

 

beginning and the end of the chord in the
i-th line, and x(1+1)b and x(i+l)e are

the same in the (i+l)—th line. This

algorithm allows effecting selection of 318. 1.
objects in real time, i.e. at the rate

the information comes in [3].

Alter selection of the chords belonging to individual objects, the problem of iso-
lating the parallelogram image from them is solved. when there is no noise, the
latter is the aggregate of connected chrods, the ends of which lie on straight and
parallel lines called bOunds.

To meet the condition of rectilinearity and parallelism, it is necessary and suffi-
cient that the antioverlaps A1 of the chords at the corresponding bounds be equal

between themselves and coincide in sign. In the process. the "+" sign is assigned
to the antioverlap of two neighboring chords, when the "x" coordinate of the next
chord is greater than that for the preceding, and the "-" in the opposite case.

In real conditions, since the image bounds are distorted by noise, precise equality
of antioverlaps between themselves is not possible. Therefore, there arises the
question of statistical decision-making on the presence of an object.

The algorithm for making a decision on the detection of a parallelogram consists in
checking for the simultaneous meeting of the following conditions:

are competent estimates of the quantities, and n2<n<n1, where n1 and n2 are con-

stants defined by the extent of the objects of the search. The thresholds a and r
are selected based on the specified probability for parallelogram detection.

Algorithm characteristics and the thresholds a and I were found by using the compu-
ter simulation method. As can be seen, the algorithm requires few computations.
Therefore, it can be implemented on the base of a microcomputer or specialized
microprocessor system {4].

circuit, the coordinate output unit (BVK) records the coordinates of the begin-
ning and end of the chords in the current and delayed lines xbl, xbz. xel and x”,

respectively. The images are processed further by using a specialized microcompu-
ter in real time provided that in each line there can be chords belonging to no
more than 10 objects. To implement non-frame processing of an image, the need for
which occurs in operating with side-looking sonars, storage is allocated as follows.

Allocated first in main storage is a region in which the coordinates of the begin-
ning and end of all chords that caused actuation of the AND circuit are recorded
(see fig. 2). The address of the beginning of this region is designated BBC, and
the coordinates are stored in this region in accordance with fig. 3. The absence
of an object is denoted by zeros. As
each new line comes in, the old con-
tents are deleted from the region and
the new recorded. Since each time we
record in storage the chord coordi-
nates from the current and delayed
lines, then for the two successive
records of chord coordinates belonging

 

to an object, the coordinates xbl and Fig. 3. Record of chord coordinates in
sz will match. This fact will be microcomputer storage

number of these increments and the value
of the coordinate sz in the current line (for object identification). We use 10

of these regions. The coordinate of the beginning of the file of these regions is
designated by BEGIN. Indirect addressing is used for efficient use of these
storage regions. Used in the process are a pair of microprocessor registers D and
E and a region in storage, the beginning address of which is designated by ADDR.
Entered in the initial state in the ADDR region serially are the addresses of the
corresponding objects of the storage regions, and the pair of registers D and E
always point to the cells of the ADDR region in which the address of the first cell
of the BEGIN region where there is no object is contained. Thus, kept in the ADDR
region before the cell with the address indicated by registers D and E are the
addresses of the cells from the BEGIN region occupied by objects , and the free
cells come after it. After completion of processing, its address in the ADDR
region changes places with the last processed object, and the D and E registers
begin pointing to this freed region. Thus, the BEGIN region must contain the num-
ber of cells needed to service the maximum number of objects in a line (we use 10).

The automatic image processor is operated as follows. First, the coordinate values
are entered into the BBC storage region. Then a check is made for objects in the
preceding lines by comparing the first free region (0 and E registers) with the
ADDR address. An inequality indicates the presence of objects in the preceding
lines. Then comes selection of chords: picking out the chords belonging to

objects by the feature of matches between the coordinates xbl from the BBC

region and x from the BEGIN region. If these chords are not found for some

b2
objecL, this means it has terminated, and the recognition program is switched on
for it (inequalities (l) and (2) are checked). Then the chords belonging to the
new objects are recorded and the cycle starts again.

This selection and recognition system was tested on a model of signals input into
a microcomputer with 512 bytes of read-only memory and 256 bytes of main storage.

greater importance is being assumed by its effectiveness both from the viewpoint of
validity and soundness of decisions being made and from that of costs and time for
conducting it. Among the means for achieving these aims. a prominent place is held
by the mathematical theory of experiments. While earlier the field of application
of this theory was limited largely to problems of combinatorial and extremal design

of experiments, this fielihasnow been expanded considerably. A major role here

has been played by computers, for which it has been possible on the basis of
numerical methods to develop optimal algorithms for estimation and design of
experiments.

This work, a logical continuation of the monograph, "Design of Experiments for
{34] deals with a systematic examina-

Identification and Extrapolation Problems,
tion of methods of experimental design for two new problems: nonlinear
estimation and pattern recognition.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
The nonlinear estimation problem occurs in constructing complex mathematical models,
nonlinear relative to the parameters being estimated, that describe physical and
chemical mechanisms of the processes and phenomena under investigation. The prob-
lem is solved under the conditions of the effect in the general case of nonadditive,
non-Gaussian, non-white noise. Such models afford fine prediction properties over
a wider range of variation of input variables with a fewer number of estimated
parameters than the polynomial regression models do.

Nonlinear models are finding ever greater application not only in scientific re-
search. bot also in setting up automated process control systems. A brief survey
or 1L9 numerous works accomplished in this field is given in this book. Special
attention is paid to the problem, important from the practical viewpoint, of study-
ing the capability of applying a priori synthesized optimal experimental designs
that are more convenient than sequentially computed and implemented designs. He
consider optimal algorithms for designing experiments in nonlinear estimation by
using the methods of least squares and maximum likelihood and with the Bayes'
approach.

The second problem involves the situation when the output variable has a funda-
mentally qualitative nature. In contrast to traditional statements of pattern
recognition and classification problems, considered in this book is the case when
the researchereexperimenter has the opportunity of controlling the source statisti-
cal material (training sample) and in this sense, designing the experiments.

The problem is considered in two aspects: statistical and determinist. It is
shown that in the first case, the problem can be reduced to a partial stetement of
nonlinear estimation. The most promising objects of application of the algorithms
developed here are automated systems for quality control of mass production. The
determinist approach to design of the separating surface, particularly sequential
design of experiments in refining the estimates of parameters of this surface, is
very effective in computer-aided design of complex systems and the study of the
regions of factor space in which the specified properties of the e systems are
afforded.

It should be noted that all the algorithms given in this book for estimation and
design of experiments have been implemented as computer programs and registered in
the USSR State Library of Algorithms and Programs. They have also been tested in
a large number of model problems and successfully adopted in industry.

This book is intended for the continually growing number of specialists and re-
searchers mastering modern mathematical models and facilities of computer
technology.

These programs have been tested in solving a number of practical problems.

The algorithms for nonlinear estimation and pattern recognition have also been in-
cluded in the "DIPLEX" and "PLANEKS" software systems developed at the Problem
Laboratory of Automatic and Remote Control, Hoscow Power Engineering Institute
(Order of Lenin).

The "PLANEKS" applications program package (FF?) is intended for calculating ex-
periment designs and statistical processing of observation data in scientific and
industrial research. The package modules afford an efficient solution to problems
associated with building models of objects from experimental data and encompass
all basic stages of research: 1) test of statistical hypothesis, study of laws of
distribution of random quantities, analysis of measurement data; 2) estimation of
parameters of a mathematical model of specified structure and statistical analysis
of estimation results; 3) optimal design of an experiment for achieving the model
properties desired.

The "PLANEKS" package is oriented primarily to research permitting control of the
conditions for performing experiments (active experiment). At the same time,
mathematical model parameter estimates can also be computed from data on observa-
tions on the object under investigation.

The package can be used to select the best model, estimate the parameters entering
linearly and nonlinearly into a regression model and perform discriminant analysis
of data.

"PLANEKS" package users do not have to have programming skills. Simplicity and
convenience of package application are achieved by writing the specifications for
computations in rather free nonalgorithmic form in a problem-oriented language
(POYa) close to the natural language of the subject area.

The "PLANEKS" package can be applied by users with a varying degree of knwoledge
on methods of experiment design and statistical data processing. The package con-
trol program includes blocks enabling problem solution even there is no explicit
indication of the required algorithm for computations in the specification. In
this case, the computational scheme is selected either from available source data
or based on user responses to questions in a special questionnaire. The package
is also an effective means for training users in the methodology of a given sub-
ject area. Included in it for this is a subsystem for analysis of the input job
that enables detection of errors and recognition of the type of problem, as well
as output of indications of source data missing in the specification that is

needed for application of a particular computational scheme. By using simple in-
structions in the POYa, package users are given the capability of modifying

computational schemes by changing the algorithms for searching for the extremum of
a function,_criteria of optimality of designs, type of design area, type of model
of the research object, etc.

By using the design Subsystem, users can extend the package by connecting to it
their own problem programs and use them in the library mode.

The “PLANEKS” package structure permits rather simple modification and expansion
of the subject field by including in it new algorithms and expanding the terminol-
ogy of the problem~oriented language.

The package is built on the modular principle and includes over 100 modules.

The package has been implemented for the Unified System of Computers within the
bounds of the res DOS operating system (version 2.1). For normal operation,

128K bytes of main storage are required. The software modules have been
checked out in PL/l.

The interactive "DIPLEX" software system is intended for experiment design and
processing of observation data in systems for automation of scientific research
based on the SH-E, su-a and H-6000 computers with at least 24K bytes of main
storage. The system does not require the user to program problems and can perform
the functions of a consultant on statement of research problems and application of
programs included in its library. Included in the "DIPLEX" system is the program
for nonlinear estimation by the Marquardt method (similar to P001982) and
sequential design of experiments with refinement of model parameters (similar to

P003155).

i'rext] Successful resolution of the problems associated with the study and ratio-
nal use of ocean resources would be impossible without making use of the most
modern hardware for automated experimental data acquisition, processing, storage,
retrieval and presentation in a form convenient for research. The systems ap-
proach to the study of the physical fields of the ocean and their interrelation,
typical of modern oceanology, the extension of the time and spatial scales of re-
search and the intensification of use of specially equipped scientific research
vessels (N18) lead to the need for acquiring and processing large anounts of data.
Processing of oceanologic information obtained on trips is now inconceivable with-
out extensive application of electronics and computers combined into a system for
automation of scientific research (SARI). A basic feature of these systems is
that their platform is a scientific research vessel equipped with complexes of in-
struments for performing multidimensional ocean research. As a rule, instruments
are placed in shipborne scientific laboratories when they are pertinent to an ex-
periment. The specific nature of operation of a scientific research vessel may be
determined by the need of performing scientific experiments in various fields of
ocean science. By radio channels (including satellite), a shipborne SARI can be
linked to conunication processors of ground networks, performing in this case
functions of a node of a computer system [1]. Such communication provides the
capability of exchanging with shore computers information concerning the current
trip or preceding research.

The task of automating research performed by multipurpose scientific research ships
is complicated by such factors as the diversity of the physical quantities to be
measured and their characteristics, the presence of a considerable number of
methods for measuring the various physical quantities, the nonuniform procedures
for recording data when using deck, towed and sounding apparatus, the need for
collecting data from large areas over a long time period in a wide range of studies,
the uniqueness of individual studies, the diversity of algorithms for recording

and processing the data obtained, as well as the need for rapid configuration of

the structure of the scientific research automation system in accordance with the
requirements of new experiments, enhanced demands on system reliability, etc.

The data recorded both during the trip and after its completion must be accessible
and understandable not only to those who directly organized the performance of u
given experiment, but also to a broader range of users.

Let us consider the structure and design principles of the scientific research
automation system for multipurpose scientific research vessels using as an example
the integrated system for automation of scientific research under development for
the "Akademik Hatislav Keldysh" scientific research ship, being constructed at the
"Khollming" a/o [joint-stock company] shipyard (Rauma, Finland) for the USSR
Academy of Sciences.

This system combines into a common entity the facilities for automating oceanologic
experiments, automatic facilities for vessel navigation, including earth satellite
communication facilities, facilities for acquisition of meteosynoptic data and
facilities of electronic computer equipment in the form of a single-node network of
various computers and crates with CAHAC modules, supported by the necessary inter-
face facilities and software. The system includes a computer center (VTs) and over
10 permanently operating laboratory and thematic subsystems (see fig. 1).

The laboratories are equipped with computers and thematic

The thematic

laboratories are called upon to provide for acquisition, recording and processing
(primary, and even secondary when necessary) of data pertaining to the fields of

ocean and environmental sciences represented by them.

Data are recorded in the

form of values of sampled physical quantities (parameters) both during extended

environmental characteristic measurements and as a result of one-time (discrete)
measurements and laboratory analyses of environmental samples taken. Laboratory
computers can operate in three modes: standalone, as preprocessora when data is
recorded by a center computer and as terminals for center computers. Data recorded
in laboratory subsystems in the form of sets of parameter values are accumulated

in the center recording subsystem and ordered and then become accessible to users
in other laboratories.

Maximal flexibility in building these systems is afforded by application of the
hierarchical principle in designing the structure with a hierarchy distributed by

levels for data recording, processing and storage and of the bus-modular method for
organizing hardware and software at all levels.

By the bus-modular principle, we mean organizing a system of independent unit-
modules united by common protocols for data and command exchange. Hardware modules
capable of data exchange are linked by a bus, and the individual lines can be used
for data transfer and address specification, synchronization and control. Buses
can be machine-dependent, oriented to a specific family of computers, or machine-
independent, oriented to a certain group of problems, and not to a type of computer.
The latter, for example, include the CAHAC crate bus (2]. Each functional module
capable of data exchange over the bus is assigned its own address (or group of ad-
dresses). Depending on system complexity, the functional modules may be individual
hardware units (instruments) or entire subsystems. Data (messages) are exchanged
with each module under control of the appropriate driver program. Preparation of
messages for transfer, their reception and, when necessary, initiation of retrans-
mission are performed by individual program modules.

The integrated system for the "Akadanik Hstislav Keldysh" scientific research ship
has four levels in the hierarchy (see fig. 2). Each level has modules with the
capability of being programmed and performing particular processing of data re-
ceived from the lower levels, including from primary transducers.

The top (first) level in the hierarchy consists of the data recording and processing
Subsystems for the ship computer center that are linked by the dual control communi-
cation subsystem. These subsystems operate independently of each other and have
the capability of mutually starting and stopping programs and exchange of ready
files of programs and data. In hardware composition, these subsystems largely
duplicate each other and both have minicomputers, disk storage units with over
lOOM-byte capacity each, magnetic tape and floppy disk storage units, alphanumeric
and graphic terminals, digitizers and other data input/output devices. Along with
recording in the Integrated System, this provides the capability for substantial
secondary (thematic) processing of data recorded during a trip, and for preparing
data on media in a form suitable for transfer to shore centers, including for ex-
change with international data centers, imediately after the trip without addi-

tional processing. The main interface at the t.-.. --~‘ ‘3 the minicomputer output
bus.

Functional modules in the lower level of the hierarchy with respect to computer
center subsystems are the laboratory and thematic subsystems, as well as some addi-
tional data input, output and storage units, for example, the video monitors placed
in various rooms on the ship. These functional modules are joined, just as in the
computer center. minicomputers, by the bus of the dual control cocnunication

subsystem, which as implied by its title, can be alternately under the control of
both computers. with that, there is the capability of sharing the peripherals
(disk storage, for instance) between the two computers, which together with mutual
starting and stopping of programs and exchange of data files and programs, provides
the capability of organizing a two-machine complex at the top level. when the re-
cording subsystem computer goes down, its functions are assumed by the other compu-
ter. Hith that, data processing is temporarily halted, and the same version of the
operating system and recording programs in use on the malfunctioning computer is
loaded on the second computer. After recovery of operating capability, the first
computer can again assume control of the functional modules in the laboratory and
thematic subsystems, and the released resources of the second computer can be used
for processing data recorded earlier.

The second level in the hierarchy is formed by the Navigational Subsystem, the Sub-
system for the Sonic Depth Finders, the Automatic Weather Station, the Ship CAHAC
Subsystem, as well as the seven laboratory subsystems having a computer in their
composition. All subsystems except the CAMAC are considerably remote from the com-
puter center. Therefore, data is transferred from them through serial communica-
tion lines (for example, in accordance with the RS-232 C standard i3]), to which are
connected modems that effect full galvanic isolation of the subsystems. Communica-
tion between the computer center crates and the laboratories within the CAHAC sub-
systtm is effected through serial communication lines with high throughput (up to
1M bits/second) and special CAHAC modules playing the role of interface cards.

A feature of the second level subsystems is horizontal (between functional modules
on the same level) as well as vertical (from level to level) communication, such as
between, for instance, the automatic weather station and the meteosynoptic labora-
tory computer. The availability of horizontal communication in the system allows
reducing the overall amount of equipment and raising the flexibility of the system
as a whole through a different degree of processing of the indications from the

same transducers and the use of thematic subsystems for laboratory resources. The
main interfaces on the second level of the hierarchy are the machine-dependent buses
of the laboratory and automatic weather station computers and the machine-indepen-
dent bus for the CAHAC crate.

Subsystems in the third level of the hierarchy and autonomous laboratory instru-
ments can be functional modules of second-level subsystems. Since all modules are
connected through separate interface cards, expanding the system by connecting
autonomous scientific instruments on the second level entails reducing the capa-
bilities for reconfigurations and complicates programming. It is advisable to con-
nect autonomous instruments to the third or lower levels of the hierarchy by
standard interfaces, [56 buses for example [4].

There are two types of subsystems on the third level of the hierarchy in the inte-
grated system: specialized units based on microprocessors and subsystems formed by
instruments. Requirements imposed on third-level interfaces are largely conflicting
in terms of throughput, minimization of interface apparatus, simplification and
standardization of programs servicing input/output, capability of rapid subsystem
reconfiguration, etc. Therefore, it is difficult to point to one universal method
in building third-level subsystems and compromises have to be made. In the
specialized units based on microprocessors, such as for example the scintillation
counter in liquids in the microbiological laboratory, the buses of the appropriate

families of microprocessors are used for data exchange between third-level modules.
This apparatus is used far measurements and primary processing of data from analy-
sis of environmental samples (sea water, most often). Data is processed in it
quite thoroughly and fully, and generalized characteristics of samples are sent to
the laboratory computers. The computer capacities of subsystems at higher levels
are used largely only for statistical processing of results and for generalized
analysis of sample characteristics. Data flows between these subsystems and those
on the second level are not characterized by high intensity; therefore, communica-
tion between them can be implemented through a serial line (according to the

RS-232 C standard, for example) and the appropriate interface card for each
subsystem.

0n the whole it can be stated that beginning at this level, machine-independent
buses should be used. More characteristic for the third level in the hierarchy is
two-way data transfer over a bus with an 8-bit width.

A typical representative of this trend is the above-mentioned IBC ilnternational
Electrotechnicsl Commission] bus, which, just as the CAHAC crate bus, is a univer-
sal means of interface in automating scientific research. Modules for communica-
tion with this bus are part of the equipment in all the laboratories on the
scientific research vessel. The IEC bus permits combining into a subsystem the
instruments distributed throughout the laboratories, including several controller
instruments. They do not impose rigid restrictions on the designs, in contrast to
the CAHAG crates, and permit building subsystems from instruments, series produced
in various countries, that are intended both for operation within a system and for
autonomous use. In the process, the capability is provided for remote addressing
and changing an instrument address, building the simplest systems without a con-
troller, and exchanging data, bypassing the controller, directly between the ad-
dress source and one or more address listeners. The bus also implements a number of
other capabilities [4, 5] and is the optimal for uniting autonomous instruments
having various degrees of "intelligence." Let us note that theoretically, an IEC
bus throughput up to 1H bytes/second is attainable at a length up to 20 m. Several
interface cards for the 186 bus can be connected to one laboratory computer, and
the group of instruments joined by each bus can be very complex subsystems at the
third level of the hierarchy.

The fourth and lower levels of the hierarchy in the integrated system structure are
formed by the deck and underwater devices of the various sounds and samplers, as
well as the instruments and systems of various degrees of complexity that are con-
nectable to the crate modules of the CAHAC subsystem. The availability in the
CAMAC apparatus of modules for communication between CAHAC and the ISO bus is a
very powerful means for automating laboratory research. This characteristic fea-
ture of the structure of the scientific research automation system being described
affords it increased flexibility and the capability of adding to it.

Data obtained in laboratories can be stored for some time in the laboratory compu-
ters before transferring it to a subsystem. Data obtained at different times in
different laboratories and in different regions of the study can be grouped into
the same recording subsystem file. After preparation of the completed data files,
they are output to magnetic tape and can be stored for a long time in an archive.

FOItCHWNCJAl.USlZ(MHLY
Used in this automation system is the flexible structure of self-identification of
data E6] on the two upper levels of the hierarchy, under which all data obtained
are supplied with labels (tags) indicating their type, properties. time and place
of recording, etc. The system software structure presupposes that the entire set
of parameters being recorded is divided into subsets. each of which is assigned to
a specific laboratory. The structure for division of the set of parameters and
their description is specified in the parameter description table. It is a resource
for the computer center recording subsystem which can be modified and supplemented
by the software method both before and during a trip by the vessel. The parameter
description table determines the general research direction. Only values for those
parameters described in this table can be measured and recorded. There are also a
number of parameters, sufficiently important for all laboratories, the values of
which can be added in the form of tags to the data obtained from laboratory subsys-
tems to increase their information content. These include primarily information on
the time and place of data recording, coordinates of the ship's location, on the
state of the environment, etc. These parameters are updated periodically by the
thematic subsystems and form the so-called status table. The procedure for updat-
ing status table parameter values differs from that for recording the experimental
data being collected by the scientific equipment on the vessel. It is loosely re-
lated to current operations in laboratories during trips and essentially does not
change from trip to trip. Therefore, in defining the integrated system structure,
it was deemed expedient to separate the flows of status table parameter values from
the main data flows and to organize additional communication channels to transfer
them to the upper level. Organized this way are the channels from the navigation
system (data on ship location), the automatic weather station (data on the environ-
ment) and from the subsystem for the sounding devices in the geophysical

laboratory (data on depth).

A given set of ready files of recorded data is retrieved by using the directory,
each record of which is created automatically upon completion of recording of a
data file in turn. Elementary directory records describe the name and version of
the completed file, the magnetic tape volume number, time and place of data record-
ing, as well as the list of names (codes) recorded in the file of parameters.

Let us discuss the procedure for recording data from extended measurements during
deep sounding of sea water by the hydrological laboratory apparatus (see figs. 3
and 4), fitted with transducers for pressure, temperature, electrical conduction,
transmittance, concentration of hydrogen ions (pa), as well as a diaphragm pickup
of the oxygen content in the water. This apparatus is lowered by using a special
winch along with water samplers (bathometers) to 6500 m depth in the ocean and
performs vertical sounding. Samples can be taken by the bathometers at any depth
upon command from the deck unit sent manually or by computer. In one sounding. up
to 12 sea water samples can be taken at various depths. 0n the ship, these samples
undergo laboratory analyses which result in a large quantity of values of discrete
parameters assigned to the various laboratories. In addition to transducers and
bathometers, the lowered apparatus contains an electronic unit, protected from
pressure, that effects time multiplexing (HP), analog-to-digital conversion (AID)
and frequency modulation (FSK) for transmission of the values obtained over the
cable to the deck unit. The deck unit performs demodulation (DH), selection of the
fields belonging to each transducer in the word received (SC), calculation on the
data received of the corresponding engineering quantities (CALC), display of data

and also sends over the IEC bus to the laboratory computer messages in the same
format as that of the data recorded on the digital magnetic tape recorder. The
laboratory computer program effects selection of the cycle of the data and the time
of their entry (SEL), and the bus interface card provides for addressing of the deck
unit (ADDR), issuing to it the necessary commands (COMM) and synchronization when
data is received (HS). In the laboratory computer, the data undergo functional con-
versions (F) with intermediate storage of results in memory (H). They are used to
calculate (CALC) design parameters (salinity, seawater density, dynamic depth, etc.).
For transfer to the computer center recording subsystem, the data are first formed
into messages (FORM) standard for this scientific research automation system.

Data is converted from parallel form to serial and back by the interface cards for
the serial line of communication to the computer center computer and for the
laboratory computer.

If the laboratory computer is malfunctioning, the experiment can still be continued
according to the scheme described up to an including data logging on the digital
magnetic tape recorder. Forming of the final files in this case is done later when
the data is processed from the digital magnetic tape recorder on the computer for
the ship computer center processing subsystem or on the laboratory computer after
recovery of operating capability.

The logging subsystem computer programs add the necessary tags for location and
environment, foam (FORM) the data obtained in accordance with the protocols
selected in the system, accumulate them on magnetic disks (ACC) and recopy the
final files on magnetic tape (8) for keeping (K).

In transferring data from the place of origination to the place of logging, there
occur delays, the resulting value of which depends on many factors, primarily on
the specific mode of operation of the laboratory subsystem. Hardware delays are

105

usually slight and can be taken into account analytically. The other portion of
delays occur through distribution of processing and logging by levels of the
hierarchy and by using the current schedule of programs for the logging subsystem;
their values in practice cannot be determined analytically in each specific case.
In the example described, the delay in transferring measurement data to the
laboratory computer is measured in tenths of a second. In the laboratory computer.
conversions and computations take 0.5-2 seconds as a function of the length of the
corresponding branch of the program. Message transfer time over the serial line of

communication (Ttrans) with a lZOO-baud throughput varies from i to 4 seconds as

a function of message length. In general form, for the delay in transfer from the
second to the third level taking repeat requests into account, one can write:

T - Tpro + Twait + Tprep + “Ttrans + (n-l)Tresp’ where Tpro is the execution time

of the program accepting messages from the appropriate subsystem up to the time the
data is received and transferred to the logging program; Twait is the time waiting

for use of the bus for the upper level (depends on how intensively the programs
assigned for execution are using the procedures for exchange with modules having
a higher bus priority than the given subsystem); n - i, 2, 3 is the number of
transfers over the communication line with regard to the three possible requests

for repetition during transfer of the given message; Tprep is the message prepara-

esp is the response time of this compu-

ter to the byte for a repeat request. Thus, for the given example, the total delay
in some cases may be 12-15 seconds. To prevent the effect of these delays on the
quality of logging and capability of comparing logged data, it is advisable to
assign the log time tags at the lower levels of the hierarchy (as close as possible
to the place of origination of the data). Including real-time clocks in the
individual laboratory instruments cannot be justified economically and is not
always possible; therefore, in the scientific research automation system in ques-
tion, hardware or software real-time clocks have been incorporated as part of all
subsyStema in the second level of the hierarchy and there are facilities for
synchronizing them with the clocks in the logging subsystem. Let us note that
including synchronizable real-time clocks in the second-level subsystems permits
assigning the time tags also when the laboratory subsystems are operated in the
offline mode, thereby raising the flexibility of the integrated system as a whole
and creating the capability of restoring the final files in the logging subsystem
at any time after performance of the experiment.

Conclusions

1. In developing scientific research automation systems for multipurpose scien-
tific research vessels, maximum flexibility is afforded by using the hierarchical
system structure with distributed processing of data received by levels of the
hierarchy and use of the bus-modular method for organizing the hardware at all
levels in the hierarchy.

2. in developing the software structure for scientific research automation sys-
tems, it is advisable to provide for a parameter description table as a modifiable
resource of the logging subsystem. This table must contain descriptions of each
parameter, describing thereby the entire set of parameters to be logged and
assigning them to specific laboratory and thematic subsystems.

3. In developing the structure for scientific research automation systems, it is
advisable to isolate common parameters and organize a table of their values that
are updated periodically. It is advisable to separate the flows of values of
parameters in this table from other data flows and send them to the top level in
the hierarchy over separate lines of communication.

4. It is advisable to organize not only vertical, but also horizontal links
between subsystems to increase the flexibility and extend the functional capabili-
ties in the structure for scientific research automation systems.

5. The proper selection of interfaces for the various levels in the hierarchy is
of special importance in building scientific research automation systems. It is
advisable to use machine-dependent interfaces at the upper levels and machine-
independent ones at the lower. Among the latter, there should be used primarily
international standards such as CAHAC and the IEC bus, and the latter will
apparently be used more extensively in these systems. Uniting the capabilities
of both standards by using the appropriate CAHAC modules is the optimum for
obtaining the maximally flexible system.

6. To organize a flexible structure for storing data and shaplify processing of
it, it is advisable to employ a system of data identification using tags. The
paramount tags for ship scientific research automation systems are those for
time, location and environment.

7. It is advisable to add the time tags as close as possible to the place of data
origination. Optimum is the incorporation of real-time clocks in all subsystems
in the second level of the hierarchy. Facilities to synchronize them are also
required.

8. Is is advisable to provide a directory to facilitate retrieval of a specified
set of finished files of logged data. Each elementary entry in the directory is
created automatically upon completion of logging of each file in turn.

[Text] Determining the economic efficiency of an ASUP [Automated Enterprise
Control System] involves a number of special features which make it more diffi-

cult to calculate than the economic efficiency of using new equipment. Among
these features are the following:

1. the impossibility of determining the quantitative parameters
of the consequences of using the ASUP in a number of areas of
an enterprise's production and management activity;

2. the extensive interchangeability of facilities and the greet
variation in the composition of A50? hardware;

3. the significant effect that the organization of the control
object has on the efficiency of results of the ASUP;

a. the effect of the dimensionality of problems being solved on
the economic results of AS“? activity;

5. the great impact of selection of initial problems on the
prospects of system development;

6. the comprehensive and interrelated character of all areas
of A80? functioning.

In other words, the ASUP is expected to assume the main burden in processing
management information. Therefore, any shortcomings in this element will be re-
flected immediately in the efficiency of its functioning.

Calculating the annual volume of marketable output. The introduction of an
ASUP makes it possible to increase the volume of marketable output with existing
production capacities by raising the labor productivity of the primary workers and

112
INNR(Nﬂﬂ(1Al.USB(NVLY

by better use of equipment. The increase in production volume is taken into
account in calculations of economic activity if it is planned in future and cur-
rent enterprise development plans. If the growth in volume of output is not
planned, calculations of the economic efficiency of the AS“? take account only

of the decrease in number of alployeea resulting from the rise in labor produc-
tivity.

The rise in the labor productivity of primary production workers results from
decreases in work time lost within shifts. unproductive labor expenditures owing
to organizational factors, and equipment downtime and umderloading. These im-
provements are achieved as the result of the following:

1. optimization of technical-economic and operational-
calendar planning and of decisions on equipment loading.

sizes of batches, and cycles of launching and producing
parts;

2. improvement of operational regulation of production based on
receiving prompt, reliable information on the production
situation;

3. evening out the production and marketing of output;
6. improving material—technical supply;
5. reducing the labor-intensivenesa of output produced:

6. reducing losses from defective goods and unproductive
expenditures.

The annual volume of marketable output (A2) after introduction of the A30? is cal-
culated by the formula

A2 - AI-v, (3.1)

where v is the coefficient of growth of production of output, and Al is the annual
voluae of sale of output before introduction from the ASUP, in thousands of rubles.
The coefficient of growth of production of output is:

_ 100 - a2
100 - 81’

where a] and a2 are losses of working time that affect the volume of output pro-
duced (unproductive work as a percentage of actual available working time) before
and after the introduction of the ASUP, in percentage.

v (8.2)

Calculating change in the prime cost of enterprise output. The amount of change
in prime cost is determined by actual change in cost elements which are affected
by introduction of the ASUP.

Current expenditures are grouped by sub-heading: raw and processed materials.
fuel and energy for production needs, basic wages of production workers, deduc-
tions for social insurance, expenditures for preparation and incorporation of

113
FOR‘OFHKJAI.UBE(MVLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

production, expenditures for equipment maintenance and operation. shop expen-
ditures. general plant expenditures, losses from defective goods. other production
expenditures, and nonproduction expenditures.

To calculate economic efficiency from these sub-headings individual expenditures
are singled out and divided into conditional-permanent expenditures and variable
expenditures .

Following this. the prime cost of output is:
C ' C", + c", (8.3)

where C" is variable expenditures and CI" is conditional-permnent expenditures
(in thousands of rubles.

The absolute savings from lowering prime cost by introduction of an ASUP into
production is formed from the reduction of expenditures that are directly pro-
portional to production volume.

The annual savings of variable expenditures is determined from the formula:

33:, - AC3 + A3“ -:- ACQP+AC$W (8.4)
where AC“:A is the savings from lowering cost for mterials, A3’ is the savings
on the wages fund. AC‘J, is the savings from reducing losses owing to defective
goods and LCM“. is the savings from reducing nonproductive expenditures (all
figures in thousands of rubles).

The savings from reducing material expenditures is determined by the formula
AC: = C“, - B, (8.5\

where C1." is the overexpenditure of raw and processed materials before intro—
duction of the ASUP (in thousands of rubles). and B is a coefficient that char-

acterizes the possible decrease in overexpenditure of raw and processed materials

The savings on the wages fund is determined by the formula
as‘ - 531* - A32“, (8.6)

where A315 is the savings from releasing engineering-technical personnel in the
administrative apparatus, and A3! is the slowdown in growth of the wages fund
for primary workers taking into account the faster rate of growth of labor
productivity and the growth rate of average wages (both figures in thousands
of rubles).

The partial release of engineering-technical emloyees belonging to the adminis-
trative apparatus of the plant and the shops will be expressed as follows:

up - A33h + A33, (8.7)

where A33,A is the savings on the wages fund with deductions for social in-
surance. achieved by reducing the number of engineers. technicians. and plant
administrator personnel, and A3“A is the savings on the wages fund with deduc-

tions for social insurance, achieved by reducing the nulber of engineers, tech-
nicians, and shop administrative personnel (both figures in thousands of rubles).

The slowdown in growth* in the wages fund of primary workers is determined
by the formula

532* - 3(v - l)u - 53* , (8.8)

where a is the coefficient of the ratio of the rate of growth in average wages
to rate of growth in labor productivity of production workers - it is set by
sectors taking into account the inlenemtation of steps to raise production effi.

ciency; 3 is the annual fund of prinary and supplenentsry wages for production
personnel with deductions for social insurance, in thousands of rubles; and. A?
is the reduction in supplementary pay for overtime work, in thousands of rubles.

the savings fron reducing losses owing to defective goods (50“,) is determined
by direct calculation.

Introduction of an ASUP lakes it possible to cut nonproduction expenditures which
are included in shop and plant-wide expenditures:

403“..- ‘caues + “can. u o (8-9)

where Acne". 9 is the decrease in nonproduction expenditures in plant-wide
expenditures. and 11cm,” is the reduction in nonproduction expenditures in

shop expenditures (both figures in thousands of rubles). The decrease in non—
production expenditures is deternined by direct calculation.

Using these calculations it is possible to determine the amount of the annual
savings of variable expenditures (8.6). Conditional-permanent expenditures are
included in prime cost without change.

The slowdown in growth of plant expenditures at the enterprise with an operating
A811? is determined by the fornula:

where Cu is shop expenditures before introduction of the ASUP. in thousands of
rubles. and Pa is the coefficient of dependence of growth in shop expenditures
on growth in production volume.

The slowdown in growth of plant-wide expenditures after introduction of the A50?
is determined as follows:

4c3 A - C3(v - 1m - oaf- 4cm“, (8.11)

where c3 is plant-wide expenditures before introduction of the ASUP, in thousands
of rubles. and P3 is the coefficient of dependence of growth in plant-wide expen-
ditures on growth in production volume.

the prime cost of output after introduction of the A80? is expressed as follows:

where 69.; is operating expenditures for functioning of the A50? (naintenance of
the computer center and system operation). and C is the prime cost of output be-
fore introduction of the ASUP.

* Slowdown in growth reflects the fact that 'the use of an ASUP reduces costs ac—
cordingly, but these expenditures nust be subtracted from the total amount when
determining the total savings.

Calculating capital expenditures for design and setting up the ASUP. Expendi-

tures related to the design and introduction of the ASUP are expressed by the
formula:

Kn“ - K" + K0“ + Aoc‘ + 1,9— Ka‘", (8.14)

where K{‘ is expenditures for system design, K0“ in expenditures for purchase of
the set of A80? hardware, AO¢‘ is change in the amount of working capital with
introduction of the ASUP, Kn“ is the balance value of liquidatable equipment,
devices. buildings, and structures which were not in use before introduction of
the ASUP and cannot be sold (subtracting scrap metal), and K3,; is the balance
value of released equipment, devices, buildings, and structures which will be
used in the ASUP or other sectors of production. or sold on the side (all figures
in thousands of rubles).

The calculation of change in norm-controlled working capital with introduction
of the A50? should take account of the increase in working capital related to
growth in the volume of output sold resulting from introduction of the system.
as well as the reduction in working capital (resulting from stepping up the rate
of turnover of working capital):

Determination of the annual economic impact from introduction of the ASUP. Hhen
determining the economic efficiency of an ASUP it is mandatory to correlate all
indicators by time and prices used to determine indicators and by elements of
expenditures. All value indicators are determined by wholesale prices and wage
and salary rates existing at the moment of the calculation.

The basis for comparison that is used in determining the expected annual economic
impact is planned indicators of production-management activity at an existing
enterprise, and the technical-economic indicators of the plan for those areas of

above.

With an operating ASUP. nonproduction expenditures related to payment of fines

and penalties are reduced as the result of improving monitoring of performance
of economic contracts, payments of accounts with suppliers. and receiving pay-
ments from customers, in other words, through operational control of enterprise
financial relations. The additional profit received from eliminating these ex-

penditures, which are not part of the prime coat of output produced. is con-v

sidered additionally in annual growth in profit 3... and, correspondingly. in the
annual economic inset 3.

pact; in the absence of such a coefficient. 8,. is taken as equal to 0.15.

8.3. Example of Determining the Economic Efficiency of an ASUP

The calculation is based on the hypothetical data (shown in Table 8.1 below) for
analysis of the economic activity of an enterprise in the period preceding intro-
duction of an ASUP. The analysis was made in 1976, then development of the sys-
tem began in 1977 and introduction of the A811? was completed in 1981.

[Text] At the present tine ASUP's [Automated Enterprise Control Systems] are
being set up at 51 ferrous metallurgical enterprises [26]. By suhsectors they
break down as follows: metallurgy - 67 percent; pipe production - 22 percent;
mining - 17 percent; general metal products — eight percent; coke-chemical -—
four percent; refractory products - two percent. The sector has 192 computers,
65 of them third-generation. Accounting jobs make up the bulk of the tasks of
the ASUP's. About 8,000 persons are engaged in setting up the ASUP's.

The Dnepropetrovsk Metallurgical Plant imeni Petrovskiy is one of the enter-
prises at which work is underway to set up an ASUP. By the end of the 10th

Five-Year Plan the enterprise will have incorporated 112 tasks in seven sub-
systens. The most efficient groups of tasks are:

a. planning, operational accounting, and monitoring performance
of orders;

b. planning, accounting, and analysis of wages;

c. planning, operational bookkeeping, analysis, and control of
stocks of material assets.

The basic hardware of the second phase of the A811? is a machine couple: con-
sisting of two computers, a Minsk-22 and an Yes-1020. A distinctive feature of
the second phase is the use of display equipment and developing interactive
"man-nachine" systems.

Operational information on the course of production in the primary shops of the
plant is received and stored on Yes-1020 magnetic media. 0n demnd by five sub-
scribers this information can be outputted to a screen and. used for its desig-
nated purpose of improving control of primary production. It takes 0.5 seconds
to output one videogram. Table 9.1 below shows a possible videogran.

The Dispatcher interactive system is now being introduced. It will make it
possible to establish direct communication between the plant dispatcher and
the computers. After preliminary processing the computer will Output infor-
nation to punched tape, and with teletype it will be transmitted to higher
levels. Introduction of the interactive system will eliminate manual labor by
the computer operator to punch about 6,000 characters of daily information,
the mistakes which an operator can make, and the intervention of uninformed
persons in the process of preparing important and responsible information.

The problem set called "Analysis of Deviation of Coke Expenditure and Produc-
tivity of Blast Furnaces by Factors" is a part of the automated subsystem
called "Operational Control of Primary Production." This set of tasks processes
operational and monthly information received from the plant services. As input
information it uses the results of the sets of tasks called "Accounting

for Blast Production" and "Accounting for Raw Materials." The input informa.
tion, prepared on punched tape (an ST-ZH unit) and received from the Hinsk-ZZ
computer, is fed to the Yes-1020 computer, monitored, and processed in con-
formity with algorithms.

The results of problem-solving, represented in the form of eight documents for
blast furnaces and for the shop, are used by the plant services: the blast
furnace shop, the central plant laboratory, and the production division. The
standard timing of this decision-making is three times a week. When the ser-
vices demand it decisions can be made once every day.

The system software is based on the DOS Yes-1020 disk operating system.

[Text) New effects in the stimulated Raman scattering of light (838)
have been discovered and studied experimentally: l) reconstruction of
the divergence, brightness, amplitude and phase of exciting laser light,
and 2) the formation of s multifocus structure in an 888 bean. The

image of an object-a transparency-illuminated by an exciting laser
beam is reconstructed in stimulated Raman scattering (SR5) so that longi-
tudinal and transverse magnification obey the laws of holography. Re-
construction of the wavefront of light takes place in consequence of

the amplification of SR3 at intensity maxi-a of the exciting light and of
diffraction in absorption holograms formed by laser radiation in an an-
plifying medium. Our experiments have deaonstrated that under certain
conditions the focal structure in an SR5 beam does not destroy the effect
of reconstruction of the wavefront.

scattering matter is exceeded over a certain range of the power density of exciting
radiation in stimulated Rasan scattering (SR5). a number of physical effects arise
which were previously unknown in the Iolecular scattering of light. It has been
discovered that SR8 propagated in the direction opposite the exciting radiation-—

a three-dimensional iaage of it. obeying the laws of holography, is reconstructed
in the SRS beam. It was possible to discover the holographic nature of the pheno-
menon precisely in SR5, because of the considerable shift in the frequency of the
scattered light relative to the frequency of the exciting radiation. The amplitude

and phase characteristics of the pumping bean are reconstructed in "forward" and
backward" SR8 beams. The wavefront of "forward" SRS is similar with some degree of
accuracy to the pumping wavefront, and the wavefront of "backward" SR8 is with some
degree of accuracy "inverted" relative to the pumping wavefront. The SRS beam.
being propagated in the medium, is broken up into a number of focal regions. The
longitudinal and transverse dimensions of these focal regions are determined by the
power density of stimulated Raman scattering of light. Self-focusing of the stimu-
lated Raman scattering of light is in a number of cases the reason leading to de-
struction of the effect of reconstruction of the wavefront of light.

This article is devoted to the results of the experimental discovery and study of
these new physical effects in stimulated Raman scattering.

1. Reconstruction of Amplitude and Phase of Intense Light Waves in Stimulated
Raman Scattering

Stimulated Raman scattering of light was produced in liquid nitrogen (Av - 2300
cm_‘), a single crystal of calcite (Av - 1085 cm ‘). in carbon bisulfide (Av - 656
cm 1), piperidine (Av - 2936 cm l). acetone (Av . 2921 cm 1); nitrobenzene (Av -

- 1345 cm x); benzene (Av - 992 cm"), toluene (Av - 1003 cm 1) and cyclohexane
(Av - 882 cn 1) by means of giant pulses of a ruby and of the second harmonic of
a neodymium laser with a length of 20°10 ns-’ and 20°10 ns.u [as published].

The field of laser radiation striking the scattering medium represents the inter-
ference of the intense beam generated by the crystal and weak beams originating as
the result of the diffraction of the intense beam in parts of the apparatus (dia-
phragms, inhomogeneities of the apparatua's optical elements and the like).

If the intensity of the diffracted light is very law, then it is possible to dis-
regard the interference of these beams with the intense wave of laser radiation.
That is. it is possible to assume that in the light striking the medium only the
zeroth order of diffraction is present. i.e., light having traveled the path to the
cell without deflection. Conditions close to this case were realized in [1). SRS
was produced in liquid nitrogen by means of the giant pulse of a ruby laser. The
radiation was concentrated in the TEN mode. A practically plane laser wave with a
Gaussian distribution of intensity struck the lens and was focused onto a cell with
the scattering substance. A study was made of the dependence on the thickness of
the scattering layer and on the pumping energy of the divergence, brightness and
distribution of intensity in the long-range field of SR5 propagated in the direc-
tion of the exciting rsdiation-"forward"-and in the opposite direction--"back-
wards.”

According to the generally accepted notions, SRS originates as the result of the
amplification of pulses of Raman scattering spontaneous noise. Actually, the
experiment has demonstrated that in a thin layer of a medium, even with excitation
by means of a single-mode laser, SRS is incoherent. The brightness of SRS is much
less than the brightness. and its divergence is considerably greater than the
divergence. of the original laser radiation (cf. fig la). However, when certain
values of pumping and thickness of the layer of material are reached, the diver-
gence. distribution of intensity in the long-range field and the brightness of
"backwards" SRS and of the laser radiation become close (cf. fig lb). A

practically plane wave is reconstructed with "backward" SRS when the radiation of

a single-mode laser passes through the medium. The medium, as it were, reflects
the laser radiation "backwards" with a shift in frequency equal to the most intense
intramolecular vibration of matter. In stimulated Brillouin scattering ($88), when
the frequency of the exciting radiation is close to the frequency of the scattered
light. this phenomenon has been given the name "inversion" of the wavefront of
light [2]. Let us note that producing an inverted beam of scattered light both in
$38 and SRS does not at all require the introduction of a "phase" plate into the
exciting light bean [2]. The general nature of phenomena with SRS [l] and $38 [2]
was reported on in [3]. The reconstruction of a number of parameters of the laser
radiation in ”backward" SRS receives an explanation if attention is paid to the
nature of the distribution of pumping power density along the cell with the scatter-
ing substance in the excitation of SR5 by means of a focused light pulse with a
length of 10 9 ns (fig 2). The power density of the exciting light, I . is great-
est in the space of the medium bounded by the pumping beam near the f al point of
the lens. In these ranges even with relatively low energy of the laser's giant
pulse the power density of the exciting radiation reaches the SRS saturation level
and the distribution of intensity over the cross section of the SRS beam does not
depend on the distribution of intensity of the laser radiation. Being propagated
primarily in the space bounded by the beam of exciting radiation, with a certain
value of the gain increment, glI , SR5 becomes directional and coherent. The high
directivity and coherence of SRS are associated with the preferred amplification of
components of spontaneous noise with wave vectors parallel and antiparallel to the
pumping wave vector. It is interesting to note that the directivity of the SR8
bean becomes close to the directivity of the laser radiation with a gain increment
value of gEIo > 15 .

Experimental studies and theoretical estimates in [lo] have demonstrated that when
this value of the gain increment is reached in the medium the origin of distributed
feedback (ROS) is also possible in stimulated scattering. vhich, in turn, can be
the reason for an increase in brightness and directivity of stimulated-scattered
light. The analysis of the reasons for the origin of and of the influence of dis-
tributed feedback on the parameters of stimulated-scattered light in each specific
case is a separate problem and can be performed primarily experimntally. Repro-

pumping power density is minimal in the space of the medium adjacent to the cell's
inlet and outlet windows. The experiment demonstrates that this layer accomplishes
the transfer of information on the distribution of puwing alplitude to the SRS
bean. Reproduction of the pumping amplitude in the 8118 field does not take place
with a pumping power density near the cell's windows which reaches the level of SRS
saturation.

Experiments with the excitation of SR5 in liquid nitrogen by means of a single-mode
laser have demonstrated that with SRS a wave is reconstructed which is close to the
incident wave not only in amplitude but also in phase characteristics. However,

only subsequent experiments with reconstruction of the image in SRS made it possible
to establish the accuracy of the reproduction of amplitude and phase with SRS and
to understand sufficiently the physics of the phenomenon.

2. Reconstruction of Image in Stimulated Raman Scattering of Light

It was found in [5-9] that the introduction into a beam of laser radiation of a
three-dimensional semitransparent object is accompanied by reconstruction of its
three-dimensional-image in "forward" and "backward" SRS beams. The experimental
setup with the transparency is essentially not different from the previous setup.
The introduction into the optical circuit of a transparency with specific dimensions
of inhomogeneities makes it possible to control the relative intensity of light
beams of various orders of diffraction, which is convenient for studying the pro-
perties of the distinctive optical system discussed and for studying the nature of
reconstruction of the image with stimulated scattering.

A screen with wire 2 to 3 microns thick and cell dimensions of 600 microns was used
as the object in the experiments. with the stimulated scattering of light the
zeroth order of diffraction is reconstructed, corresponding to the laser's light
which passes through the object without deflection. and higher orders originating

as the result of diffraction of the direct laser beam at the object's edges. Let

us cover part of the SR5 beam with a nontransparent shield. In the plane of the
image reconstructed in SR5, in the part covered by the shield. outlines of the image
are visible which are constructed by beams of a higher order of diffraction propa-
gated at an angle to the optical axis (cf. fig 3). The image reconstructed with

$38 was at the same distance from the cell as the object and with SRS was shifted

and altered in transverse scale.

Scattering. The Right Half Corresponds to the Covered Stimulated
Scattering Beam.

The following experimental results prove the holographic nature of the reconstructed
image in the stimulated scattering of light. An image was reconstructed in the
stimulated-scattered beam regardless of what distance the object was from the cell;
a real image of the object, produced by means of a lens (cf. fig 4), was found
outside or inside the medium. The magnification and position of the image recon—
structed in the SRS beam were such that the minima and maxima of the interference
patterns of the pumping and "backward" SRS beam always coincided with the "inlet"
window of the cell for the laser radiation and the "outlet" for SR8. Knowing from
experimentation the position and scale of the real image of the object (d3) recon-
structed with SRS, from the lens formula it is possible to determine the position of
the corresponding virtual image (m ), representing. as it were. the source of waves
reconstructed with SRS. It is posaible to assume that the three-dimensional inter-
ference pattern of the pumping field is created by a pair of point sources, one of

128

which is in line with the focal point of the lens (1'). and the other with a random
point (C') of the real image of the object. Then with "backward" SR8 the inter-

ference pattern is created. as it were, by another pair of sources, one of which is
in line with the corresponding point (C ) of the virtual image (In ) and the posi-
tion of the other it is not cowlicatednto determine from the condition for match-
ing of the interference patterns for SR8 and pumping near the cell's outlet window.
As the experiment demonstrated, the upificstion of the image, d , is always such
that the second source of interfering SR8 waves coincides with thg focal region of
the lens. In this case the magnification, N , and the position, v , of the image,
Is , in the $38 beam is described by the simple relationships: s

The relationships gotten for magnification of the image reconstructed in the SR5
beam agree with the expression familiar in holography for reconstructing an image
by means of a plane hologram with coinciding sources of reference and reconstructed
waves. Shifting the cell along the optical axis of the system relative to the
three-dimensional interference pattern for pumping results in a change in the posi-
tion of intensity minim and maxima in the plane of the cell's outlet window. The
magnification and the position of the image reconstructed with stimulated scatter-

ing changed accordingly, obeying equation (1).

The experimental relationships receive an explanation if the distribution of the
power density of the exciting light inside the scattering space is taken into

129

account (cf. fig 3). SRS is excited chiefly at the focal point of the lens in the
region of the zero component of the tourier spectrum of the object exposed to the
laser radiation. The majority of the energy (approximately 80 percent) of the laser
radiation is concentrated in this region. The remainder of the energy (approxi-
mately 20 percent) falls to the share of higher—order harmonics which construct in
the image plane the outlines of the screen. If the pumping power density is great
and the medium is sufficiently optically homogeneous, only the outlines of the
screen remain in the image plane at the pumping wavelength. The intense zeroth
order is absent because of its conversion into SR3.

Higher-order harmonics which are weak in intensity are not converted into SR5.
higher-order harmonics appear in the spectrum of the reconstructed image with SRS
as the result of the diffraction of SRS light in amplifying absorption holograms
recorded in the medium as the result of the modulation of amplification by the
pumping field near the windows of the cell, where the power density of the exciting
radiation is lower than the amplification saturation level. The effect of recon-
struction of the image hi the SBS beam disappears with saturation of amplification
in these layers.

The thickness of the layer of effective diffraction and the energy range for the
existence of effects depend on a number of causes. The degree of optical inhomo-
geneity of the medium has important value in addition to saturation of amplifica-
tion. An experimental comparison was made of the thickness of layers of effective
diffraction in media differing considerably in degree of optical inhomogeneity:

in a single crystal of calcite (of the "extra" grade for Glan prisms), cooled to
the temperature of liquid nitrogen, and in liquid nitrogen.

An experimental comparison of the localization in space and of the magnification of
an image reconstructed with SRS made it possible to establish that in a medium with
a high degree of optical homogeneity (a single crystal of calcite) the thickness of
the layer of effective diffraction (10 to 15 cm) is considerably greater than the
thickness of the layer of effective diffraction in liquid nitrogen (2 to S cm) under
the same experimental conditions. In a medium with a high degree of optical homo-
geneity reconstruction of the wavefront of light takes place both in the "forward"
and in the "backward" direction, in close energy ranges. In a medium which is
essentially optically inhomogeneous (liquid nitrogen) reconstruction of the wave-
front of light by "forward" SRS takes place over a pumping energy range which is
considerably narrower than in calcite and than with "backward" SR8 in liquid
nitrogen. "hen light passes through an optically inhomogeneous medium the SRS and
pumping wavefront are considerably distorted because of scattering in inhomogenei-
ties.

Reconstruction takes place fairly effectively with "backward" SRS. On one hand,
the pumping interference field is not yet distorted near the inlet window as a
consequence of conversion of the light into stimulated scattering, and on the other
at a certain depth of the medium the amplification of SR8 at pumping intensity
maxima with counter beans, with propagation of SRS "backward" toward the inlet
window, compensates pumping distortions.

3. "Inversion" of Wavefront of Light in Stimlated Ramon Scattering

Experience has shown that under certain conditions (thickness of the layer, illumi-
nation. sufficient optical homogeneity of the medium) the phenomenon of reconstruc-
tion of the wavefront of light takes place with "forward" and "backward" SR5.

The wavefront of "forward" SIS with a certain degree of accuracy reproduces the.
wavefront of the laser radiation striking the medium. The wavefront of "backward"
$33 is "inverted" also with some degree of accuracy (complex conjugate) relative to
the wavefront of the exciting laser,radiation striking the cell with the scattering
substance. It is possible to observe the orientation of wavefronts with "forward"
and "backward” $88 if an asymmetric object is placed in the beam of exciting laser
radiation (cf. fig 4). It is obvious from this figure that the image reconstructed
in a “forward" SRS beam is oriented the same as the real image of the object in the
pumping beam obtained by means of the lens focusing the laser radiation on the
substance. The "reflection" from the medium differs radically from reflection from
an ordinary plane mirror, but is similar to reflection from a holographic mirror
[10] (cf. fig 4). when laser radiation is aimed at the cell with the substance,
then the laser excites SRS "backward" so that the exciting incident beam and the
"reflected" almost coincide. In the plane of the image reconstructed with SRS in
reflection from the cell's window, amplitude modulation is observed corresponding
to a virtual inverted image of the object. In "reflection" from the medium the
real image is reconstructed, oriented precisely the same as the object. That is,
the wavefront with "backward" SRS is with a certain degree of accuracy the complex
conjugate of the incident wavefront. Nevertheless, the difference in scale and the
mismatch in space of the SRS and pumping wavefront depend quite considerably also
on the difference in wavelengths of the exciting and scattered light and on a
number of other factors. In this connection, the usual methods of analyzing fronts
by means of a phase element, employed in dynamic holography [11], are not applicable
to SR8. For example, when a.glass plate etched in hydrofluoric acid is positioned
near the lens its image in the SR8 beam is shifted by S to 10 cm for the media
studied. The obtainment under these conditions of data on SRS identical to data on
838 [12] testifies to the unsuitability of this procedure for studying reconstruc-
tion of the wavefront with SR3. In particular, by employing the procedure in (12]
it is impossible to discover the holographic nature of the phenomenon and to de-
‘termine the difference between the SR5 wavefront and the pumping wavefront. The
distinctive orientation of the image in "reflection" from the medium can be used

as a convenient method of separating scattered light from that reflected from the
windows of the cell with the substance or from the faces of the crystal. This
method is especially convenient with a slight shift in the frequency of scattered
light (888, SR5) relative to the exciting light.

It is possible to draw a conclusion regarding the degree of reproduction of the
wavefront of the light in stimulated scattering on the basis of analyzing the
parameters (magnification and contrast) of the image reconstructed in SR8.

Experience has shown that the degree of accuracy of reproduction of the wavefront
depends both on the parameters of the medium (dielectric constant and optical homo-
geneity) and on excitation conditions (thickness of the medium's layer, pumping
energy, illumination configuration. pulse length). for example, since the contrast
of the interference pattern in the medium depends nonlinearly on the pumping power,

1 1
FOR 0W11C1£&.USEGDNLY
I-OIC OFFICIAL 03!. ONLY

then the contrast of the image in the $83 beam varies with the pumping power densi-
ty. "hen SRS was excited by means of a pulse of nanosecond length [13] in a layer
of cyclohexane of uniform thickness, a change in power from 15 to 50 FIN/cm2 resulted
in a change in contrast and the magnification of the image reconstructed in $88
changed threefold. In a word, optimum experinental conditions exist under which
reconstruction of the wavefront of light with SR3 is shown to be most complete.

A necessary condition for this reconstruction, as demonstrated experimentally, is
the existence of directed seroth-order diffraction (close in terms of directivity
to the laser radiation) and the presence in the medium of a layer playing the role
of a dynamic hologram. Of interest for practical applications is not only total
reconstruction of the wavefront, but also the ability to filter frequencies in the
object's spectrum by methods of nonlinear optics. Realization of this filtering is
possible in principle with the reconstruction of wavefronts of light in media which
are active in stimulated scattering.

In this study a qualitative model of the phenomenon of reconstruction of the wave-
front of light with SRS is discussed, making it possible to explain all the key
relationships observed experimentally. At the present time theoretical studies
exist [14-17] in which several aspects of the reconstruction phenomenon are ex-
plained, but a number of certain important experimental factors contradict the ex-
planations suggested. For example, in [13] the mode theory of volume holograms,
developed in [17], is used to explain reconstruction of a wavefront with SRS.
According to [13] the reconstruction effect can be observed with a shift in the
frequency of the scattered light no greater than 2000 cm ‘. In experiments recon-
struction is observed with considerably greater frequency shifts and the experi-
mental limit of the shift with which reconstruction takes place has yet to be
reached. The feature of the distribution of illumination within the medium in the
excitation of $88 under superluminoua emittance conditions simultaneously with the
saturation effect has also not been taken into account in a single theoretical
study.

It must be mentioned that in principle the wavefront of light can be recorded by the
recording in a medium, active in $35, of nixed amplitude-phase holograms. Record-
ing can involve not only modulation of amplification, but also the change in the
real part of the dielectric constant, i.e., the refractive index [7, 18]. The
refractive index can vary under the influence of laser radiation on account of the
high-Q Kerr effect, electrostriction, a change in the polarizability of molecules
during excitation, etc. Essentially the same causes result in another effect-the
self-focusing of light.

6. Self-Focusing of Stimulated Raman Scattered Light

Experimental studies of a wide range of substances with various optical character-
istics and probabilities of Raman scattering of light have demonstrated that the
pattern of the development of self-focusing of light observed in media with a large
effective Raman scattering cross section differs radically from the generally ac-
cepted ideas.

In media with a large effective Raman scattering cross section the power density of
radiation required for reaching the self-focusing threshold is achieved consider-
ably sooner in the 835 beam than in the beam of exciting laser radiation [1, 19].

132
FOR OFFICIAL use ONLY
This occurs as a consequence of two main causes: 1) the exponential law for the
amplification of SR8 results in reduction of the diameter of the $25 beam and in
an increase in its brightness and coherence in propagation in the space bounded by
the pumping beam with a distribution of intensity which diminishes from the center
to the edges; 2) the power of the exciting laser radiation decreases first of all
in regions of maximum intensity when it is converted into 885. The conversion
factors can reach 60 to 70 percent. In this connection, the power required for
self-focusing is reached sooner in the SRS beam than in the laser radiation beam.

Self-focusing in the SRS and laser radiation beams develops independently, separate-
ly from one another [20, 21]. Self-focusing conditions (the number and dimensions
of focal regions) in the SRS beam depend solely on the power of the laser radiation
converted into SRS [3, 21].

The experimental results cited could not be explained on the basis of ideas regard-
ing the excitation and propagation of SRS in threads of self-focusing of laser
light. The new multifocal pattern of the propagation of light beams in media with
Kerr nonlinearity suggested in [22, 26] eliminated a great number of contradictions
between theory and experimental results [23]. According to [22, 26], with high
conversion factors, because of the coherence of the SRS beam, an independent focal
structure forms in it, independent of the multifocal structure of the exciting radi-
ation. Aspects of the angular spectral and time distribution of the intensity of
SRS under conditions when the main 585 energy is concentrated in regions of the
self-focusing of SRS light found an explanation. An explanation was found for the
experimental result to the effect that with an increase in 835 power focal regions
in beams of 535 components, representing the vertices of radiation cones, and of
higher-order Stokes and anti-Stokes components, draw near the outlet window of the
cell, whereby the opening of the cones increases smoothly right up to values ex-
ceeding angles of the Cerenkov type [20].

5. Conclusion

The results of studies have shown that substances which are active in stimulated
Ramsn scattering can be divided into three groups [3]. Group A: substances with

a high Kerr constant (K N 20 C683 units), high gain (g_ N 1 HWIcm ) and a high

ratio of SRS energy under saturation to the energy of the laser radiation (8 [EO-

= 10 ‘). Group B: K is close to zero, g N 0.1 HH/cm and E ’20— N 10.l .8

Group C: substances with a low Kerr_ constant of K N 10 CGSE ugits— , and values

of g N 0.01 HH/cm2 and E [30— W 10-2 to 10 ‘ . Substance of types A and 8. having
high values of g and B [30 , in spite of the great difference in Kerr constants,
have common properties. ocal regions measuring 10 microns are observed in an SRS
beam with its maximum intensity. Characteristic of these substances is a sudden
change in intensity when a certain value of the gain increment is reached. However,
a great number of properties are different for substances of types A and 8. Their
Kerr constants differ markedly, the power density and total energy concentrated in
focal regions of minimum diameter are much less in substances of type B, and the
ratio of SR8 thresholds for exciting radiation with circular and linear polariza-
tion is different. The identical small-scale focal structure of SRS in substances
of types A and B and, at the same time, considerable differences in a number of
important properties, make it possible to suggest that the key mechanisms responsi-
ble for a change in the real part of polarizability in media of these types can be

133

different. The theoretical estimates in [25] and comparisons with experimental
data in media with low Kerr constants give results in favor of a mechanism in-
volving a change in the polarizability of molecules during excitation [19, 26].

In substances of type C self—focusing points 10 microns in diameter originate.

The manifestation of a small-scale focal structure in the SRS beam is character-
istic of substances with a high value of the factor for the conversion of laser
radiation into 535. In media of group A, where the concentration of intensity in
self-focusing regions is especially high, the multifocal structure in the SRS beam
destroys the effect of reconstruction of the wavefront of light in SR8. The
effect exists only over a small energy range. If with the same value of E [E

the gain is not very high, the energy range for the existence of reconstrucgion is
expanded. Reconstruction of the wavefront with stimulated scattering is observed
over a considerably broader excitation energy range in media of groups B and C than
in media of group A.

Thus, optimum values exist for the gain of the conversion of light into SRS and

for values of the nonlinear contribution to the refractive index with which the
effect of reconstruction of the wavefront is observed over a breed energy range and
the self-focusing of light does not destroy the reconstruction. The relationships
gotten for stimulated Raman scattering are of a general nature and are valid for
any nonlinearly amplifying media.

[Text] An analysis is made of the limiting characteristics of
the accuracy of solving primal and inverse problems of digital
holography. The relationship between the limiting accuracy of
reconstructing the parameters of an object and the character-
istics of the recording and hologram digital processing sys-
tems is established. Analytical expressions and numerical
estimates are obtained for the limiting accuracy of the re—
production of wavefronts as a function of errors in the digi-
tal representation of holograms on a computer.

1. Introduction

Digital holography in the last 10 years has attracted the attention of an ever
greater number of investigators-physicists, mathematicians and engineers. A number
of generalizing surveys have appeared [1, 2] and a monograph [3] reflecting the
state of the art of the problem of analyzing and synthesizing wave fields on a com-
puter. But hitherto estimates of the practical capabilities of digital holography
have been very contradictory. Optimists (among which the authors of this article
are numbered) believe that digital holography in combination with physical will make
it possible to solve a number of important scientific and applied problems from the
number of "insoluble" ones. Skeptics not without justification point to the quite
modest practical successes of modern digital holography and express doubts about
their possible growth. In this situation the decisive role belongs to the theory of
digital holography, but its creation has encountered a number of fundamental diffiv
culties associated primarily with the need to change from qualitative estimates--
"worse" or "better"--to quantitative criteria for comparing the various methods of
analyzing and synthesizing holograms on a computer, as well as with the need to

136

establish some limiting values for these criteria. Clearly realizing the hopeless-
ness of attempting to construct a general theory of digital holography at the
present time, the authors have attempted. nevertheless, in this article, having
narrowed the class of problems discussed, to introduce the required quantitative
criteria and to establish their limiting values. It was possible to conduct an
investigation of the limiting characteristics of the accuracy of synthesizing holo-
grams on a computer (the primal problem of digital holography) for problems of
testing optical surfaces and the spatial filtering of optical fields. The dis-
cussion carried out made it possible to indicate the limits of the parameters of
wavefronts permitting synthesis by umthods of digital holography. An investigation
of the limiting characteristics of the accuracy of reconstructing images and of
their parameters (the inverse problem of digital holography) was performed for
Fresnel-Fraunhofer holograms and holograms of phase objects.

2. Limits of the Possible for Holograms Synthesized on a Computer

Even the first investigators [4] discovered that an image reconstructed from a
computer hologram is of rather poor quality, sometimes even little like its mathe-
matical description. To understand the reasons for these distressing results, it is
necessary to discuss in greater detail the process of producing a computer hologram.
Here we will consider errors specific only to computer holograms per se, without
taking into account the influence of the recording medium and other factors which
appear in physical holograms also. Let it be required to roduce a hologram with
an amplitude transmission function of “(u, v) , where IuT g d/2 and IV] §.d/2
(where d is the dimension of the hologram).

Only N x N samples of the hologram are stored in the computer,

Em" Q.[W(un,‘l£.)] ', n,m- l.-N, (1)
obtained from the "mathematical" hologram, "(u, v) , by sampling with an interval
of 6 and by quantizing with H levels (Q denotes the sample quantization opera-
tion). Let us note that quantity 6 is t e resolution of a computer hologram.

Quantities {P ; n,m - l:ﬁ} are supplied in the form of electrical signals to

a hologram recgrding unit which exposes to light N x N cells on the surface of a
light-sensitive medium with an exposure determined by the individual sample. or
which modulates a beam of coherent light. Sampling appears to be a completely
"legitimate" operation in view of the familiar sampling theorem. However, this is
true only at first glance. In reality sampling operations result in the manifesta-
tion of basic differences between computer holograms and physical holograms and
considerably restrict the class of "realizable" wavefronts which can be reconstructed

from computer holograms with errors acceptable for practical applications.

It is generally not possible to indicate the class of realizable wavefronts. How-
ever, there is a broad class of problems in which a wavefront reconstructed from a
synthesized hologram is used for quantitative measurements and optical computations.
This class includes the optical spatial filtering of an image, the testing of optical
systems by means of synthesized holograms and a number of other problems. Present

in explicit form in these problems is not only the mathematically assigned structure

and form of the wavefront which must be produced, but also a quantitative criterion
for the accuracy in producing it.

Let us consider the problem of producing a reference aspherical wavefront. 0 (cf.
fig 1). Let the hologram, P , be synthesized so that when it is exposed to beam

The use of computers linked by means of recording units in principle opens up the
possibility of implementing complex basis functions in the form of a set of syn-
thesized spatial filters. However, the above—named sampling errors in the synthesis
of filters on a computer result in "perturbed" basis functions, ‘9 (x,y) - 1: (my) .
and in errors in computing coefficients, i.e., actually instead of (11) "pefturbed"
coefficients are cmuted:

coefficients c will differ so such from that it will be necessary to refrain
from using spattal filters synthesized on a c uter. It is possible to choose as

spectrum analysis by means of these filters. i.e.. the value, 6" , of the standard
deviation from the iumge, £(x,y) , of a segment of I. first terms of its orthogonal
expansion. Let us note that error 22 is determined not by a single hologram, but
by an entire set of 1. spatial filters. The maxim permissible minimum value of
error 62 is made possible by means of an optimum Karunen-Loew basis. In [5] it is

3. Limits of Accuracy of Reconstruction of Parameters e! an Object from a Hologram

A holographic experiment makes it possible to record complex fields and to recon—
struct an object. In the final analysis investigators are interested either in the
parameters of the studied object (e.g., the geometrical dimensions and coordinates
of parts of the image), or in the image of the object per as. We know [6] that at
the stages of recording and reconstructing the hologram accidental distortions
originate which reduce the accuracy of measuring the parameters of the image. In
information theory methods are known which make it possible to estimate the limiting
accuracy of the reconstruction of parameters for certain observation models [7. 8].
Therefore. the problem arises of developing models for the observation of signals
corresponding to various arrangements of the holographic process.

In estimating the accuracy of measuring parameter s of the holographic image we
will use the mean square error

' a a

where E is the averaging operator and (8 - a) is the error in measuring the
parameter.

In [11] a method is described for measuring the mean velocity of particles from an

ture which for a unidimensional Gaussian distribution of velocities has the form:

[Text] The integrated circuits of high-speed digital-analog and analog-digital
converters are applied in digital television. digital vidsorecording. digital

processing of radar signals, digital communications systems, and in measuring
and telemetric devices.

At the present time work on digital-analog and analog-digital converters is pro-
gressing in the following areas:

1. Broadening the functional capabilities of the information systems of digital-
analog convertors (nAC's) and analog-digital convertors (Abe's) by increasing
their circuit and design complexity and including in than sources of reference
quantities, operations amplifiers, digital interlinking circuits, and the like.
In this case the number of components on a chip increases from 150-200 to 5,000-
20,000 and more.

2. Increasing the precision and resolution of conversion to 14-16 bits for
DAC's and 8-10 bits for ABC's with a simultaneous decrease in power consumed per
hit.

3. Increasing the speed from hundreds of kiloherts to hundreds of megahertz.

4. Improving temperature stability to 10"6 1/degree in the temperature range
from -60 to +125 degrees C.

The distinguishing features of the development of integrated DAC and ABC cir-
cuits in comparison with digital circuits are the following:

1. The large assortment of types of components, including n-p—n and p-n-p
transfers and lateral transistors. diodes, stabilitrons, and solid state and film
resistors; this makes the fabrication of integrated circuits in a single indus-
trial cycle more complex.

15b
we omcw. use ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

2. The irregular structure of the schematic electrical diagram, which makes it
more difficult to formalise the structure of fabrication topology and to monitor

the microcircuits.

3. Heightened requirements for the parameters and spread of parameters of the
components and for the temperature and tile stability of the input and output
characteristics of the integrated circuits (for example, the relative error of
resistors for the 12-bit S96PA1 use should be no more than 0.01 percent and the
temperature stability of the output current should be 3-10"6 l/degree.)

6. Two-three times as many monitored parameters in the production cycle. final
monitoring, and testing, and also high requirements for the precision of the
monitoring and testing apparatus.

5. Special conditions for measurement and testing of electrical characteristics
(such as the shielding of the space, the presence of a separate grounding line
and special power supply sources, and so on).

In the fabrication of high-speed. highly complex DAC and ADC integrated circuits
three-diffusion bipolar technology is widely used. In this case only five photo-
lithographs are required to fabricate microcircuits on P-type silicon substrates
without an epitaxial layer. Hicrocircuits made using this technology can oper-
ate at frequencies of 30-500 megahertz. This technology makes it possible to
obtain a high percentage of usable highly integrated bipolar circuits that con-
tain 20,000-00,000 components per chip. The active components fabricated by
bipolar technology have a boundary frequency of about five gigabertz. There-
fore, to support a speed of more than 100 megahertz for the DAC and ADC cir-
cuits it is necessary to use a more advanced technological base, for example
gallium arsenide.

Table 1 below gives the parameters of certain types of domestically produced
microelectronic circuits of assenblies for DAC's and ADC's and also of DAC and
ADC integrated circuits. Table 2 below shows the parameters of advanced types
of DAC and ADC integrated circuits.

The principal problems that arise during the fabrication of integrated DAC and
ADC circuits are the following:

1. Fabrication of defect-free precision photo teaplates for obtaining convertor
structures on a 7 x 7 millimeter chip with around 20,000 cowonents. The size
of the minimum element on the photo template here is 1.5 microns with a toler-
ance of 20.1 microns, and the number of defective nodules does not exceed five

percent. It is essential to incorporate the latest optical-nechanical equip-
ment to fabricate such tteates.

2. Monitoring technical parameters in the process of fabricating converter
structures on a card during the operations of alloying and photolithography for
the purpose of insuring the assigned electrical parameters in the components.

3. Measurement of the parameters of high-speed DAc's and ADC's on a plate and
during final nonitoring. The difficulties of measuring parameters arise from
the requirements for high precision and great speed. as well as the very high
values of the parameters. For example, measuring set-up time for the output
current of a NC at 50 nilliamps with a precision of 0.05 percent and a speed of
10-20 nanoseconds requires highly precise coordination of the parameters of the
devices in the measurement channel. oscillographs with sensitivity of 0.5-1.0
nillivolts per centimeter and a range up to 500 megahertz, and appropriate oper-
ating amplifiers, comparators. and limiters.

Aperture time of parallel ADC'e in the 10-30 nanosecond range and aperture
tremor up to 10 nanoseconds should be measured with a precision of :10 percent,
which takes the absolute error of measurement fractions of a nanosecond or pico-
second.

The measurement of differential phase, the differential mlification factor,
and parameters that describe the signal-noise ratio (noise. power output, and
ratio of the mean quadratic value of the signal to the mean quadratic value of
noise) is very complex.

At the present time, therefore, we must step up the development of monitoring
and measurement equipment for monitoring the parameters of high-speed DAC's and
ADC's. This equipment should be able to work under shop conditions. He must
also develop standard measurement methodologies.

[Excerpts] One way to improve the precision and metrological reliability of
microelectronic analog-digital converters [ABC's] is automatic correction of the
transfer characteristic of the converter. Until recently realization of the
known methods of correction was accorplished in the ADC by hardware means, that
is, special devices that perform all the necessary operations to correct ADC
errors were included in the structure of the converter. The development of micro-
electronic engineering and the appearance of reliable, inexpensive microprocessors
and microcomputers now makes it possible to solve the problem of error correction
in ADC's by program means.

The present article uses concrete examples to consider correction by micro-
processor of errors in the bias, conductance, and nonlinearity of microelectronic
ADC's designed to process instantaneous signal values. Without stopping to ana-
lyze already known methods of correction (the auxiliary measurements method.

the inverse conversion method, and the sample signal method) [1-6]. we will only
point out that in our case we have selected the sample signal method as the cor-
rection method [3] because it is simpler and more efficient than the auxiliary
measurements method and, unlike the iterative method of inverse conversions [6],
it does not require an increase in conversion time (which is undesirable in an
ADC for processing instantaneous signal values). The essential feature of the
sample signal method is that a source of sample signals is switched onto the in-
put of the ADC through a multichannel commutator in the intervals between con-
versions of the signals under study. The microprocessor at the output of the
ADC, relying on the results of coding of sample signals. determines the devia-
tion of the transfer characteristics of the converter from the required figure
and puts the correction in the digital code of the signal under study.

To preclude bias error it is sufficient to perform a computation by the formula
“K - “x " No, (1)

where N‘ and "K are the code of the number before and after correction re-

spectively, and "o is the code of the smle signal, equal in the given case to
zero.

Cowutation of the coefficient K is done by the microprocessor (series K580 inte-
grated circuits) for 500 microseconds at a cycle frequency of two megahertz and

with an eight-bit output ADC code (the code “K is determined in 300 microseconds).
Thus. the total time to correct an ADC conductance error, including time to con-
vert the sample signal, exceeds 800 microseconds. We should observe that con-
version of the sample signal and computation of the coefficient K for correcting
the conductance error of a microelectronic ADC should not be done more often than
calibration of contelporary digital voltmeters. Por this reason, the correction
time for this error can be evaluated only by the time of performance of the oper-
ation of multiplying the coefficient K by the code N1, which is 300 microseconds.

Conclusions. Digital correction of error makes it possible to improve the pre-
cision and metrological reliability of microelectronic ADC's, and to avoid the
need to calibrate them, which is made difficult by the limited number or com-
plete lack of built-in elements in such ADC's. The usefulness of digital correc—
tion is especially apparent in analog processors of the Intel 2920 type [9].
which instead of ABC's and DAC's contain a microprocessor set and are built in
the form of one microcircuit.

2. because of the low speed of conteworary microprocessors. digital correction
in highly productive ADC's is still not efficient. The use of digital correc-

tion in such ADC's is advisable when the cycle frequency of the nicroprocessor
is 100 megahertz and higher.

3. Debugging the correction programs and calculating their execution time for
the series K580 microprocessor set was done by means of a cross-system (developed
at the Kiev Polytechnic Institute) which takes it possible to model the work

of microcomputers on the basis of Yes [Unified System] couputers.

USE OF ODA-ZOH UNIT FOR AUTOMATIC DATA TRANSMISSION

Kiev PRBOBRAZOVATBLI FORM! INPORHATSII I SREDSTVA PBREDACBI DANNYKH in Russian
1981 (signed to press 21 Apr 81) pp 45-51

Equipment" edited by Doctor of technical sciences A. I. Kondslav, Ordena Lenina
Institut kibernetiki, 600 copies. 89 pages]

[Text] The ODA-ZOH system was developed for data transmission on multistation
communications channels (acc'a). Radio or wire channels may be used as HCC's
when subscribers are connected to a multistation system. It is common knowledge
that Hcc's are most economical for data transmission, even though their use in-
volves a number of difficulties in organizing priority control. The use of
programmable supervisors based on microprocessors makes this problem much
easier.

Hork on Hcc's is based on the fact that all station data transmission devices
are connected to the common channel in the same way. can carry out various pro-
cedures to process data and prepare it for transmission independently. and are
always in a duty reception mode. This is accomplished by the fact that the re-
ceiving block of the modem in its initial state is connected to the communications
channel and its priority for exchanging data on the internal pipeline is set as
highest. As soon as any station begins transmitting data, all other stations
establish synchronization with the transmitting station and check the affiliation
of the data. The addressee station receives the data, checks it. and sends a
response-receipt; the other stations continue execution of interrupted jobs un-
til the next transmission. -

The switching of a station in the data transmission regiae is done when the
channel is not occupied (channel state analyzer - CSA) under the control of the
priority system, whose jobs include eliminating conflict situations (the compe-
tition regime) and insuring assigned service parameters for all stations. In
physical terms, priority control is realized by setting various delay quantities
upon whose expiration stations are given the right to transmit on the channel
the next time it is free.

The ODA—ZOH system has adopted the following package format. First the charac-
ters SBIT are transmitted to tune the receiving units to the selected transmission

160
FOR‘OFF"JAI.USE(NVLY
speed. Then follow the characters SYN. the title (exchange protocol). and the
message itself. The last thing transmitted is error check hits. After the last
character has been transmitted the transmitting station switches off the chan-
nel. 0n the receiving end.the loss of a carrying signal is taken as a sign

that the transmission is completed.

The title occupies a fixed number of bytes (16) and is used as an escort receipt

to the package of data being transmitted and also as a responding receipt issued
by the receiving station when it receives and checks the data received.

The title contains information on the addresses of the receiving and transmitting
points, the sources and receivers of data, information on transmission condi-
tions, the nature of the data, the technique for protection against errors. the
priority system. and so on. when a response receipt is transmitted the service
characters SBIT and SYN are also transmitted first. Then the receipt is trans-
mitted, with contents similar to the title of the package. Information on the
quality of reception (failure. errors, or without errors) is given in a special
byte (the eighth) in this case. Unlike the title of the package. in the re-
sponse receipt the package length. given in bytes 7 and 6 is equal to zero.

Let us look at the work of the system in sequence in the receiving and trans-
mitting modes. There are two types of modems that can be connected to the
internal pipeline: the high-speed channel (BSC) modem and the low-frequency
channel (LPC) modem. The 880 modem works with the microprocessor as an ordinary
computing unit, using standard internal pipeline signals and parallel eight-bit
representation of data for this purpose. The functions of establishing synchron-
ization, decoding the address, and shaping the characters are performed by
hardware in the modem itself. The LFC modem performs only the functions of
shaping the channel signal under control of the microprocessor, switching the
channel from the reception mode to the transmission mode, and identifying moments
of passage by the zero level according to the signal being received. All the
other functions are performed by microcomputer software. For this reason LSC
modems can only be used for physical modeling of signal modulation and demodu-
lation during data transmission. It is advisable to use it when the ODA-ZOH
apparatus is connected to data transmission systems which use series-produced
data transmission equipment. For example. when data is transmitted by biopulse
signal (or onsetime relative phase modulation) 100-150 microseconds of working
time of a 5801K80 type microprocessor is used for one bit of information. which
limits the rate of transmission to 7-10 kilobits per second.

Figure 1 below shows a block diagram of the algorithm for data processing in the
receiving mode foran HSC modem. The modem tunes itself to hit synchronization
with the channel signal according to the SBIT characters. Then the characters
by which cyclical synchronization is established are received. The first char-
acter, which differs from SYN. is received as the address of the reception
station or the sign of a circular message. If the batch of data (or responding
notice) is addressed to a particular station, the work of the microprocessor is
interrupted and the batch is received in internal memory. The characters are
counted and check sequences are formed in parallel. Then the error check sub-

routine is connected in. The check sequences that are transmitted are compared

with those received on the spot. Then a responding notice is formed and sent to
the transmission station. If no errors are found. the receiving station begins
executing instructions contained in the title of the package. If there are errors
a universal snitch transfers control to the background program interrupted

(number of repetitions. change in speed, breaking down the message, and the

like).

interrupt is removed and it returns to the Background program. Other requests

for transmission at the particular station are held up until notice is received
confirming reception. This restriction is necessary because a new request for

transmission may spoil information in the “old" batch which must be transmitted
again in case of incorrect reception.

Priority control over access to the communications channel is necessary to
avoid conflicts between stations performing data transmission procedures.

Because this system does not provide for querying the states of the stations or
centralized control of access to the channel, control functions are performed
autonomously at each station. Different control disciplines can be established
in this case, for example station priorities that are fixed or vary according to
a certain law, in dependence on overall channel traffic, permissible waiting
time, length of the queue of batches, and so on. The exchange protocol indi-
cates the particular nature of channel control discipline. In data exchange
systems where control adaptation is required, none of the stations is given
arbiter functions. This station records all batches transmitted on the channel,
determines the load of the stations, and periodically transmits circular
batches that contain new instructions on priority control.

Physical realization of different priority levels is accomplished by a priority
control block which issues authorization for transmission to the particular
station within a certain time after the commmnications channel becomes free.
This delay is proportional to the priority level. Thus, a station which has a
higher level of priority receives authorization to transmit and occupy the
channel.

In conclusion it should be noted that the advantages of the programmable ooh-20s
equipment are seen most vividly where there must be adaptive control of priority
access. rate of transmission, and various other hardware functions depending on

the current state of the system.

[Text] The development of data transmission hardware is determined in large part
by the fast-growing needs of all areas of human activity for integrated, dis-
tributed data processing systems. In recent times data transmission networks
for both general use and special purposes have become widespread. They are
constructed on different principles using wire, ground, and satellite radio
channels. As these systems become more complex, the requirements for data
transmission equipment grow and broaden substantially. The significant dif-
ferences in scope of data transmission systems (local and global), in types of
communications channels and terminal equipment used, and in other aspects have
led recently to the development and production of a broad assortment of data
transmission equipment, but it is still not always adequate because of the
rapid modernization of components of data processing systems and the different
types of problems.

For this reason the attention of data transmission equipment developers is
turning to programmable data transmission hardware which is easily adapted to
the application conditions and is therefore more universal and economical.

A definite advance in this area was seen with the appearance of microprocessor
LSIC's. which made it possible not only to increase the universality and flexi-
bility of data transmission equipment, but also to make it much cheaper than
equipment based on hardware logic. At the same time, the use of microprocessors
permitted a significant improvement in the intellect of data transmission equip-
ment, assigning to it many functions traditionally performed by channel super-
visors, concentrators, and linked computers; in numerous cases they were also
given the functions of the computers at subscriber points and terminal complexes.

Therefore, this area of work is pursuing the objective of building integrated
hardware for distributed data processing in which the functions of data collec-
tion, processing. and transmission are interrelated and realized by means of
uniform hardware.

One of the most widespread nethods in data transmission engineering is using a
microprocessor as the communications channel supervisor. In this case the
microprocessor is given the following functions: compacting data; control of
input-output; storage and shaping of data; conversion of codes; organisation of
exchange protocols and their processing; detection and correction of errors;
control of priority discipline for channel use; communication with numerous
subscribers; synchronization, and others.

Many types of data transmission equipment have already been built with analogous
schematic diagrams. For example, the batch communications system Based on the
IMP-16 microprocessor (England), the Hodbus system from the Gould Incorporated
company which works with a l 8085 microprocessor (United States), developments
from the Allen Bradley Company, Texas Instruments, and others.

The ODA-ZOH is one of the first domestically produced developments based on
program-controlled data transmission. Use of a microprocessor control system
opens broad opportunities for matching the technical specifications of the data
transmission equipment with the concrete requirements that arise when setting
up systems to automate scientific experiments.

The proposed control system has a pipeline structure. Interaction among func-
tional blocks of the system, that is, among the central processor, memory
unit, control and indicator console, modem, and input-output units is carried
on through a "Common Line" interface.

The central processor is based on a K580IK80 microprocessor using series K155
nicrocircuits.

The memory unit is a semiconductor internal memory with random access and a
semiconductor read-only memory. The memory unit uses K565 R01 and K565RYe4
microcircuits. Minimum capacity is 3-4 kilobytes. Modular enlargement of
the memory unit is possible.

The universal control console enables the operator to control the processes of
data receiving, transmitting, and processing. The characteristics of the
proposed system (the characteristics of the lhimd computer and data transmission
equipment) are taken into account in the control console. It has means for de-
bugging the control system. The control and indicator elements enable the
operator to carry on operational monitoring during the work of the system based
on such features as the address of the subscriber, the number of the exchange
protocol, the level of priority access to the comon comunications channel, the
state of the subscriber stations, the state of the communications channel, and
others. The operator accomplishes all this by pressing function keys. In the
same way the operator is able, when necessary, to modify these exchange features.
At the same time. the control and indication elements support work with the
processor part of the equipment as a conventional microcomputer. For this

purpose there is also the possibility of connecting input-output units such as
a photoresder, punched card unit, electric typewriter, nngnetic card, and so on.
to the onA-ZOH equip-eat.

The progrsn structure adopted in this system for the processes of controlling
transmission snd receiving and date processing insures nexinun system flexi-
bility and notes it possible to use the DOA-20H equipsent as dste transmission
equip-eat, as a linked processor, and es s stetion nicroconputer vith the possi-
bility of significantly enlsrging neuory cspscity and the overall productivity

HUNGARIAN commas AT BUMPEST PAIR
Moscow PRIBORY I sxsmm UPRAVLENIYA in Russian “0 3, Mar 82 pp 46-47
[Article by D. Chani and M. 'not, Hungary]

[Text] An international fair exhibiting computer equipment is held in May of every

year in Budapest. Hungarian and other foreign companies have shown their most
recent resources and systems in the central pavilion of the exhibition. This year

the systems that were shown were based mainly on microprocessors. 'lhis article
primarily examines new equipment from Hungarian plants and institutes.

Videoton Products

Videoton exhibited several systems at the fair. Included among them are a data
collection system based on the Yes-1010M computer, designed cooperatively by
specialists of Videoton and IGV enterprises and intended for use in department
stores. The central couputer can be connected to 8P16 cash register terminals
equipped with a photoelectric reader. These terminals can be located up to 1.5 km
away from the computer (without a modem).

Possible applications of the Yes-1011 system were demonstrated. The AVI'l‘ system is
a modular system for motor vehicle service enterprises. Despite the fact that its
main function is to swport the servicing of motor vehicles, the system can also
be used by various service-rendering enterprises. Data are prepared by a DH: data
base maintenance system. Information is entered into the system from terminals
separated from each other and from the central computer. Another application of
the Yes-1011 system is an image processing system developed jointly by Videoton

and the institute for Coordination of Computer Technology. This system can be used

to carry digital information from a screen to any accumulators, to make statistical
calculations, to display pictures, to magnify or reduce images and to coupose and
edit text.

A group transmission unit that can be connected to a modular Yes-1011 system was
offered for remote information processing. It transmits information reliably at
moderate speed.

The RP'r/BOF general-purpose terminal control unit (see figure [figure not repro-
ducedl) was shown for the first time. It is used in banking and bookkeeping

applications. Another new item was a unit that reads sylbols off of punchcards;
it is used to read digits and text typed on a punchcard.

Exhibits of the Telefongyar Plant

This plant produces remote data processing units (modems, user stations, a remote
processor) that are well known to the Yes and 8!! computer systems. The plant's
new article--a Yes-8534 (TAP-34) intelligent termina1—-won the fair prize. It
operates at a transmission rate of. 2 ,400 baud, it is made out of highly integrated
components, and it is controlled by a microprocessor. A terminal can transmit data

to a computer or a remote terminal in batch processing mode or in a dialogue system.
Various peripheral units can be connected to it: an alphamnerical keyboard, a

punchcard reader, a flexible magnetic disc accululator, a 0214-180 or “Consul-2111'

printer and a double flexible magnetic disc accumulator with a total capacity of
500,000 bytes.

Products of the ENG Plant

An M777 computer was exhibited for the first time this year at the fair. It is
intended for scientific and technical calculations and for use in measuring systems
and data processing systems. It is capable of graphical expansion to permit solu-
tion of two-dimensional graphical problems. The principal characteristics of the
computer are: Automatic plotting, graphical data output in dialogue mode at high

speed, provision of data bank services in dialogue mode at a high intelligence
level. The unit contains an Ali-2901 basic microprogram processor and three Intel

8085 peripheral processors. The built-in peripheral units include an alphanumerical
graphical screen with a diagonal measurement of 31 an and two places (interfaces)
for connection of a typewriter and an alphanumrical graphical printing unit. Bx-
panded BEYSIKis the programing language.

IGV Exhibits

BUT-100 cash register terminals were exhibited. These are connected to a Yes-1010M
to form a trading enterprise data collection system. The cash register terminals

can be connected to the computer through a transmission line or a data concentrator.
The terminals are supplied with BAN and UPS bar code readers.

A VG-200 duplicator intended to make copies of A4 format documents is also a new
development of this plant. It operates at a speed of 12 copies per minute.

Orion Products

One of the Orion plant's new developments is a Yes-8007 fully duplexed modem; after
receiving the Gold Medal at the Isipzig Fair in 1981, it earned first prize at the
Budapest Pair. This modem quadruples the rate of transmission of existing duplex
modems without changing the transmission method. Owing to this, col-amication in
two-conducter switching circuits may be increased singly by substituting the modems.
Up until now. a rate of 1,200 baud could be achieved only with four-conducter direct
links using an FSK modem. The same transmission rate can be achieved with two-

conductor transmission lines using the new modem built by the Orion plant (AM-12 TD

is the plant code) at lower cost. The Yes—8006 modem is capable of only semiduplex
transmission. Owing to change in transmission directions, a delay of 300 msec is
created within the block. When a fully duplexed Ana-12 'l'Dmodem is used. this
delay is eliminated.

Mention should also be made of a data preparation system called "Ordash' by the
Orion plant. It can be used to collect and monitor data of any form. the system
consists of a microcomputer andeight workplaces. Data from these workplaces are
transcribed onto a disc. These places are supplied with a keyboard-equipped display.

Exhibits of the Institute for Coordination of Computer 'l‘echnology

The institute is focusing its efforts on the use of computer technology in the
national economy. Systems characteristically used in the institute's research work,
to include for agriculture, food industry, power engineering, warehouse management

and transportation, were shown at this fair. Among the exhibits the "'l‘eleterm," a
simple, inexpensive terminal, aroused considerable interest. It possesses a built-in

pushbutton telephone set. It works as a computer terminal, and it provides a direct
communication link, by a telephone line, between an information system and produc-
tion personnel. Microprocessor control means that the equipment can be adapted to
particular tasks. Use of the new unit to control a meatpacking plant warehouse

was demonstrated.

Mention should be made of software created for a color display. This software

could be used in the processing of images in autonomous mode. or to achieve a
link—up with a conputer. 1t can process various sorts of images: medical, meteoro-

logical, materials testing images and so on. In order that it could be used with
large systems, the institute has created a possibility for adapting it to Tim 11/40

and Yes- 1011 coqmters.

EVALUATION OF THO TASK SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS FOR HOHOGENEOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS
[Abstract of article by V. Yu. Bakenrot, V. V. Kolobayev and 0. B. Hakarevich]

[Text] Authors evaluate operation of two algorithms for minimax planning of
solution to a package of simple independent problems in homogeneous computer sys-
tems, based on descending ordering of the problems by their solution time and
assignment of them to machines in that order with regard to machine busy time
(the well known LPT algorithm and its modification), for which there is defined
the range of values of the upper bound of the absolute error of the corresponding
schedules when the specified condition for problem solving time is met. Bibl. 2.

GLOBAL OPTIMUM STRUCTURAL SYNTHESIS FOR DATA TRANSMISSION NETWORK USING
COORDINATION THEORY

{Abstract of article by D. I. HIadenov and T. A. Stoilov}

{Text} The problem of global optimum structural synthesis is formulated and solved.
It considers delay times in networks, reliability and cost and defines the network
structure and communication channel throughput. The problem is formed by composi-
tion of two partial problems, each of which determines certain parameters and
characteristics of those mentioned above. The synthesis process is a procedure
which is affected a certain way by the solutions to the partial synthesis problems.
As a result of this, the solution to the problem of global optimum structural syn-
thesis is derived. The effect of the partial synthesis problems is considered by
using coordination theory algorithms. An example of global synthesis of network
topology and channel throughput by the criterion of cost is given. Figs. 3. bibl. 7.

STRUCTURAL AND LOGICAL METHOD OF APPROXIMATE COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION IN
PROBLEMS OF ALLOCATING COMPUTER CAPACITY

iAbstract of article by V. I. Levin]

iText] The problem of optimum distribution of problems between n computers is
considered. The efficiency of solving the i-th problem on the j-th computer is
811' Considered the criterion of the optimum is the maximum of the summary effi-

ciency from the solution of all problems. A general method is presented for the
approximate search for the extremum of the function of discrete variables, based
on using infinite-valued logic, with the basic operations i\/y-max(x,y)--disjunc-
tion, and x/\y-min(x.y)-conjunction. For the matrix A-lla1j|| of efficiencies,

a logic determinant-characteristic is introduced, the computation of which yields
the solution to the problem. An approximate method for computing this character-
istic, possessing complexity exponential by n, is presented. Tables 2. bibl. 7.

PRINCIPLES OF COMPOSING CONSTRUCTOR PROGRAM FOR GENERATING A SYNTAX PARSER BY
METHOD OF C(k)-GRAMMARS

[Abstract of article by V. S. Zonis and A. S. Shumey]

iText] Discussed are the principles for designing the constructor program for
automatic generation of a syntax parser by using the method of G(k)-grammars,
which is an evolution of the method of LR(k)-grammars. The program consists of
two parts: 1) a subroutine for analysis of the source grammar and representation
of it in main storage in the form of two tables: a table of nonterminai symbols
and a table of grammar rules, and 2) a subroutine proper for generation of a table
‘of the set of parser states. The entire constructor program nas 1200 instructions
in SM-3/SM-4 Assembler. Tables 1, bibliography of 4 titles.

INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR AUTOMATION 0F SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON MULTIPURPOSE RESEARCH
VESSELS

[Abstract of article by 0. S. Zudin, S. N. Domaratskiy, I. P. Kotik, G. N. Kuklin,
A. A. Novikov, L. S. Sitnikov, O. Laaksonen and R. Aarinen]

iTexr] Problems of organization of the structure of scientific research automation
systems (SANI) for multipurpose ships are discussed using as an example the
Integrated System for Automation of Scientific Research on the "Akademik Hatislav
Keldysh," a multipurpose research ship for the USSR Academy of Sciences. This
system combines into a single entity the facilities for automating oceanologic
experiments, automatic ship navigation equipment, facilities for acquisition of
meteosynoptic data and computer facilities in the form of 12 different computers
and 3 crates with modules of CANAC apparatus. It is shown that maximal flexibility
for such systems is afforded by using a hierarchical structure with data processing
and logging distributed by levels of the hierarchy and the bus-modular method of
organizing the hardware at all levels. Problems of computer interaction, organiza-
tion of links between the different subsystems and the selection of interfaces for
the different levels are discussed. Special attention is paid to joint use of the
CANAC system and the IEC instrument bus. Incorporating three resources for the
data logging subsystem is suggested: a parameter description table, a status

table and a directory. Problems of self-identification of data are broached.
Special attention is paid to time tags. Figs. A, bibliography of 6 titles.

DESIGN OF NONHOHOGENBOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS
[Abstract of article by Yu. I. Ryzhikov]

{Text} A computer system is considered as a queueing system of the form n/ﬁ/ﬁ,
where the channels of each of k types have their own parameter "1 for allocation of

servicing time. The system states are described by the total number of requests in
in and by the number of channels of each type that are doing the servicing. An
iteration scheme is suggested for design of the allocation of the number of
requests in an open system with an unrestricted queue and a modification of it

for a restricted queue and for a closed system. A method for computing servicing
time indicators is shown. Characteristics of a PL/l program that implements the
method and a numeric example are given. Tables 1, figs. 2, bibliography of 7 titl.
