[Text] The results of investigations of architectural features of computing sys-
tems with a programmed structure are published in the book. A method of distribut-
ing tasks in the system and a method of addressing machines are proposed which
assure effective accomplishment of computations. Hethods are deVeloped for
parallel nicroprcgralming: the property of non-contradiction of parallel micro-
programs was investigated, the language of simulation of parallel microprcgram
structures and a method of converting Petri networks are described which reduce the
complexity of analysis of parallel Moroprognms for correctness. Some results are
presented on developments of software of systems of mini- and nicro-ccmputers and a
programming system for logical and structural simulation.

The materials of the collection can be useful to specialists in the area of com-

puter technology. scientific workers and graduate students in the specialty of
computers and systems.

[Excerpts] A posting of the USSR National Cosmittee of the International Associa-
tion on Mathematical and Computer modelling IMACS (RICA) in which specialists of
different organizations of 'lbilisi, Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Odessa, Tashkent,
Kishinev, Riga, Kuybyshev and other cities of the Soviet Union participated, was
held on 26-29 October 1980 in Tbilisi at the Tbilisi Scientific Production Associa-
tion Elva.

Academician of the Georgian SSR Academy of Sciences 1. v. Prangishvili, in his re-
port ”Highly Productive mltipa-ocessor Problem-Oriented Computer Complexes for Geo-
physical Problems," presented two models of highly productive multiprocessor compu-
ter complexes with rearranged structure for expeditionary and regional geophysical
computer couplexes. One model, containing up to 64 processors and providing a
speed of up to 100 million operations per second, is related to configuration of
machines with many data flows and a single instruction flow for operating in the
single-problem mode with regular problem algorithm having natural parallslliem.
Another model that provides speed up to several tens of millions cf operations per
second is related to a configuration with many data and instruction flows and oper-
ates effectively in single— and multi-task modes with less regular problem algo-
rithms subject to parallelling.

The high productivity and survivability of the developed nultimicroprocessor compu-
ter systems provided as a result of dynamic rearrangement of the sync. structure
according to the requirements of the computing process, parallelling of the calcu-
lation process at the level of problems, branches of vector and scalar operations
and instructions accomplished without access to an operating system, were noted.

[Excerpt] 6. Final Recommendations on Computer Family Arctdtecture Selection

The conducted analysis made it clear that the strong and weak aspects of the thr
most completely evaluated computing system architectures are the following [1. 1:3.

Interdata 8/32. The architecture of this computing system has the highest total
evaluation for quantitative criteria and gives better results during the running
of test programs. It ins good organization of the interruption system. which as-
sures its efficiency in real time. However, the software of this computing system
is very poor. and this has a direct effect on the cost of its life cycle. There
also are certain doubts about the efficiency of organisation in this computing sys-
tem of protection of the state of the machine duringprooessing of interruptions by
the processor.

1311 3/370. The main merit of this computing system is its powerml software. as a
result of which its architecture has a good indicator of cost of the life cycle.
especially when the cost of program development is high. 0n the other hand. the
interruption system adopted in this computing system makes it difficult to use in
real-time systems. The running of test programs has also shown tint the efficiency
of its architecture is lower than that of the Interdata 8/32 and var-n computing
system architectures. The investigations have made it clear that the Junior models
of that family do not assure sufficiently high indicators during their use in con-
trol systems presenting low requirements for the counting system parameters.

PDP-ll. The 70th model of this family was examined. This computing system Ins
fairly complete software and also shows high characteristics during the running of
test programs. Because of good organization of the interruption system it is well
suited for work in real time. The PDP-ll Ins definite advantages over other con-

sidered computing systems as regards cost of the life cycle. To the merits of this
computing system one can also add the fact that its microprocessor realization
practically exists. A negative aspect of this computing system is a virtual address
space limited to 16 bits.

As a. result of the work done the commitee for selection of CFA architecture prepared
the following recommendations:

5 .
NR OFFICIAL US: ONLY
I'UK UEILULAI. UDI UNI»!

1. It has acknowledged tint the PDP-ll computing system is the most suitable for

construction of a military computer family (110?). The 13!! 8/370 was ranked second.
and the Inter-data 8/32 third.

2. The committee concluded unanimously that a single instruction system and a
single architecture must be adopted for the entire military computer family. The
recommendation that one of the three investigated architectures be used is an
alternative.

3. The committee considers it necessary to moderate the individual limitations
on selection of the computer family architecture (CFA). Among such limitations. in

particular, is the digit capacity of the virtual address space. which restrains
selection of the PDP-ll architecture as the CFA.

The adknowledged winner. the PDP-ll computing system. has the best architecture in
the sense of its application in practice among all the computing systems created

up to now. It is produced in tens of thousands and used in quite varied applica-
tions. It has po'cerml software. which also continues to be developed at the pre-
sent time. For purposes of the conducted investigation it was not important that
the DEC Company had not been designated to produce a military version of the PDP-ll
family. The purpose of the project was to determine the computing system architec-
ture with which various producers (not necessarily producers of the commercial
variant of the system) would be able to develop computing systems satisfying with
their parameters the military requirements.

In accordance with the recommendations the Norden Division of United Technologies
has acquired from the DEC Company a license for the production of a military ver-
sion of the PDP-ll family [8. 19 J. That compnay has been designated to produce
military analogs of all models of the PDP-ll family-~i‘rom the LSI-ll microcomputer
to the large POP-11 70 computer. The military version of the POP—11 family has been
given the name AN 4&1. It is assumed that small. medium and large computing
systems of this family. corresponding to models 151-11. Pop-n/au and mun/70 of
the PDP-ll family. will a very large distribution in tactical data processing sys-
tems. The operating conditions of all Harden computing systems satisfy the corre—
sponding requirements of the military standards and have smaller dimensions and
smaller mass than similar commercial models of the DEC Company. Thus. the comput-
ing system AN/UYK'Ju/Blm occupies about one fourth the volume of the PDP-ll/3h com-
puting system. and weighs about one third as much. As a result of a more complex
technology of production the AN/UYK—hl computing system is much cheaper than the
corresponding models of the PDP-ll family.

Foreword

The attitude of users toward multiprocessor computer systems (ms) with common in-
struction flow fluctuates from approval of these systems as the only possible ver-
sion of the digital computer of the future to complete rejection of their effective-
nass. Essentially, systems of this type are problem-oriented. Therefore, their
use in the corresponding fields may actually yield unusually high effectiveness.

0n the other hand, atempts to use multiprocessor computer systems in fields and
modes not inherent to them do not yield the proper effect.

Multiprocessor computer systems with common information flow are effective for prob-
lems whose resolving algorithms first met sufficiently good parallelling and second
require either high speed or low cost-productivity ratio.

The range of problems encompassed by the conjunction of these two requirements is
rather broad. They include problems of random process filtration, pattern recogni-
tion, solution of equations in partial derivatives, modelling of dynamic object:
and many others, i.e., problems of processing the results of geophysical investi-
gations, intonation from satellites, design and so on.

The proposed collection is devoted to the most important aspects of development and
application of multiprocessor computer systems. Problems concerning both the prin-
ciples of multiprocessor computer system design, sets of instructions and control
systems and organization of the computing process, including making calculations

in parallel and organization of algorithms that minimize problem-solving time.
since the same problem can be solved by several methods, a mater of articles is
devoted to selection of algorithms that permit broad parallelling and to organiza-
tion of the sequence of calculations if broad parallelling is impossible.

Problems of developing complexes that include control cosputer systems as the cen-
tral computer are considered in four articles.

As a whole, the collection will be useful to both engineers working in fields of

multiprocessor computer system design and application and to students and graduate
students studying specific problems of modern electronic machine building.

within several years. These structures were called computer media since they were
regarded as spaces filled with physical objects whose functional properties could
be varied externally.

The search for ways to develop computers based on computer media was conducted in
all directions. The technological possibilities of producing media were considered,
the optimum functional couponent bases were determined, the theory of structural
organization was developed and methods of logic synthesis in the media and algo-
rithmic parallelling devices to the level of nicrooperations were worked out. New
problems were determined and new difficulties arose during the investigations. De-
velopment of microelectronics was not as vigorous as initially assused, but the suc-
cess achieved determined the solution of a nuaber of problems. Thus, the extensive
use of microprograming and the appearance of microprocessor units and programme
logic matrices had a very iuportant effect on the development of the idea of creat-
ing homogeneous structures. Development of theory of parallel processes influenced
the solution of some software probl-zs.

The concept based on a combination of devices for parallel representation of algo-
rithms and methods of microprogram interpretation of them was established during
the investigations. This concept was called parallel microprograming. Devices
for microprogram description of algorithms in limiting-parallel form, methods of
interpreting this description by automaton networks, methods of asynchronous coupo-
sition of algorithms, methods of embedding microprograms in logic matrices and
language for microprogram description of parallel processing structures and a sys-
tem for simulating their operation in an ordinary computer were developed on its
basis.

All the foregoing is outlined in six chapters. The contents of the chapters are re-
lated. However, chapters 2, s and 6 can be recomended to those interested only in
limit-parallel algorithms, while chapters 3 and 4 can be reccuuended to those who
are working in the field of synthesis of asynchronous control and parallel processes
ses, omitting from these chapters the few places which concern parallel substitution
systems. Moreover, chapter 4 can be understood as an outline of the original method
of synthesizing logic function systems for inclusion in prograsmable logic matrices
and can be read separately. .

[Excerpt] 1. Introduction. Purpose of Paper

Active cooperation between the USSR and the GDR in the field of using the Bess-6
computer began at the moment when the internal systems software for the seen-6 had
already been mainly formulated in both countries in the form of independent operat-
ing systems (OS) and programing systems. The operating system DISPAK [expansion un-
kncm] (the operating systems DUSNA, 1PM and nan-70 were also developed in the USSR)
of the MONITOR SYSTEM warm and sass-moor. programing system achieved the greatest
distribution in the USSR. the operating system smos (Batch-Processing Multilan-
guage Operating System), which (also like the operating system DISPAR) was essen-
tially based on the first operating system-~the 0-68 for' the 88814-6, was developed
in the GDR for the SSH-6.

The MONITOR SYSTEM DUBNA (as of 1969) was taken as the basis in developing the
RAMOS programing system.

Different systems interfaces were offered to users in both countries for developing
their own programs as a result of this development of the systems software of the
Bass-6, which caused specific difficulties in exchange of program between the or-
ganizations of both countries.

Investigations were conducted in the USSR to transfer individual elemnts of the
RAMOS programming system. The ALGOL-COR and FORTRAN-60R translators built into the
mNI'rOR SYSTEM DUBNA were widespread among users in the USSR. The presence of these
translators within the Momma SYSTEM DUBNR facilitated adaptation in the USSR of

the programing systems developed in the GDR, but did not completely resolve the
problems of transfer. Therefore, USSR and GDR system prograsmers agreed on joint in-
vestigations in 1974 to connect the macs programing system to the operating system
DISPAK.

described.

In conclusion the authors consider the given paper among the colleen problems of
program system transfer.

2. Principles of Joining
2.1. Functions and Structure of DISPAK

Hultiprograming is realized in DISPAK for 16 virtual channels (four for the paper
tape operating system).

The information buffering mode is used extensively in the operating system as input
and output information. This psi-mist one to specifically organize effective load-
ing of the central processor of the sass-6. There may be up to 255 problems in the
input buffers of the operating system and each problem reports information on the
required resources to the operating system through special sections that comprise
the problem certificate. A special planning part of the operating system from the
total line of input problems selects the corresponding problems and transfers them
for processing. The planning system algorithm takes into account the total value
of physical resources of the BBSM-S, the presence of resources required for per-
formance of a given task, the priority of the problem, its weight (some function of
reading time and the volume of indicated resources) and also the specific mode of
selecting problems for solution assigned by the human operator (actually the ratio
between the number of "long" and "short" programs).

The operating system allocates the resources to the problem which occupied the vir-
tual channel for processing according to the requirements of the problem. These
resources are allocated statically and are attached to the problem during the entire
time of solving it. One can demonstrate (and reject) only magnetic tapes and disks
dynamically. The capacity ‘of the internal storage should not exceed 321: words.

There is an apparatus (so-called basic capabilities of the operating system) in the
disk version of the operating system which permits one to construct programing sys-
tem consisting of the main and subordinate problems which, occupying the same 16

2
FOR OFFICIJAJL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

virtual channels, can exchange resources and messages with each other. Information

can be processed by means of this apparatus by using internal storage capacity
greater than 32): words.

The operating system DISPAK supports the operation of sass-5 complexes joined on
the basis of a common disk memory. There is the capability of operating with mag-
netic tapes installed on different 3294-6 and on message exchange between machines.
These capabilities are essentially sufficient to construct systems under the control

of the operating system DISPAK which could be used by the aggregate resources of
several DESK-6 computers.

A set of programing systems operates under the control of the operating system
DISPAK. The operating system ”knows nothing" about the internal structures of the
programing systems. The operating system only supports a specific set of functions
(extra codes) required for functioning of the programing systems. The operating
system also makes available specific information security devices to programing
systems. Most programing systems do not now utilise the basic capabilities of the
operating system DISPAK (but these devices can operate at the level of fulfilling
the working program) and operate in the area with capacity of no more than 32K
words. The programming systems are arranged on a special dis): (tape). from whence
each problem belonging to a specific programing system loads the corresponding
parts of the given programing system into its own internal storage. The program-
ming system thus operates on the resources of a specific user problem in the mathe-
matical mode. All the specific functions are realized by means of the extra codes
of the operating system DISPAK. This method of organizing the work of programing
systems (outside operating systems) has both its positive and negative aspects. The
following should be included among the negative aspects.

Each programing system is forced to have its own "instrment" components: a moni-
tor, editor, loader and so on. For this reason the user experiences difficulties
if he must use components (for example, libraries) of different programing systems.
This disadvantage is smoothed over in real operation by the fact that the multi-
language programming system momma SYSTEM [mm is finding ever wider distribution
at most computer centers.

A positive aspect in this organization of operating system and programing system
interaction is that there is definite simplicity in connection of any new program-
ming system. The programming system should be oriented only toward the set of
extra codes of the operating system DISPAK. This partially explains the fact of
how rapidly the suns programing systems could be connected to the operating sys-
tem DISPAK.

2.2. Functions and structure of ms

The bench processing mode using multiprogramming that provides effective use of a
central processor and internal storage is realized in the RAMOS.

The specific goals of developing the names also included the following:

--connection of different computers (Siemens 4004/26, Yes-1020 and control com-
puters of TPAI type) to the BESM-6:

[Excerpts] A significant shift has been noted recently in the approach to software
development (no) for control conputers and specifically for specialized machines
(S‘rsVM [Specialized digital conputersl). mereas attention was concentrated mainly
in early dewlopments of technology on programming languages and means of program
translation, complex program design syst-ns, including debugging devices, were sub-
sequently developed. The need to develop complete program design technology, be-

program as a software article, its documentation: and accospanimt during circula-
tion. has now become obvious (l, 21. The characteristic features of the structures
and specifications of sum require development of the technology for working out
programs based on cross-systems realized on powerful production (instmnt) uni-
versal type digital computers.

An example of taking this approach toward development of control computer complexes
(ICU?) may be the YaL'ZA system [3]. The first version of the YaUza-l programing
automation system based on the III-220 production digital computer (1970—1975) mainly
performed functions of program translatiOn and did not solve debugging problems.
The first versions of the Yam-6 programing and debugging automation system SAPO
based on the Bass-6 digital production computer (1975-1977) were developed as
adapted cross-systems that perform a rather wide range of cowlex of problems of
design. debugging. development control, srcvn program doculsntation and so on.
Modern versions of the YaUZA-é SAPO (1980) in combination with benches for complex
dynamic debugging provide a complete production cycle of program development for a
wide range of control and specialized digital computers. The production process
of developing ICU? for S‘rsVH can generally be divided into the following phases
(Figure l) :

The first phase is general design of the control systan and the algorithm, in-
cluding determination of the system problems, selection of control methods, the

t

type of specialized digital computers, methods of organizing calculations and the
structure of control program complexes, formulation of general and special algo-
rithms and organization of the STsVM memory:

The second phase is preparation of hardware, which includes adaptation of the
cross-system for a specific STsVH, preparation of the SAPO data base and working
out instructional materials from programing and debugging technology:

The third phase is development of programs, including writing the programs in algo-
rithmic languages, macrolanguages or autocodss and translation, monitoring and
loading of the programs into the anH memory;

The fourth phase is program debugging by determined tests through an instruction
interpreter, obtaining the statistical and time characteristics of programs and
checking the connections of program control and information modules:

The fifth phase is production of machine carriers for program input into STsVH and
documentation of the program complex.

These phases require a rather powerful digital production computer. Moreover, pro-
gram development includes phases of final complex dynamic debugging and testing:

The sixth phase is complex dynamic debugging of the m? based on the STsVM with use
of simulation benches to model the external conditions of using the STsVM in the
control system;

The seventh phase is half-scale or full-scale tests using real control facilities
or simulators of them to check the efficiency and characteristics of KUP during
functioning of the system under conditions which were formulated by assignment of
the control system for development.

The latter two phases are usually conducted by using special equipment and are not
considered in this paper. After development and testing of the KO? has been com-
pleted, the complex can be circulated, modernised and corrected during the entire
operating time of the system. To do this, the technology of accompanying the KUP,
which can be based to a significant degree on program design devices, should be

developed.

The first five of the indicated phases of the unified production process for design
of conplex program systems using the YaUZA-G SAPO are described below.

Conclusions

The considered phases of program development using the Yam-6 SAPO have unified
engineering, programming and organizational bases. The unity of the engineering
base includes the fact that the control program complex is being developed and be-
ing debugged autonomously on a single digital production computer-the sass-6.
Whereas sTsVH have devices for autonomous program debugging and correction, the
unified technology requires organization of a channel for the STsVM to conunicate
with the digital production computer for operational exchange of m variations
and support of design unity. Dynamic debugging on simulation benches permits the
use of other digital production computers as well.

The unity of the programming base is supported by the general design data base
which contains the initial texts of all programs, libraries of absolute or load
modules, certificates of translated programs, descriptions of global variables,
debugging assignments and also other data on the m and individual programs.

The unity of the organizational base includes mnitoring the progress of programs
through the phases of the production process , keeping an account of the results of
each phase, the expended resources and the number of errors of one or another type.
Moreover, the col-sand supervisor accomplishes automatic monitoring of the course
of design with various degrees of detail.

The standardised technology of transfer of the Yam-6 SAPO by users to other or-
ganizations should especially be determined, in which the following is transferred:

a magnetic tape with a copy of the standard reference version of the SAPO ad-
justed to the standard s'rsvm

a copy of the reference magnetic tape containing test and control information;

a control pack with complete control task that checks the operation of the
subsystems of the Yam-6 SAPO;

a model for unsealing the standard output information.

A complete set of the operational documentation formulated as enterprise standards
is also transferred. The complete set of standards (31 standards) contains infor-
mation on the system as a whole and about each subsystem for describing the SAPO.
programing and debugging control languages and also supervision on preparation and
operation of the system.

The technology of transferring the Yam-6 SAPO permits the user not only to become
familiar with the system but also to assimilate all of its operating modes on the
example at the standard STsVM and then to convert to adaptation of the system for
a specific S'rsVH.

The Yam-6 SAPO consists of 23 subsystems that realize the enumerated problems.
The SAPO is adapted to different conditions of application (different STsVH, auto-
codes and cosmand characteristics) by the automated method through the adjusting
devices included in the SAPO. The overall program capacity of the SAPO comprises
330,000 of the sass-6, of which 302,000 are marine-independent and remain un-
changed when the STsVM is replaced. Information modules for adjustment to the
STsVM and the coamand comprise 16,000 words, while the machine-independent program
procedures occupy approximately 12,000 words. The YaUZA—G SAPO was adjusted to 26
types of 51‘s“! in 14 organizations during the period from 1976 through 1980.

[Text] Author discusses probl- of ensuring reliability of complex software syst-s
for control from the positions of modern systems engineering, methods of enhancing
reliability of the components and the software wet. as a whole, and nethods for
checking functiOning. Factors affecting reliability are analyzed.

Preface

The theoretical and practical level of the modern theory of reliability of hardware
is rather high, and not one complex hardware system is designed without a simultan-
eous analysis of its future reliability. To ensure a given hardware reliability, a
broad spectrum of methods and means are used that allow developing highly reliable
complex systems from relatively unreliable components. These methods and means use
various forms of redundancy to prevent failures and minimize their effect on the
quality of functioning of the systems. A new type of product—complex software sys-
tems for information control and processing syst-snhas recently entered the area
of interests of the theory and practice of the study of reliability. During opera-
tion of such systems, ma1functions and failures occur that have been caused by dis-
tortions of programs and data. These distortions not only Occur in connection with
anomalies of operation of apparatus, but can also show up during trouble-free opera-
tion of the computer that implements the given software system. The critical impor-
tance of the systems that control and process information has dictated the need of
studying the causes of software failures and methods of countering them.

The absence of aging and physical destruction of software has led to the energence

of the view by a number of experts that methods of the existing theory of reliabili-
ty are wholly inapplicable to the study of the reliability characteristics of soft-
ware. However, analysis of the malfunctions and failures during prolonged operation
of complex software systans has allowed finding analogies to hardware breakdowns and

failures. A number of concepts, problem statements and methods of analysis of hard-
ware reliability have been successfully applied to the study of software reliability.
A new branch of the general theory of reliability has begun to be developed: the
theory of software reliability; its subject of study is the serviceability of com-
plex software systems for control and processing of intonation.

The major factors in ensuring software reliability, just as for hardware reliability,
are the various forms of redundancy: structural, informational and temporal. Redun-
dancy allows monitoring of software functioning processes and data validity, and pre-
venting failures or reducing their effect on system efficiency. Resources for using

redundancy in a program have always been limited; this leads to the need of rational

distribution of resources between various forms of redundancy and various methods

of raising software reliability.

The lack in the majority of cases of physical destruction and need of repair of pro-
grams has raised sharply the possibility of automatic restoration of programs after
their failures without human participation. There has arisen the problem of quanti—
tative research and development of methods of expeditiously restoring programs and
data that enable reducing the period of restoration and consequences of the failure
to the level of a short-lived malfunction. It has proved possible to distinguish
the phenomenum of malfunction and failure by time of restoration, the tolerable
values of which in turn are a function of the inertia of the subscribers—the
sources and consumers of the information.

In chapter 1 of this monograph, the main problems of studying an enhancing the
reliability of complex software systems are considered; the factors affecting soft-
ware reliability and the features of applying the main concepts and mathematical
apparatus of reliability theory to these products are investigated; and the methods
and criteria of evaluating software reliability and prerequisites for determining
the various indicators of reliability are analyzed.

In chapter 2, the characteristics of disturbances capable of causing malfunctions
and failures during functioning of programs are generalized; garbling of source data
coming from the human operator and garbling caused by malfunctions in data transmis-
sion systems are considered. Special attention is paid to investigating the statis-
tical characteristics of errors in software systems and to the methods of
describing thu.

Chapter 3 generalizes the methods of designing reliable software systems. In it,
features of structural design of individual subprograms, data files and software
systems as a whole are considered; methods of checking the correctness of standard
program structures are for-sliced; and the main methods of determinate testing of
programs in the process of debugging them and eliminating errors are presented.
Censiderable attention has been paid to determining the state of debugging of pro-
grams and the link between indicators of the state of debugging and software func-
tioning reliability. Here an analysis has been made of the problem of statistical
checking of software system reliability in the process of debugging it and tests
aimed at determining the main indicators of reliability.

In chapter lo, methods of using redundancy to check functioning of programs and to

expeditiously restore them after malfunctions are presented. Methods of evaluating
the quality of algorithmic and program guarding against malfunctiOns and failures

FOR omvﬂt USE ONLY
during program operation are given. Optimization of outlays for introduction of
redundancy and debugging of programs to ensure prescribed reliability of their func-
tioning is considered.

Given in the appendix is the general technology of design of reliable software sys-
tems that considers the limitation on resources to be allocated to ensure reliability.

The importance of the problem of quantitative study and enhancement of reliability
of software functioning is confirmed by the materials of all-union [41] and inter-
national i76, 77, 88] conferences and is reflected in the sharp increase in the num-
ber of journal articles in this field [8]. There are no generalizing books on soft-
ware reliability in the domestic literature and the author hopes that this book will
fill this gap to some extent. One would expect that a number of serious generaliz-
ing studies will be devoted to this problem in the near future to create the bases
for the theory of software reliability.

Production of software systems is developing rapidly and accordingly the theoretical
base is developing to analyze and synthesize them. Nevertheless, many concepts are
just forming and there is a lack of precise definitions of a number of new terms
that have appeared. Even such major terms as mathematical and program facilities
[software] [matemsticheskoye i programmnoye obespecheniye] cannot always be separa-
ted. The author uses primarily the terms software [programmnoye obespecheniye] and
software systems [kompleksy programm]. Attempts have been made to refine and com-
plete the definition of a number of terms used in analyzing software reliability,
however there is still much work to be done in the field of software terminology.

Reliability is a major indicator of the quality of software; however, it is still
characterized by a number of functional and design criteria of quality, the selection
of which to a considerable extent is a function of its purpose. Being used more and
more extensively to evaluate the constructive characteristics of programs are the
efficiency of use of storage and throughput of the computer, complexity. correctness,
structurization, mobility, documentability, cognisability and other criteria. A pre-
cise measurement of the actual values of indicators of quality of the program product
is becoming an ever more important problem as a consequence of the increase in soft-
ware production volume, the increase in its camplexity, and as a result of the
increase in importance of the functions performed by software systems in various
fields of the national economy. It is necessary to develop unified methods of
measuring. monitoring and forecasting of program quality indicators as well as of the
outlays to achieve them and to provide an objective evaluation of the quality of

each program.

The author wishes to express his gratitude to his colleagues who helped him in the
work on the monograph: T. V. Kolganova, A. A. Shtrik, H. A. Hinayev, B. A. Pozin and
s. A. Blau, and to E. A. Gladkova for keeping him regularly informed on new
publicatiOns.

The author wishes to express special thanks to the reviewer, B. A. Golovkin, doctor
of engineering science, who made a number of valuable comments that led to substan-
tial improvement of the book, and to V. V. Kul'ba, candidate of engineering science,
for thorough scholarly editing of the manuscript.

[Text]

1. Much attention of radioastronomers has recently been attracted by the investiga-
tion of pulsars, which are point sources emitting wideband signals in the form of
periodic short pulses. Because of scattering of the interstellar medium, the pulse
length on earth considerably exceeds their length near the radiation source and may
comprise tens and even hundreds of milliseconds. The effect of scattering also
leads to the reduction of the asplitude of the signals being received.

Several methods of eliminating the effect of scattering in observing pulsars are
known in which multichannel electronic systems or digital correlators are used [1].
These methods are similar to those of complex signal processing with large multipli-
cation of the band by the pulse length (mf >> 1).

We feel that acoustooptical devices [2], specifically devices that permit correla-
tion processing of wideband signals of long length, are promising to eliminate the
effect of scattering when observing pulsars. These are acoustooptical correlators

charge coupling) that integrate or store the signal are used. Unlike ordinary
acoustooptical correlators [3], in which the correlation function is shaped sequen-

The second term in this expression is the desired autocorrelation function and the
first is a constant component. The term a(x/s) contains cross-correlation functions
and reduces the signal/noise ratio at the device output [7].

As can be seen from (1), the autocorrelation function at the output is tor-ed as a
function of coordinate x, i.e., the signal distribution in the linear series cospon-
ents of the P25 corresponds to the desired autocorrelation function. These signals
are transferred by the control pulse coming from the computer to the storage sec-
tions (the linear shift registers of the us) and are then fed sequentially by a
special interface [8] to the Elektronika-loo comuter.

After the necessary processing. the signals are fed to an oscillograph (081‘s). to
an automatic digital printer (ATsPu) and so on. Thus, the considered device is a
hybrid optical-acoustical processing system in which correlation analysis is accom-
plished in the optical system. The renaining processing is accomplished in a con-
puter that permits the operating modes of the correlator to be changed by program.
for example, to print out the results of observing individual signals, to operate
in the pulse storage mode and so on.

The Elektronika-lOO computer was used in our experiments. The investigation was
conducted in two modes. In the first storage was carried out only in the P25 of
the components and in this case storage comprised T n 10 ms: in the second mode an
additional computer memory was introduced where the results of 10 separate millisec-
ond storage cycles were added.

Noise signals from two noise generators were fed to the outputs of the correlator,
in addition to identical pulse signals (AF = 260 kHz) that simulate pulsar signals.
These signals simulated the input noise of the receivers.

A signal 10 ms long at one of the correlator inputs is shown in Figure 2, a. The
result of processing it, achieved at the linear output of the P25, is illustrated
in Figure 2, b. Each point on the photograph corresponds to a separate linear com-
ponent of the P25, while the vertical deflection is proportional to the value of
the signal on it. The distancebetween adjacent linear components comprised 0.32
microsecond in the time scale in our case. As can be seen from Figure 2, h the
half-width of the autocorrelation function is equal to r z 3.9 microseconds at cal-
culated value of T = l/AP : 3.8 microseconds. Thus, the derived contraction coef-
ficient comprised K - T/T - 2,500.

Similar experiments were conducted with signals T = 1.28 second long, when not only
the linear components of the P28 were used for storage but the memory of the Elek-
tronika-IOO computer as well. In this case a contraction coefficient K I 3°105 was
obtained. It is obvious from the given results that the signal is confidently sep-
arated from the noise at the correlator output.

Thus, one can hope that the use of acoustooptical devices will make it possible to
sisplify the pulsar signal processing system and to improve the paraneters of re-
ceiving systems.

The correlation devices considered here can also be used to process interferometer
signals, specifically aulticoaponent radiotelescopes with aperture synthesis [lo]
and in this case devices based on spatial-multichannel nodulators [9, ll] are of
special interest. These devices are very pronising not only to process signals in
radioastmnonical but in other different radioengineering systems where correlation
processing of wideband signals of great length must be carried out.

[Text] Introduction

Correlation processing can be used for cosmic video information in at least two as-
pects: for coordinate tying of images of the earth's surface and other planets ob-
tained at different moments of time and from different sensors and for extracting
meteorological data.

when investigating the chronological changes in cosmic photoinages and when the im-
ages obtained in different spectral bands are compared, it becomes necessary to join
them precisely. Accurate correction of the geometric distortions of the images be-
ing joined should be carried out to ensure the possibility of this joining. Data
for this correction can be obtained by correlation detection of the fragments of the
photoimages to be corrected and the measurements of the coordinates of terrain ref-
erence points [1]. It is obvious that the presence of the indicated geometric dis-
tortions will have a negative effect on the reliability of recognition: therefore,
preliminary correction of these distortions is necessary, which is accOIIPlished when
the image is recorded.

10 gather data on the direction and velocity of wind in different sections of the
globe, space photographs of the cloud cover transmitted from geosynchronous satel-
lites at intervals of 30 minutes are used nore extensively. The required data are
obtained by recognition and measurement of the motions of individual cloud forma-
tions. The negative factor here that affects the reliability of identification when
using the correlation method may be defamation of the cloud formations. Extensive
experimental investigations on a sufficient number of images must be conducted to

determine the boundaries and conditions of applicability of the correlation method
in this problem, the same as in the previous problem.

The given paper is the initial attempt to conduct these investigations by using an
optical heterodyne correlator (06K) circuit [2]. Its main advantage compared to
the known holographic matched filtration circuit [3] includes the absence of the
need to manufacture holographic filters for reference images along with retaining
the very valuable capability of spatial filtration of the frequency features which
coherent optics gives. Moreover, the OGK scheme has a potentially higher instrment
accuracy due to the photoelectric correlation image readout system and due to the
absence of such error sources as aberration, inaccurate focussing, spatial noise and
nonlinear distortions of the holographic filter and the objective of the second
Fourier transform.

We recall that there are two spatially dispersed input apertures in the OCR scheme:
one for the reference slide h (plane P1) and the other for the signal slide 9 (plane
P2) (Figure l). The image of the signal slide {+1 is superimposed on the image of
the reference slide ho in the plane of diaphragm a (plane P5) by with a hologram
lens so in the first Fourier plane P4 created by lens L1 (plane P3) upon illmina-
tion of the input slides h and g by a parallel coherent light beam. Images ho and
9+1 were multiplied out and spatial integration was accomplished by a quadratic pho-
todetector of the EEO [photomultiplier]. Since the moving image of the signal slide
9+1 has a doppler shift of light frequency proportional to the spatial carrier fre-
quency and the rate of motion of the hologram lens in the Fourier plane, electrical
oscillations with doppler division frequency whose envelope describes the cross-
correlation function of the input images as the hologram lens moves, occur at the
F80 output. this envelope was observed on the oscillograph screen after additional
electric filtration and detection. The images were processed with suppressed opti-
cal constant of the component for which the point shutter 3 was introduced to the
center of the Fourier plane P4 directly in front of the hologram lens. Thus, the

ed by lens L2 (plane Pg) in front of the photocathode of the m to optimize the
signal/noise ratio at the correlator output. Accordingly, the positions and dimen-
sions of the reference fragment were established by regulation the position and
dimensions of rectangular diaphragm E (which was two crossed micrometric slits).
The fragment of the reference slide established by means of diaphragm 1-: usually
had two squares with side of 1.8 an in all the measurements.

Investigations were conducted on a moch of the 06K in which a hologram modulator
in the form of a drum 200 mm in diameter with 17 hologram lenses having focal dis-
tance of 300 mm fixed on 35-mm Hurst-900 photographic film, was used. The drum
was rotated uniformly at a speed of 1 rpm by an electric motor with friction reduc-
er. Thus, the seaming period of the signal image with respect to the reference
fragment comprised 59 .ms through the x axis. An electronic oscillograph of type
51-55, the scanning of which was synchronized by passing the hologram lenses through
the optical axis of the correlator, was used for the measurements. An example of
correlation recognition of an image fragment of the earth's surface is shown in
Figure 2. The illuminated square in the photograph of figure 2, a denotes a frag-
ment selected as a reference fragment while the entire photograph denotes the signal
slide. Scanning is along the horizontal.

1. Investigation Correlation Identification of Fragments of Photographs of the
Earth's Surface

Space photographs of sections of the earth's surface (region of the volga upland)
obtained from Meteor satellites on 1 and 15 September 1976 in the spectral range
of 0.6-0.7 micron (Figure 3) were used for experiments in correlation identifica-
tion using the OGK. The indicated images were processed on a computer, at the in-
put of which preliminary correlation of the geometric images was carried out.

 

Figure 3. Fragments of Space Photographs of Section of Earth's Surface

The image component had the shape of a rectangle with dimensions Alx - 50 microns
and Aly - 200 microns. To increase contrast, the photographs were subjected to con-
tact printing on contrast photographic paper with subsequent rephotographing on
Mikrat—JOO film. Rephotographing occurred with reductions of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8.
The dimensions of the image components corresponding to the scales are presented in
Table 1.

Since Alx is one-fourth the size of Aly, the requirements on the accuracy of deter-
mining the motion in the direction of the x axis are considerably higher. For this
reason the accuracy of measuring the coordinates of the fragments was determined
along the x axis in conducting the given investigation.

The accuracy of determining the coordinates was estimated in the following manner.
The signal slide was moved along the X axis and at the same time the position of

The individual values of the mean square errors vary over a rather wide range.
Nevertheless the following conclusions can be made. First. no appreciable depen-
dence on the image scale can be detected at all. Second, themean value of the mean
square error a for six neasureaents made at scanning rate of 0.5 Ins/cm (5.57 mi-
crons) is approximately one-half the corresponding value for eight measurements at
scanning rats of l ms/cn (11.8 microns). Third. the mean values of the mean square
errors in the case of cross-correlation, although few. are higher than in the case
of autocorrelation (these values comprised 6.75 and 4.40 microns at scanning rate
of 0.5 ms/cm and 12.45 and 11.1 microns at scanning rats of l ms/cn).

Detailed analysis of the experimental data showed that the accuracy of determining
the displacement of the correlation maxim is limited by the operating instabili-
ties of the correlator (specifically, the instabilities of the rotational speed of
the hologram lens, synchronization of hologram lens rotation and scanning of the
oscillograph beam) and by radio noise. It is obvious upon transition tron seaming
rate of 0.5 ms/cm to l ms/cn that errors related to rounding or! the value of the
coordinate of the correlation naximu: with accuracy to the small division of the
cathode-ray tube screen begin (one division corresponds to 5 microns on the input
slide at scanning rate of 0.5 Its/an and to 10 microns at scanning rats of l Ins/an).
Due to the fact that seaming was accomplished within the dimensions of the refer-
ence tragmsnt (a square with sides of 1.8 Ian), the effect of aberrations of the op-
tical system was probably insignificant.

As can be seen from Table 2. the value of the mean square error is hardly dependent
on the image scale. Consequently, the relative accuracy of measuring the coordin-
ates increases with an increase of image scale. For example, the value 61/1 in-
creased fourfold upon transition from a scale of 1x8 to one of 1:2 for the case of
cross-correlation at scanning rats of 0.5 ms/cm.

It follows from consideration of Table 2 that the coordinates of. fragments can be
measured with an optical heterodyne correlator with an error considerably less than
the dimensions of the input image resolving component. or course, this result is
achievable if the natural resolution of the oorrelator exceeds that in the image.

We note that similar results were found earlier with respect to a holographic corre-
lator [3]. An approach was developed in [S] that permits one to give a natural ex-
planation to the indicated results within the framework of already developed theory
of signal separation on a background of additive Gauss noise.

The values of the signal/noise ratio for the cases of auto- and cross-correlation

at four values of the scale (the analysed fragments were selected on the same sec-
tion of the photographs) are presented in Figure 5. Broken lines 1 and 2 join
points that characterize the ratio glam” for cases of auto- and cross-correla-
tion, respectively. Is is the value of the correlation maximum and 13h.“ is the
mean value of noise within the oscillograms. Broken lines 3 and 4 connect points

1“,...“ is the value of the maxim- noise ejection within the oscillogram. all four
broken lines have minimum values at M 1:1, reach a maximn at H 1:4 and again de-
crease at H 1:8. As follows from the results, the optima value with respect to the
signal/noise ratio should be regarded as a scale of 1:4. An increase of the scale
results in a decrease of this ratio due to constriction of the band of spatial sig-
nal frequencies effectively used by the correlator. A decrease of the scale to 1:8
also causes a decrease of the signal/noise ratio. this time because of losses of
image infatuation content that arise upon raphctography on this scale.

mrves 1 and 2 reach a maximum with area of the fragment of the reference slide on
the order of 8 m2. The value of the signal/noise ratio then begins to drop, which
may be explained by the fact that the effect of aberration and phase errors between
the signal and reference images at the output of the optical system of the corre-
lator, introduced by the Fourier transform lens, the collimator, the holographic
lens and also by phase inhomogeneities of the slide substrates, increases as the
aperture increases. The dependence of the ratio Ish.lax/I;h.max on the area of the

which the values of two maximal: blips on the oscillogram must be measured and the

ratio must be determined. If both blips are of noise origin, the ratio is on the
order of i. If the ratio significantly exceeds 1 (on the order of 5-7 in our case).
then the highest ratio can be related to an identified frag-ant.

It should be emphasized that the correlation function nodule rather than its square
is measured with the optical heterodyne correlator, as in the case of a holographic

correlator. Therefore, the values of the signal/noise ratio equal to 5-7 are equiv-
a1ent to values of signal/noise ratio equal to 25-49 in the case of a holographic
correlator.

the effect of installing an optimizing amplitude space filter (0?) in the 8000!“!
frequency plane was studied during the investigations. A finished filter previous-
ly obtained for several different images was used as the 0!"; consequently, this
filter was not optimum in the total sense. Nevertheless it turned out that the
signal/noise ratio improved by a factor of 1.5-2 when the given filter was in-
stalled, whereas the ratio Ishmax/Tihmax decreased on the average from 1.31 to
1.16. the results confirm the usefulness of using or specially manufactured for
the given type of images.

let us dwell on the results of investigating the dependence of the correlation sax-
imun on the angle of rotation of the reference slide with respect to optimal orien-
tation. This problem is primarily of interest from the viewpoint of requirements
on the accuracy of installing the fragments to be analyzed by angle.

The angular dependence of the correlation maximal (in relative units) is shown in
Figure 7 for the case of autocorrelation and inage scale of 1:2. the curve reaches
a maximum at angle equal to zero and drops one-half at angles of rotation 00.5 of
approximately 1 2'. It must be noted that the separate curves found in different
scales are characterized by rather large variety of values of angles 60.5' from
1.5 to 4°. The nain reason for this variability consists in the fact that, on the
one hand, individual image fragments differ significantly from the viewpoint of
informative parts in then and on the other hand it was difficult to join the center
of rotation to the center of the fragment being analyzed and as a result the frag-
ment not only rotates but is shifted along the Y axis. which leads to a sore rapid

On the whole the values of angles 00,5 correspond to those which should be expected.
In the general case the value of m, 5 should decrease as the area of the fragment
increases, i.e., the critical orientation of the fragment will increase.

2. Investigating Correlation Identification of Picture Fragments of Cloud
formations

Three photographs transmitted from a geosynchronous satellite on 22 July 1975: one
at 2115. two at 2145 and three at 2245 Greenwich time, were used in the experimental
investigations. The coordinates of the point under the satellite were 0' latitude
and 115' west longitude. The image component had the shape of a square with side
of so microns. which corresponded to a square with side of 3.6 km on the earth's
surface. The investigations were conducted both in the autocorrelation mode when
sections of image 2 were used as the signal and reference slides and in the cross-
correlation mode when sections of images 1 and 2 (at time interval of 30 minutes)
were used. Moreover, single experiments of images 2 and 3 (at interval of 60 min-
utes) were conducted in the cross-correlation mode.

A photograph which is one-fourth of the total image 2 obtained from a geosynchronous
satellite is presented as an example in Figure 3. Pour sections (denoted by the
numbers in the figure) were selected in the photographs being analyzed. 'the frag-
ments were subjected to correlation processing when conducting the given investiga-
tion. Magnified images of the indicated sections with the following types of over-
cast are presented in Figure 9: cirrus l, cutulus and stratoct-ulus 2. cusulus 3
and cumulus with closed cells 4.

As when processing the images of the earth's surface. the sections to be analyzed
were rephotographed on hikrat-SOO film, as when processing images of the earth's
surface. To select the most optimum information recording density. the rephoto-
graphing was carried out both with variation of scale and with reduction of it by

a factor of 2, 4, 6 and 8. The functions for the signal to maximtlm noise blip ratio
Islam” for auto- and cross-correlation at five values of scale are presented in
Figure 10. Broken lines 1 and 2 connect the points that characterize the signal/
noise ratio for the case of auto-correlation of image fragments belonging to sec-
tions 2 and 1, respectively. Broken lines 3 and 4 correspond to cross-correlation
of fragments of the same image sections (the fragment of the same name had the
shape of a square with side of 2 on). he follows from the results. the highest
values of the signal/noise ratio are reached at a scale of ltd; therefore, subse-
quent investigation was conducted with images of this very scale.

The accuracy of determining the displacements of the picture fragments belonging to
the four selected sections was then estimated. The values of the mean square er-

on identification of fragments of the underlying surface.

The values of the areas of identified fragments at which the curves are minus de-
pend on the information properties of specific fragments and vary randomly. These
curves can sometimes have two aaximme, which is explained by inclusion of new

[mart] A number of acoustooptical devices for processing optical and radio signals
has recently been developed, for example, on the basis of colinear acoustooptical
interaction, nultibackground bragg scattering of light and so on. Along with this
investigations of yet another new class of devices are being conducted which utilize
nonlinear interaction of elastic waves. Developnent of these devices was deternined
by the appearance of materials with high coefficient of acoustooptical quality and
high elastic nonlinearity.

The results of experimental investigation of a number of acoustooptical devices
based on colinear nonlinear interaction of voluaetric elastic waves are presented
in the article.

1. The operating principle of nonlinear acoustooptical devices (am) is based on
scattering of a lminous flux impinging on a sound conductor on an elastic wave
generated by two initial elastic waves propagated in a sediun with elastic nonlin-
earity. Let us consider in more detail the case of colinear interaction of elastic
waves during propagation along an acoustic axis.

As is know, in this case one of the elastic waves is longitudinal and two others
are transverse. me two waves 1 and 2 excited in the sound conductor generate a
third wave 3 upon interaction if the conditions of synchronise are fulfilled

where f; and K1 are the frequency and wave vector of the i-th wave. If condition
(1) is fulfilled, eight types of interactions are possible [1] which have per-ute-

tional symetry in the sense that the two longitudinally selected waves interact
and generate a third wave.

One can show that in the absence of attenuation (01 - 0), the outputs P1 of para-
netrically related elastic waves are determined by elliptical Jacobean functions.

Relations (3) and (4) permit one to detenine the amplitude of the generated elas-

If the initial waves 01 and 02 are pulsed signals whose length is short compared to

the travel time of elastic waves through the sound conductor, then amplitude 03 is
determined by the formula

i.e., it has an integral of the correlation or convolution type.

It is obvious from relations (3)-(S) that AND permit one to realize the shift of
two signals, their correlation and convolution, and also the controlled delay of a
radio signal with simultaneous introduction of the received information into an op-
tical system for further processing.

waves that, as can be seen from (2) and (S) , permits one to increase the efficiency

of the device and also to operate in a wide fnquency band which is determined upon
fulfillment of conditions (1) only by the piezotransducer band. This circmstance
determines a umber of characteristics in manufacture of acoustooptical cells for
Me

It is known that the amplitude and frequency characteristics of acoustooptical
cells are considerably dependent on the method of attaching the pierotransducer to
the sound conductor. As shown by calculations [2], the highest working frequency
bands are realized when the transducer is attached to the sound conductor by metal
binding layers. The cells used in the given paper were manufactured by a specially
developed technique and the transducers were attached by the thermos-passion me-
thod by copper-indium binding layers [3] .

The process of manufacturing the acoustooptical cells reduced to the following main
operations.

Sound conductors of PbMoOa and Ga? and transducer plates of LiNb03 were initially
machined by optical grinding and polishing methods. In this case the nonparallel-
lism of the transducers and edges of the sound conductors to which the transducers
were attached did not exceed 1 micron. After chemical cleaning in toluene and iso-
propyl alcohol, layers of metals that served as the binding layer in attachment of
the transducers to the somd conductors and also as one of the transducer electrodes
were applied to one of the ends of the sound conductor and to one of the sides of
the transducer by the thermal vacuum spraying method. Moreover, in our case sub-
layers of chromium that ensure adhesion of the subsequent metal layers, copper and
then indium, were sprayed on. Spraying the copper improved the conductivity of

the binder layer at high frequencies. The thickness of the sprayed copper and in-
dium layers was such that an approximate weight ratio of 60 percent copper and 40
percent indimn was provided and in this case the thickness of the indim layer was
approximately equal to one-fourth the wavelength of ultrasound in indium on the
central modulator frequency. The transducer plate was then attached to the sound
conductor by the thermocompression method. It should be noted that the piesotrans-
ducers were attached to opposite ends of the sound conductors simultaneously. More-
over, the ends of the sound conductors to which the transducers were attached were
not polished to improve adhesion during manufacture of lead molybdate modulators.

The thickness of the piezotransducer was then brought up to the required thickness
equal to half the elastic wavelength in the transducer material with regard to the
electromechanical coupling coefficient. The process of manufacturing the accusto-
optical cell was completed by vacuum spraying of an upper electrode (Ti, Cu and In).
The manufactured cell was attached to a special support after which the transducer
electrodes were soldered through the transition contact surface to the contact of a

high-frequency plug.

The conversion losses measured by the echo pulse method comprised approximately
3-5 (18 per conversion for longitudinal waves and approximately 5-6 dB for shear
waves with regard to diffraction and dissiputive losses. The working frequency
band of these cells was equal to 30-40 percent with electric matching of the imped-
ance of the transducer and power supply circuits.

3. Let us dwell further on the results of experimental investigations that we con-
ducted on an mu based on acoustical collinear interaction in lead molybdate and gal-
lium phosphide crystals.

a. Lead molybdate crystal mixer. Lead molybdate has the highest elastic nonlin-

earity for longitudinal acoustic waves propagated along a fourth-order axis in one
direction. The variance diang for degenerate colinear interaction of longitud-

inal waves is presented in Pigure l. the laws of conservation of energy and pulse
(1) are identically fulfilled in this case and consequently mixing will occur for

any pairs of initial wave frequencies. For the selected configuration of interac-
tion the parameter of nonlinearity is equal to [l].

The sound conductor had dimensions of 8 x 9 x 23 m with longest length along the
[001] axis. The piezotransducer operated on frequencies from 80 to 350 ml: and en-
sured acoustic output density up to S w/aaz (the dimensions of the upper electrode

were 1.2 x 5 an).

Nixing was investigated on the following frequency pairs f1 and £2: 80 and 320,

115 and 320, 150 and 320 and 320 and 320 an: in the continuous mode using modulation
of one of the input signals with frequency meander of 1 kHz. A photodetector re-
corded the light intensity I3 scattered on the generated wave with frequency £3.

The dependence of intensity 13 on the length of interaction of initial waves x is
presented in Figure 2 for different levels of input power P. The contributions of
sequential scattering, the nonlinearity of the piezotransducer and spurious har-
monics of SR? generators which did not exceed several percent were subtracted when
plotting the experimental curves. The extreme nature of the curves was determined

by the presence of elastic wave attenuation.

For quantitative analysis of the mixer parameters, let us select for examle the
case of mixing of frequencies f1 - 320 MHz, f2 - 115 an: and f3 - £1 + f; I 435 m.
In the case when acoustic output of initial waves comprises P1 3 P; = 100 w, we
find from (3) and (4) P3 2 5 an, i.e., the relative efficiency of the acoustic mixer
is equal to P3/P1 + P; z 2.5 percent. The effectiveness of light scattering on the
acoustic wave f3 comprises approximately 1 percent. which is in good agreement with
the experimental analysis. As can be seen from Pigure 2, effective mixing is ob-
served over a wide frequency band which is limited only by the piesotransducsr band-
pass. In this case the effectiveness of mixing increases with an increase of input
signal power and frequency, whereas there is an optimum length of initial wave in-
teraction due to attenuation.

b. A gallium phosphide crystal correlator. Nondegenerate interaction of acoustic
waves propagated in opposite directions along the [111] axis of a as? crystal (class

The acoustic output densities created by the piezotransducers reached 5 tiles:2 with
dimension of the upper electrode of 1.2 x 6 In.

An optical diagram of light scattering on the generated wave is presented in Figure

Q exceeded the value Q - 10. The point of iapingenant of the light beam on the
crystal was selected so that the acoustic pulse with frequency f2 intersected it
first. After this pulse f2 and pulse f1 delayed by tug - ll microseconds, inter-
act to the left of the optical beam and generate an acoustic pulse with frequency
f3 which is propagated to the right at velocity vs and intersects the optical beam.
The oscillograms of the input pulses and the correlation signal are presented in
Figure 5. The length of the correlation signal is equal to ‘r - 2 microseconds by
the level of half power. The maxim signal is recorded at moment of time t s 16

quency f2 is started. The effectiveness of light scattering on the generated wave
comprised 10"2 to 10’3. The values of the nonlinearity parameter 1‘, whose analyti-
cal expression for the used configuration of interaction has the following form.

direction of acoustic waves indicates the possibility of developing these devices,
which have the special main characteristics:

the radio signals are precessed in real time over a wide frequency band de-

the viewpoint of developing devices that operate at hypersonic frequencies;

the use of nonlinear acoustical interaction does not deteriorate the dynamic
range of optical information processing systems since the dynamic range of acoustic

processes themselves, determined by very weak thermal noise in a solid, comprise
approximately 90 dB [1):

the generated acoustic signal is read by an unsplit light beam or a beam
focussed at the point of tapping; consequently, the aperture of the first lens in
the optical system of the mu is small and is not dependent on the dimensions of
the sound conductor, whereas ordinary acoustooptical devices require a collineting
systu with lenses whose dimensions exceed those of the sound conductor:

the use of an mu makes it possible to simplify the arrangement of the pro-
cessing syst- for achieving convolution or correlation of signals compared to
acoustooptical devices ordinarily used:

universal materials now used, for example, such as lead nolybdate, gallium
phosphite, paratellurite and so on. can be investigated for development of W.

'I'ne indicated characteristics permit one to conclude that acoustooptical devices

based on collinear nonlinear acoustic interaction will find their place in a nusber
of radio signal processing devices.

[Text] Introduction

The concept of functional space L23 [1, 2] is used extensively in the theory of
analog devices for processing continuous causal signals with limited energy. Its
application specifically permits one to select the criterion of comparison (the
measure of proximity) of signals shaped by real devices (real signals) and the sig-
nals of ideal devices (ideal signals).

This criterion can be used to analyze linear distortions of signals in acoustoopti-
cal devices. 'ihey may include distortions determined by attenuation of high-fre-
quency elastic waves in an acoustooptical interaction nediun at low levels of input
signals.

These distortions of signals in an acoustic light modulator (ans) and or output sig-
nals of correlation analysis acoustooptic devices (ma) are considered in this

paper .

Let us limit ourselves to the case of relatively narrovband signals, practically
complete information about which is contained in their complex envelope.

Let us use as a measure of proximity of real and ideal signals normalized Euclidean
metrics [3] determined by the relation

The Signal in the ms

It has been accepted to characterize attenuation of elastic waves in an acoustoopti-
cal interaction median by frequency-dependent coefficient a (up). It is specifically
taken into account in the electroacoustical transfer coefficient of the ANS intro-
duced in [4. S] . This coefficient characterizes the frequency properties of the A315
and establishes the clear relationship between the spectra of the input electric

signal and the instantaneous spectra: of the spatial frequencies of an elastic wave
packet (space-tine signal) in the modulator aperture.

Relations that determine the signal shape must be found to estimate the distortions
in the Alas.

Let us assume that the ANS aperture (Figure l) is sufficiently large (greater than
the length of the elastic wave packet). The space-tine signal in this aperture,

corresponding to the input electric signal s(t), can then be represented in the fol-

Conclusions

Attenuation of elastic waves leads to distortions of the signal envelope in an ms
and distorts the shape of the output signal of the awn. Hon-rever. it hardly af-
tects the phase characteristics of the couple signal envelope in the aperture. The
distortions related to attenuation of elastic waves are linear and determine the
instrument errors of the devices considered in the paper.

The given graphs link the normalized mean square error to the value of no; (or am).
They permit one to select an acoustooptic interaction medium (material of the light
and sound conductor of the AMS) by the permissible value or this error. Por exam-
ple, if it is required that AﬂAgmu < 10 percent, then 002 < 0.2. One can then
select material in which to; < 0.2 under these conditions for given values of tul
and tug (and consequently T2 as well [5]).

The method of analyzing the distortions determined by elastic wave attenuation pre-
sented in this paper can also be used in analysis or other acoustooptic devices.

[Text] An acoustooptic correlation device (A01!!!) in which a low level of input
signals was suggested, was analyzed in [1, 2]. In this case acoustic light nodu-
lators (MS) can be regarded as linear devices with respect to the input effects
that carry out "linear” input of information to be processed in the optical systen.

At high levels of input signals. the shape of the space-time signal in the sound
conductor of an ms remains unchanged (if the distorting effect of elastic wave at-
tenuation is not taken into account). However, the modulating effect of this sig-
nel is such that would occur if there were a distorted signal in the ANS (a signal
with nonlinear distortions). Thus. nonlinear input of information to be pracessed
into the optical system occurs. It is obvious that the principle of wpemsition
is not applicable here.

As is known, the nature of nonlinear distortions will be different with different
input signals. The problem of analyzing these distortions is most simply solved
for narrowband input signals.

Determined nonlinear vector models of an AOKU with narrowband input signals are
found in this article.

It is shown in (l, 2] that . light wave with man-Nat diffraction after the second
acoustic light modulator of an AOKU is determined by the relation

[Text] In the conputer center of the Volgo-Vyatskoye mu Territorial ammun-
tion of the USSR Gossnab the problem "Settlenents With Suppliers“ has been worked
out and introduced into the Association "Volgovyatnashelﬁtrosnabsbyt."

The solution of the problem is based on informtion about the actually arriving
goods, the bulk of which is created during recording of the movement of production
and packing. and on information arriving froa the bank about pay-ants.

Invoices of suppliers which have arrived in the association accounting office
through the bank or by mil are grouped according to the collodity divisions func-
tioning in the association. Workers of the connodity divisions verify that the
data of the supplier's docunents latch all the conditions of delivery. accept
invoices of the supplier and write up arriving orders. In accordance with the
data on the goods which have actually arrived, the inconing order is printed on
"Zoyentron-393' mchines with perfmtor accessories in the electronic billing

machine unit. The prepared punched tapes are transmitted daily for processing on
a "Minsk-32" computer.

The accounting office transmits the verified and accepted invoices of suppliers
to the computer center.

To make the settlesents and print outgoing statements the daily lass of invoices
monitored and forsulated on mgnetic tape is used. as are the daily use of the
arrival of goods by invoice itens. the starting balances at the beginning of the
month and the reference intonation ”Characteristics of Supplier alter-prises."

The starting balance at the assent the task was introduced is entered from the
6-811 order register. The daily and nmthly records of settlelents with suppliers
are nude in a cross-section of each warehouse section and conodity division. The

results of the settlements node with suppliers per-it having data each day from

in accordance with the credit and credit account 60 in accordance with the debit
of the accounts; credit the balance at the end of the month for account 60. credit
for unbilled deliveries and debit for “goods in transit."

After the processing of data with a special complex of programs the information
about the arrival of goods and invoices is grouped in output statements: the in-
voice register. the stateaent of the arrival of goods. the statement of settlements

with suppliers for warehouse deliveries. the statement of “goods in transit" and
unbilled deliveries.

Computer solution of the problem contributed to increase of the effectiveness of
monitoring settlements with suppliers for each invoice. the adoption of effective
measures for the timely arrival of “goods in transit“ and "unbilled deliveries" and
the timely and reliable obtaining of accounting data asmring the synthetic and

analytical recording of settlements with suppliers both for the association as a
whole and for subdivisions.

Bureau of ”Refteprodukt' a second line of a package of applied progrms has been
created. one assuring the processing of sets of data on direct—access equipment
(PPP "RIP-2456") under the control of a Yes operating system.

The RIP is charactea". zed by a traditional approach to data processing. in advan-
tage of the method of discrete sets consists in more rapid results than with an

integrated approach (data banks). and a shortcoming is the fact that the creation
of different sets which include different intonation on the same objects and mke

use of information from different sources can lead to inconpatibility and mutual
non-equivalence of the data.

The RIP uses a mgnetic disk store for basic storage and data processing and lag-
netic tapes for long-tern storage.

The methods of processing sets assure rapidity. precision and completeness of data
retrieval. reliability, simplicity rnd convenience of operation and the ordering of
infomtion in the absence of careiul external sortings.

The RIP represents a complex of programs, a language of user-RIP interaction and
RIP data sets.

The programs permit formulating, correcting and opening up consecutive-index sets.
looking up and reading RIP intonation. etc. They use the entire RI? and OS arsen-

al foroptim perfomnce of input-output operations and the discovery. analysis
and location of possible errors.

The language of user-RIP interaction is a set of concepts. agreements and. rules

which permit receiving and renewing intonation of data sets. looking up and issu-
ing the necessary inforlation and analyzing the arising situations.

[Text] The introduction of sanctioned access to data in the USSR Gossmb Inform—
tion System_ was stipulated by the need to limit the oircle of users of the system.

Sanctioned access permits putting in order the obtaining of inquiries a: various
problems and protecting information stored in the system.

to the system the user must present hilself with his identifier and password. which
are then verified in the list or system users and. if they are not present there or
do not correspond with one another. the attempt to enter the cysts. is denied.

Each user is given the right to change his password as desired at any time. The
identifier is ﬂanged only by the especially selected person.

0n the data level. protection is accomplished in the following Banner. The manage-
ment establishes a list of problems accessible to each user. and within each task
the degree of competence or the user is determined. that is. the working conditions

Sanctioned access assures three levels of access to data and progress of the infor-

mation system the chief dispatcher level, the level of the central apparatus user
and the special level.

The chief dispatcher level permits having access to an inforution in the system
only in the date. reading lode. except intonation of the special level. The level

of the central apparatus user pmits raving access to reading and recording of
intonation on tasks permitted to each specific user. The special level per-its
having access to individual infarution only to the user himself with additional
passwords for a speciﬁc task.

The introduction of sanctioned access will per-it excluding unqualiﬁed access to
the system, putting intonation renewal in order and uniting the circle of users
for each specific task. which is necessary in collective-use cysts-s.

[Text] The task "Farming and issuance of certificates of the 10st ilportant lines”
has been developed and introduced into industrial opemtion wittdn tin fralework of
the first line of the USSR Gossnab Information Systel. The task was accelplished
on a ninicoaputer and is intended to inplenent monitoring during .the introduction
of capacities into operation during the course of construction and equipping of the

most ilportant lines of enterprises for mineral fertiliser production. The task is
solved monthly.

The complex of ainicolputer prograns per-its Ionitoring up to 500 lines for 30 in-
dicators. The indicators include the introduced capacities for each line. the

volumes of capital invest-ants and construction- and installation work. the nuabers

of workers, the delivery of raw materials and supplies. the delivery and installa-
tion of equipnent and reinforced-concrete and metallic structures.

The volume indicator, deadline for putting in operation and the actually introduced
volume are kept track of for each capacity. An annual plan. a plan for the report
period and fulfilnent of the plan from the beginning of the year in an increasing
total are prepared for the retaining indicators.

Provision has been lads for two kinds of data input: automatic. i‘ron magnetic tape
obtained as a result of solution of the problen of deliveries of netslwork on.the
Yes co-puter. and manual, i‘ron docuaents and displays on video terunals. The con-

plex permits issuing documents in the form of reports fro: a video terminal on a
screen or printer.

There is the possibility of obtaining the certificate of a speciﬁc line on all the
mineral fertilizer lines in succession. starting free any one of then. and also
sumry data in a cross-section of contractor. custoaer, territorial organ or for
all mineral fertilizer lines. Two days were required for that work when it was

machine report received twice a nonth data are presented a: the debtor indebted-

ness of enterprises of the republic as a whole to GOssnsb, including to organiza-
tions subordinate to it.

To effectively provide the nenagemnt of Goeellab of the republic with brief infor-
nation about the debtor ind ebtedness of linistrles (departments) in 1980 the Repub-
lic Computer Center of the Azerbaijan 88!! Cossnab developed and introduced a draft
of the task "Foundation of effective reference intonation on the state of debtor

indebtedness of commute of the republic to organizations of the Azerbaijan 88R
Cossnab" with the use of ninicolputers.

The input information of the task is the Incline report “Report on the rec
of debtor indebtedness," obtained on a "Musk-32" computer. In addition. the

directory of the ministries (departments) is used as nomtive-reference inform.-
tion in solving the tadt.

The output information is "Inquiry about the state of debtor indebtedness of con-
sumers of the republic to organizations of the Azerbeiﬁn 83R Gossnab." The in-

quiry is printed on an alphanuneric printer and the conclusion of the inquirer on
a display screen.

The task is solved by means of a program working in five nodes: data input. print
out of the inquiry on an alphanumeric printer. print out of the inquirer of Iinis-
tries on an alphanueric printer and readout of the inquire:- on a display screen.

[Tex-t] In the Republic Celputer Center of the Azerbaijan 333 Gosenab a couplex of
tasks "AutoIated record-keeping and selection of personnel in the Goeenab of the
republic (the min territorial addnietration)“ has been developed.

The complex of tasks is being planned on the basis of the Yes-1022 colputer with
the use of the algorithuic languages PL/l and m.

The complex of tasks is intended for the centralized collection of intonation
about workers of the territorial organ at the oonputer center. the fontim and
issuance upon request of inquiries on positions and workers satisfying deﬁnite
requirements: the conducting of an analysis of the mainstion and podtion struc-

ture of the odainietratim and the conducting of an analysis of. the ooapoeition and
movelent of personnel.

The analysis is made on the basis of featuree determined in a survey.

The analysis of tasks is planned with consideratim of the following require-onto:
standardization of the report docunente on peremnel; the creation of a peremnel
infomtion retrieval system the application of union-wide claeeifiere in the
formation of a vocabulary fund; standardization of achine reports for-ed as a
result of solution of the teak.

To solve the couples: or task report machine-oriented documents are introduced:
Worker's report cud." “Porn for taking oranges in worker's reported character-
ietios" and ”For. for change in uorkere' positions." as the available report '
docunente are not adapted to computer processing. In the development of the in-
tonation retrieval eyetel proviedm has been nde for the possibility of adjust-
in; to the varying structure of the machine-oriented started docuaente.

To realize the algorithl for obtaining the output machine reports. provision hae
been made for the growing of all the starting informtion into three data bases:

taining the necessary intonation about woﬂters excluded fro. the official list
(in that case the "Archive” is subdivided into short-ten and long-ten) and in-

quiries necessary to obtain the output mchine reports (continuous and one-tins
inquiries).

The content of specific output machine reports is determined by the content of the
conesponding inquiries. The output mchine reports are used by personnel sub-
divisions for the colpilation of statistical reports and inquiries about persamel,
and also the analysis and adopting of woman decisims on personnel ques-

[Text] The task of analysis of standardized working capital and standardized cur-
rent assets has been developed and introduced into the min Colputer Center of the
USSR Gossnab. The task consists in the conposition of a coupler for analysis of
the indicators of financial activity of the subenten of planning and financial

activity of the USSR Gossnab ASU. Data are processed and the output documents are
issued on a Yes-101:0 conputer.

The win software of the task is a data base which asmres the input. storage. re-
newal, checking and correction of dictionaries and files.

Tasks of analysis are solved on the basis of accounting records. which are entered

quarterly in the data base of the subsyste- of planning and ﬁnancial activity of
the USSR Gossnab A80.

The thin indicators according to which the standardized working capital is analyzed

are: equipment (Soviet and imported). tutorials structures and low-valued objects.
accounts receivable. uncredited assets and above—quota uncredited assets.

A questionnaire is prepared with consideration of deviations of the actual balances
from the established standard of self-owned assets.

The result of solution of the problem is foraulated in a summary report on USSR
Gessnab organisations in a cross-section of the Iain territorial administrations.
the soyuzglavsnabsbyts and soyurglavkonplekts. the sossnabs of union republics and

other organisations. The report is prepared non the results for a quarter. a
half-year, 9 months and a year.

Introduction of the task permitted providing workers of the planning and financial

adninistration with reliable and tinely information about the financial situation
of the branch and made it possible to free workers fro- uncreative mnual data

processing operations and use the freed tine for more profound analysis of process-
es of tutorial and technical supply.

[Text] was: is being done in the USSR Gossnsb on the creation of a single state-
wide autonated intorntion systea for fuel supply. In 1979 the tiret line of the
systes was turned over to industrial operation by the min conputer Center of the
USSR Gossnab. The "Fuel" Intomtion System ('Toplivo' Is) is oriented toward the
accomplisth of functions of operative smitoring and analysis at the state of
mel deliveries to the national ecmony and effective tracking of tuel stocks in
industry. In it provision has been nde tor autontc-i processing at input and out-
put data. the preparation at controlling documents for decision-asking and an in-
teractive node of mn-collputer col-amicatim.

In the structure of the "Fuel” Intorution Systen the leading place ins been allot-
ted to a distributed data base which performs functions at data econ-nation, stor-
: ., renewal and retrieval necessary tor the solution of tasks in directory servic-
in; ot the administrative apparatus. prediction of fuel supply processes for my
days. operative analysis and regulation of the tunotions at suppliers in assuring
the fulﬁlment of fuel delivery plans. Realization of conceptions of the data bank
under the conditions 11‘ a system for control at the tuel supply of the national
economy proved possible only in conditions ot the distribution of both the intox-
nation itselt and ot its processing on hierarchic levels of administration.

In the "Fuel" Infmtion System practical verification ot the principle of dis-
tributed data processing has proceeded on the level at the control apparatus ot the
USSR Goasnab. At the Central Intonation Point of the USSR Gossnab lain Computer
Center. on the basis at uniconputers a colputer group has been toned which is
intended for porter-once of operations ot collection of primary intention in the
system. Questionnaires are issued to the administrative apparatus by the oosputsr
group located in the section for monitoring tuel deliveries to the national econ-
ony. The interconnected work at those groups neared the develop-ant and intro-
duction at 13 tasks of the first line of the “Riel“ Intermtion Systea. The coupo-

[Text] A task of analysis of trade turnover. incones. distribuuon coats and
profits of USSR Gossnab organizations Ins been developed and introduced in the Main
Colputer Center of the USSR Gossnab within the franewoﬁ: of the subsysten of plan-
ning and financial activity of the USSR Gossnab A30. The task is included in the
conplex of tasks in analyzing indicators of ﬁnancial activity. The conputations
are made on a Yes-101:0 computer.

The starting infomtion for solving analytical tasks is taken fro: the data base
of the subsystem of planning and financial activity of the USSR Gossnab. The data
base. in turn. is fomd from quarterly accounting reports.

The rain indicators of trade turnover in the syste- of computer calculations are:
wholesale sales (total); sales of goods ex warehouse; sales of goods through
stores; sales of goods directly from producer to consumer with and without parti-
cipation in the computations; release of goods within the systen ex warehouse and
direct from producer to consumer with participation in the colputations; sales and
release of materials. work and services.

The analysis is made on the basis of the following incone indicators: fron sales
of goods ex warehouse, through stores. directly from producer to consular with and

without participation in calculations. incones from release of goods through the
system incomes fro- other sales; total income.

The data of tasks of analysis of trade turnover and incones of USSR Goesnab organi-
zations are used in solving the task of analysing costs and profit.

The rain indicators of costs and profit are: expenses of warehouses. bases and
stores; transportation expenses; expenditures on delivery and shipment of goods:

warehouse expenses. non-productive expenses: expenditures of organisations subor-
dinate to the USSR Gossnab: profit fron sales.

development and increase of the efﬁciency of automated control systems in railroad
transportation? provision is ends for the creation in 1980-1982 in the min direc-
tions (west-east, above all) of automated systems for operative control of the
operational work of railroads--systens new in principle. based on infer-tics: :
arriving from primry sources. which permit reﬂising not only a referral mode but
also the solution of problems in planning and predicting work indicators. the op-

' unatim of various prooesses and interconnection with the ASU of line enter-
prises and the Ministry of Railroads. As a result of pro-planning developments by
the Planning. Design end-Technological Bureau (me) of am, the VRIIth (A11-
Union Red Banner of Labor Scientific Research Institute of Railroad Transport), the
computer centers of the Belorusskaya, attyabr'skaya, Yugo-Zapednaya. Yuma-Urn?-
skaya, Sverdlovakaya. Gor'kovakaya and Vostootmo-Sibirskaya railroads, the tech-
nical task for such an ASUDO-D system has been devel and approved by the lin-
istry of Railroads (No a-2657, dated 23 January 1979 .

In the process of pre-planning investigation a basic list of functional problems
to be solved was determined, and also a list of the starting date for their reali-
nation, the information was systentized and infomtional messages were lads up
assure the solution of 90 percent of all the tadts of the system missing informa-
tion is entered by means of special aessages. The Iain distinctive feature of all
the messages is that they were developed on the basis of unified requirements for
their structure in order to assure generality of the technology of work with then
on all levels and processing in computer centers by means of unified standard pro-

gress. In the creation of the system the requirement of a single input of infor-
mation was oburved.

The system being developed consists of two parts. The general system part of
moo-n envisages the collection of necessary information. its input into the com-
puter. monitoring and correction. the formtion of general and specialised data
bank files. and the fomtion and issuance of results to users by standard means.
The practical part of the system ilplements procedures for the solution of func-
tional problems; in that case it is assumed that all the inforntion (both vari-
able and normative-reference) is present in the computer in a form prepared for the
given problem.

Division of the system into the general systu and practical parts permits greatly
reducing labor expenditures on program development. as input-output procedures are
worked up once (analysis shows that the wodning up of those procedures for an
individual problem omissM-hﬁ percent of the total labor expenditures) and
nkes possible parallel elaboration of both parts. which leads to a curtailment of
the total times required for creation of the system.

The actual system for control of the operatimal work on the railroad level is
limited in its possibilities by facilities for the mnual collection and processing
of primary information. whichdo not provide the urgency. reliability and complete-
ness of data on the entire variety of operational events on the monitored sections
of railroads which are necessary for the development of both parts.

The limitations are reduced basically to the following:

«the periodicity of the obtaining of basic data for control of the transport pro—
cess (freight car pools. rolling stock translisaion over link-up points. loading.
unloading. train position) is limited in operational reporting to days and in dis—
patcher reports and summries to half-days;

«forecasting of nature work and possible difficulties. especially for 2-3 or more
days, in the unual variant is practically impossible due to complexity in the col-
lection of the information needed for that and the need to use as a basis in cal-
culations a large number of mutually inﬂuencing factors in short periods:

«the impossibility of accomplishing in the existing control system effective mon-
itoring of the state and dislocations of individual units of the rolling stock
(refrigerator units. self-contained refrigerator cars. transporters. etc);

--the presence. during the monitoring of observance of the established technology
and standards of operational work. of labor-intensive work with nnual selection
of individual data. which on the whole does not give a complete characterisatim
of the situation. This applies. for ample. to monitoring violations of the plan
for formtion and shipping by directions. the provision of shunting yards with com-
plete lists by telegral of all trains arriving for break-up. to monitoring of their
quality. etc.

The main purpose of the development and introduction of the ASUDO-D is the elimin-
ation of those limitations: the assurance on that basis of the necessary effective-
ness and completeness of data characterizing the operatimal situatim on the rail-
road; reduction of the time required for estimating the production situatims by
operations workers and help in decision making by them: reduction to the time for

bringing the results of a decision to executives: efficient and operative monitor-
ing of execution.

Hith consideration of distinctive features of the transportation process the
ASUDO-D list:

«process and present to wagers of various ranks a large quantity of accounting
and report data as compared with the standard and planned tasks;

«organize data characterizing the general operating situation on large sections
with consideration of the interconnection and dynanic interaction of controlled
and aonitored objects;

«assure the necessary effectiveness and depth of prinary information. the forecast-
ing of expected results of work for the purpose of timely prediction of possible
failures and tradring dislocations of separate categories of trains and types of

rolling stcdc.

To bring the system close to local conditions and assure informticn interactia:
of organs of control on various levels. provisions are nade. on the one hand. for
a differentiated approach to the selection of tadts. the form and content of the
primary dowments for each railroad by starting from its distinctive features and.
on the other hand. standardisation of the basic documents used for the exclunge of
data between subdivisions wtdch are participating in the process of decisim.

Those requirements detenined the set of standard complexes of tats which lust be
solved on the cannon information base with the use of the unified general systea
facilities ASUDO-D. The list of standard complexes. the sequence of their devel-
opment and organisation and the developers were determined by the coordination plan
of developaent of the system approved by the Ministry of Railroads.

All complexes of tasks are intercmnected technologically and with respect to in-
formation through the general syste- part of the ASUDO-Dwa unified coaplex of
hardware and a set of standard program and information nodules which acconplish
the collection of information and maintenance of a data bank on the transportation
process.

The system opens up fairly broad possibilities for ilprovement of the control of
nailroad operations. permitting railroad and section lanagement to obtain a com-
plete idea of the operating situation on monitored sections at moments close to
real time. To describe that situation to the user. the following analytical data
are presented:

«shift of the freight car flows--total exchange of the railroad and sections.
transfer of trains and freight oars over specific link-up points with the neces-
sary breakdown of the pool by structure and destinations;

--the presence. dislocation and state of locomotives of the operating pool by types
of traction and series on the sections and railroad. including turnaround sec-
tions. addition depots and monitored stations:

--the presence of locoaotive crews for freight aovement on tumarmnd sections and
turnaround points;

--loading and unloading for the railroad. sections. monitored statims and enter-
prises by types of freight and freight cars;

On border railroads. in addition. similar inforaation is issued about freight

cars with export. import or transit foreign trade freight. and stations near ports
and border stations are included in the monitored objects.

The possibilities of forecasting and operative planning of future work in the very
near future are being especially expanded. Here one can distinguish:

«forecasting train situations and operatimal events-abs feeding of trains and
locomotives to monitored railroad stations. train forntion and readiness to
ship free shunting yards trains with the attacrment of loconotives to then to
organise train work on railroad sections;

--forecasting the arrival of goods at monitored unloading and reloading points to

organise rhythmicity of the shipping work of ports. large freight stations and
consignee;

«forecasting fulfilment of the main indicators of operating verb-loading. unload-
ing. transfer of trains and freight cars, the loconctive requirements, the trans-

portation of local freight for various periods as the basis for daily-shift plan-
ning of the railroad's work;

«issuance of detailed information to operations workers about the train situation

on rail sections for 3-6-hour periods. including infomtion about asmned diffi-
culties in operational work and recon-endatime on their elimination.

The systen provides monitoring of the dislocation and state of individual categor-
ies of trains and separate units of rolling stod: and containers. determining the
location of each nonitored unit. its state, the type of freight being transported.
the tine of shipnent and arrival and the tracing of mmitored points, the execution
of freight and tecrmioal operations and qmlitative indicators of use (the tine of
finding en route and during loading operations. the route speed).

A number of practical tasks of the system persit amitoring the observance of tech-
nological discipline and adopting effective name to eliainate found violations,
contributing to normal conditions of operatimal wodu

«execution of the plan for the foraation of stations:
--assurance of the fomtion of full-weight and complete trains:
"observance of the established procedure for direction of trains in a circuit;

"performnce of regulatory taste with elimination of counterflows of freight cars
of the sane kind.

The ASUDO-D assures the issuance to operations workers of stations, sections and
rail administrations of a number of tectnological docusents for each train. All
results of conputations are cosbined by the referral system. which acconplishes the
necessary cosmnications with the user. Its work consists in preparation for the
railroad sanagenent of the basic services (loveaent. locosotive, freight. etc) and
the railroad sections of the corresponding information. reports, forecasts. etc.
In the first stage withinithe fraawork of the referral systen usury reports are
prepared in regulated conditions on aovenents and transport work. analytical reports
for rail administrations and sections and reports for trans-ission to the Main Cos-
puter Center of the Ministry of Railroads. In the second stage an interactive node
of functioning of the referral system is realized. with the possibility of issuing

the results of solutions of practical tasks of the ASUDO—D on displays at the
request of railroad workers.

software is based on the general-system. which performs general functionsnmput,

opment will permit considerably reducing the time required for thedevelopent and
introduction of a system, on the one hand. ad will permit standardizing the compu-
tational process in railroad computer centers. on the other. An example of that is
the development of the ASUDO-D system.

ASUZIﬂ‘ Hardware and Distinctive Features of Its Planning
Pages 28-32, 39-39

The planning of the hardware of the first ASU line was done by each railroad indi-
vidually. as the hardware products list was limited, the systens developed a: the
different railroads were poorly connected with respect to inforntion, the func-
tioning of tasks was accomplished in a padtage mode. and the exchnge of inform—
tion between the railroad computer center and the information points, as a rule,
did not provide for remote processing.

The ASUZHI‘ second line required a different approach to hardware planning. for the
basis here was problems to be solved in real time. an extensive hardware products
list requires the development of standard general-system software, and remote pro-
cessing is the basic regime of infomtion exchange. The close infomtional inter-
connection between the processing complexes of different levels required solution
of the problem of intemchine exchange. and on the scale of the network. the cre-
ation of a branch computer network. Another important factor which influences the
approach to tardware planning is the requirement of maxi-1m compatibility of the
process of primary document preparation with the obtained information on nchine
carriers.

All this taken together required a complex approach to the planning of the tectni-
cal baseui‘rom the information sources to the processing complexes. (h the other

The main requirements presented for I'm'dme complexes for station and Junctim
computed: centers are:

--the possibility of work in real tine and a developed systen of renote processing;

--the possibility of performing the functions of Ionitoring and control of techno-
logical processes:

--the possibility of increasing cotputational capacity.

These requirements are satisfied very colpletely by the Soviet Sli-Z conputer and by
the Yes-1010 and Yes-1011 of Hungarian origin.

In the Eleventh rive-Year Plsn it is proposed to conduct an erpea-inental operation

[Article: "In Celebration of the 75th Birthday of Add. Tikhonov"!

[Text] One of the greatest scientists of our time. Academician Andrey Nikolayevich
Tikhonov, was born on 30 October 1906 in the city of Gzhatsk in Smolenskaya Oblast

(now the city of Gagarin).

In 1922 Andrey Tikhonov finished secondary school as an external student and
entered the mathematics department of the physics and mathematics faculty of
Moscow University and in 1927 he completed the university and entered as a gradu-
ate student the Moscow University Institute of Hathematics.

A.N. Tilthonov has been s professor at Moscow University since 1936 and in 1937 he
was elected a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1953 Add.
Tikhonov was given the title of Hero of Socialist Labor and was awarded the first-
degree USSR State Prize. In 1966 AJI. Tikhonov was elected a full maber of the
USSR Academy of Sciences. lie was awarded the Lenin Prize in the same year. In
1976 A.N. Tikhonov became the winner of still another USSR State Prise.

At the present time Academician A.N. Tikhonov is the dean of the faculty of com-
puting mathematics and cybernetics at Hoscow University and heads the department

of computing mathematics in this faculty. The faculty was created in 1970 with

the very active and decisive participation of Andrey Nikolayevich. Andrey Niko-
layevich has been the unquestioned director of the faculty since the instant of its
creation. The development of the faculty of computing mathematics and cybernetics
over the last 10 years and the great achievements of the faculty's team in the area
of training a broad range of specialists and of constantly improving the efficiency
of scientific research have been constantly associated with the work of Andrey
Nikolayevich, who has directed the team's efforts at the solution of timely prob-
lems.

At the same time A.N. ‘l‘ikhonov is the director of the USSR Academy of Sciences
Institute of Applied Mathematics imeni H.V. Keldysh.

Andrey Nikolayevich was the initiator of the creation in universities of the Soviet

Union of faculties of computing and applied mathematics, where specialists are
trained not only in the area of studying mathematical models of various natural

science problems, but also in the area of computing complex software, automated

control and planning systems, and systems for processing the results of complicated
scientific experiments.

 

Andrey Nikolayevich 'I‘ikhonov

In beginning to characterize the creative scientific work of A.N. Tikhonov we
immediately note the quite extensive range of his scientific achievements. The
fundamental pioneering results in many areas of modern mathematics and its appli—
cations (topology and functional analysis, theory of differential equations,

13h

FIM!(HHHC1AL USI'ONLX

computing mathematics and mathematical physics, the construction and study of
mathematical models of various natural science problems) are those of A.N.
Tikhonov. A.N. Tikhonov has made an enormous contribution to the creation of new
scientific trends such as methods of solving incorrect problems, the automation

of scientific research and the development of systems for the automated processing
of the results of complicated scientific experiments. To this must be added the
fact that the creative scientific work of A.N. Tikhonov represents a distinct and
rather rare example of a combination of first-class achievements in the most ab-
stract areas of "pure" mathematics and the profound investigation of applied prob-
lems directly related to the requirements of practical work.

The earliest period of the creative scientific work of A.N. Iikhonov was devoted
to topology and functional analysis. As an 18-year-old youth Andrey Tikhonov ob-
tained his own first results-—a proof of the fact that any regular topological
space with a denumerable base is a normal space (and therefore also metrisable).
Two years after this the young scientist published the results which brought him
worldwide fame and which placed him among the outstanding topologists of our time.
First Andrey Nikolayevich formulated a definition of the topological product of
any set of bicompact spaces. In mathematics finding the correct definition rather
often plays a decisive role in the entire theory. Tikhonov's definition of the
product of topological spaces plays just such a decisive role in topology.

0n the basis of this definition A.N. Tikhonov proved that the product in his sense
of any set of bicompact topological spaces is also a bicompact topological space.
"Tikhonov topology," based on this definition, has firmly entered the arsenal of
fundamental concepts of modern mathematics. The topological work of Andrey Niko-
layevich is the foundation for all modern topology, for the theory of topological
groups, for the theory of dynamic programming and for a number of divisions of
functional analysis.

Then A.N. Tikhonov worked on the general theory of differential equations and on
studying problems of geophysics and electrodynamics which are important from the
application standpoint.

Prominent Topologist A.N. Tikhonov became a world-famous specialist in the general
theory of differential equations and in topical problems of geophysics and electro-
dynamics.

The first studies of A.N. Tikhonov on the theory of partial differential equations
were the result of his studying a number of topical problems in geophysics, in
particular, the problem of reconstructing the historical climate of the earth.

In studying these problems A.N. Tikhonov formulated and solved a number of funda-
mental general mathematicsl problems.

A striking example of the solution of such a fundamental general mathematics problem
is A.N. Tikhonov's study (1935), which has now become a classic, in which he found

in a specific sense the definitive conditions guaranteeing the existence and unique-
ness of a solution to Cauchy's problem for the heat equation.

These conditions, which consist of the requirements for continuity of initial
function u°(x) and of the existence of a limit

FOR‘OFFﬂ%a§.USE(MVLY

m [mo-rm "-‘o.

are now customarily called Tikhonov's conditions.

The ideas set down in this study by A.N. Tikhonov were developed in subsequent
years in studies by a number of soviet and foreign mathematicians (0. Vider,

0.A. Ladyzhenskaya, 0.A. Oleynik, LH. Gel'fand and G.Ye. Shilov, etc.). Then
Andrey Nikolayevich formulated and studied the inverse heat problem. He proved

the fundamental theorem that the solution, u(x, t) , of the heat equation in region
x > 0, -< t < t , is unambiguously determined from the assigned value of

u(x, to) - uo(x) , if only a single derivative of this solution is limited in terms
of coordinate.

Belonging to the same period of work is A.N. Tikhonov's fundamental study on the
congruence of regions for which the first boundary problem for the heat equation
and the Dirichlet problems for Laplace and Helmholtz equations are solvable in the
classical sense. Having determined the fundamental region as that for which the
individual problem is solvable in the classical sense, A.N. Tikhonov proved the
following three statements: 1) any bounded region fundamental for the heat equa-
tion is a fundamental region also for the Laplace_equation, 2) any region funda-
mental for the equation Au - Au - 0 with some A 3.0 is a fundamental region
for the equation Au - Au - 0 with any X 1 O , and 3) any region fundamental for
the equation Au - Au - 0 with any X 1 10 is a fundamental region for the heat
equation, too.

These studies by A.N. Tikhonov were continued in later years by a number of mathe-
maticians: In 1969 0.A. Oleynik and c. Tautts proved that the region fundanental
for the Laplace equation is also fundamental for a general second-order elliptic
function with sufficiently differentiable coefficients; in 1959 V.A. Il'in proved
that a cylindrical region is the fundamental one for second-order hyperbolic and
parabolic equations permitting the Fourier method any time when the cross section
of this cylindrical region is the fundamental region for a Laplace equation.

These studies by A.N. Tikhonov were continued subsequently by V.R. Nosov, 5.".
Ponomarev, A.A. Novruzov, etc.

Affiliated with A.N. Tikhonov'a cycle of studies on partial differential equations
is also his doctoral dissertation. defended in 1936, in which the concept of a
functional equation of the Volterra type was introduced and a study was made of the
conditions for the applicability of the method of successive approximations of
Picsrd and of the Cavchy-Lipschits method of polygonal approximations for solving
this equation. A number of problems for the heat equation were discussed as appli-
cations, in particular the problem of the cooling of a solid with emission from

its surface following the Stefan-Boltzmann law. These results of A.N. Tikhonov
were utilized considerably by v.6. Tescnkov in investigating the properties of the
surface of the moon.

Then A.N. Tikhonov constructed the strict mathematical theory of a thermocouple,
studied the influence of radioactive decay on the temperature of the earth's crust,

dovolupml llu- lhcuny ul ulcruumguetic methods of studying the mum's crust and
mantle (and, in particular, methods of prospecting) and provided theoretical
justification for using the natural electromagnetic field of the earth for ob-
taining a complete electrical cross section of the earth‘s crust.

Let us emphasize that in studying these problems a fundamental role was p1ayed_by
the problem, developed by A.N. Tikhonov. of the stability of inverse problems.

For the purpose of proving the uniqueness of the range of inverse problems con-
sidered, A.N. Tikhonov formulated and solved the problem of the possibility of

determining coefficient q(z) in equation u" + kq(s)u - 0 with the condition
u(°) - 0 from the assigned function

e

((0.1)
f(1)=——u(o. 1) -

He proved the uniqueness of the definition of this coefficient, q(z) , in a class

of complex values of spectral parameter A under the assumption of the piecewise
analyticity of. q(z) .

Now after the lapse of a number of decades it is impossible not to note that in
this cycle of studies by A.N. Tikhonov fundamental mathematical results were ob-
tained for the first time relating to the problem of reconstructing a linear dif-
ferential operator from the properties of its spectrum. These results preceded
the familiar studies of 1.". Gel'fand, “.6. Kreyn, B.H. Levitan and V.A. Harchenko.

A.N. Tikhonov completed a cycle of studies on electrodynamics in conjunction with
A.A. Samarskiy. Mention should be made especially of two studies. in the first of
which the general method of constructing a Green's function for a system of

Maxwell equations in a cylindrical region with a random cross section was validated,
and in the second the principle of a limiting peak value was formulated and stu-
died, i.e., the question of defining a unique solution. u(!) ..to the Helmholtz
equation in an unbounded region as the limit as t e - of the solution, u(x, t) ,
of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the wave equation.

These studies by A.N. Tikhonov and A.A. Samarskiy were continued in the studies of
A.G. Sveshnikov, 0.A. Ladyzhensksya, V.H. Babich and other mathematicians.

A.N. Tikhonov was also involved in studies of the mathematical theory of chemical
processes. in particular, studies completed in 1955-66 devoted to the dynamics of
sorption. The timeliness of these studies consists in the fact that they comprise
the theoretical basis for the design of various decontamination facilities, whose
importance has been increasing steadily in connection with the problem of environ-
mental protection. The mathematical model of this range of problems has resulted
in nonlinear systems of partial differential equations. Andrey Nikolayevich has
found precise analytical solutions for some of these problems and for other prob-
lems which are not subject to an analytical solution he has used the method of
combining numerical and asymptotic methods. At the present time this cycle of
studies is being continued successfully by A.V. Lukshin.

am. ‘l'ikhonov's great merit lies in the fact that he use the first to romance
and begin to study in 1948 the question of the behavior of solutions of systems of
ordinary different‘al equations with a perturbation with the highest derivative.
For systems of the type

%=f‘(l.g.r) (I=I.2.....n).

“1} =f,(i,g,z) (i= 1. 2. .m).

in which uJ are perturbations satisfying the condition 1: _1 5.. n.1 and are such
that as u r 0 there exists a limit to the ratio u + (unﬁt: (u) , Andrey
Nikolayevich provided a general formulation for the cdu y prdblem and established
the criteria upon the fulfillmnt of which solutions of the initial system tend
to the solution of the singular system as perturbations tend to zero.

These studies by A.N. 'i'ikhonov, which formed the bases of a scientific trend under
heated development at the present time—the theory of singular.perturbations-—have
been continued by his students and other mathematicians, among whom should be men-
tioned primarily A.B. Vasil'yeva and VJ. Butuzov, v.11. Volosov, Ye.?. Hiahchenko
and rum. Rozov, s.A. Lomov and many others. -

A.N. Tikhonov has also made an enormous contribution to the development of modern
computing mathematics and mathematical physics. Finite difference methods repre-
sent some of the most effective methods of solving boundary problems for complicated
systems of differential equations. A.N. Tikhonov in cooperation with A.A. Samarskiy
created the theory of homogeneous difference systems designed for solving classes

of problems definable by assigning only the type of differential equation and
boundary conaitions. They also formlated and proved the principle of the conser-
vatism of random homogeneous difference system as the necessary condition for con-
vergence of the system in a class of discontinuous coefficients. The theory of

h- z-ogeneous difference systems has received further development in studies by A.A.
Samarskiy and his students.

Characteristic of the creative scientific work of LN. ‘l‘ikhonov is the fact that
together with the intense study of fundamental mathematical problem he has formu-
lated and solved a number of problems which are of important national economic sig-
nificance. A great number of efficient algorithms for solving quite diverse prob-
lems in electrodynamics, geophysics, plasma physics, gas dynamics, the dynamics

of sorption and other fields of natural science have been created under his guid-
ance and with his direct participation and have been utilized in practice.

The team headed by A.N. Tikhonov and A.A. Samarskiy, as the result of studying the
process of the expansion of a plasma column in a magnetic field by means of methods
of mathematical modeling utilizing a computer, has discovered a new physical phe-
nomenon-«he formation of a high-temperature layer of plasma. which has been given
the name the "T—layer effect." This theoretically established effect. which has
been registered as a discovery, has subsequently received numerous experimental
confirmations.

One more of the most brilliant achievements of modern mathematical science belongs
to Andrey Nikolayevich-—the method, developed by hﬂs, of a firm solution to

broad classes of incorrectly formulated problems. These studies by A.“. Tikhonov
have defined a new trend in mathematics involving a fundamentally new approach to
the problem of utilizing mathematical models in natural science and engineering
problems.

In an immense cycle of studies (completed in 1963) A.N. Tikhonov singled out a
broad class of incorrectly formulated problems which he called regularizable.

For the purpose of solving these problems A.N. Tikhonov introduced the concept of
a regularizing algorithm and pointed out effective methods of constructing such an
algorithm which can be easily implemented on a computer.

Under the guidance of Andrey Nikolayevich the method developed by him, which has
been given the name "Tikhonov’s regularization method," has been used for solving
a great number of both fundamental general mathematics and timely applied problems.

The following problems in particular have been solved by the Tikhonov regularization
method: the problem of finding a solution to an integral and operator equation of
the first kind, inverse problems of the theory of potential and heat conduction,
the problem of the analytic continuation of a function, the problem of restoring
a function and its derivatives to a certain order from values of its Pourier co-
efficients perturbed in A , incorrect problems of linear algebra, a number of
problems in mathematical economics and the theory of optimum control, a number of
important inverse problems in geophysics, astrophysics and optical and neutron
spectroscopy, new problems in the theory of pattern recognition, and many others.
The application of a modern system of mathematics for solving incorrect problems
has made it possible to obtain a number of fundamental basically new results in
these timely problems of natural science and engineering.

Under A.N. Tikhonov's leadership a fundamentally new approach has been developed to
solving problems in the mathematical design of complicated physical systems, which,
in particular, has made it possible to obtain constructive methods of creating real
antenna systems for various purposes. The methods which have been developed have
made it possible, while taking into account restrictions on sources for exciting
the antenna and its structural parameters, to satisfy optimally the requirements
for its radiation characteristics.

0f great importance to the development of modern natural science have been A.N.
Tikhonov's studies relating to firm methods of solving inverse problems, to which,
as a rule, is reduced the interpretation of many complex scientific experiments,
and the development of the general principles for the creation of automated systems
for the complete mathematical processing of complicated scientific experiments.

A number of systems for automatically processing the results of physics experiments
have been created under the direction and with the direct participation of Andrey
Nikolayevich.

By means of these studies A.N. Tikhonov has created a new trend in mathematics
and has developed a fundamentally new approach to problems relating to the auto-
nation of scientific research. Recently methods of solving incorrect problems
have firmly entered the arsenal of modern mathematics and have been developed

trend that arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s and which has been named

"artificial intelligence“ is engaged in study of this capability.

It is difficult to overestimate the prospects which solution of this problem will
open up since man will have at his disposal a wise, dispassionate and accurate ad-
visor if he is successful. Wen more intriguing and promising is to supply compu-
ters with actuating members (mechanical arms) and to embody its advice into “mental“
actions of these members completely independent of man that are directed toward in-
telligent transformation of the real world. to realize these operations, a compu-
ter, by using special sensors, should be supplied with information about the real
world and by using man-machine ccenunication devices, should be supplied with in-
formation about the goals of operations. An automatic multipurpose system formed
by the interacting combination of a specially program-ed computer, mechanical arms,
sensors and comunication devices is also a system to which we connect the concept
"manipulator robot. "

Unlike other tools of labor developed by man until new, the robot is a tool of labor
of completely new quality. The capability of self-contained, purposeful “intelli-
gent" actions essentially creates the opportunity for these devices to reproduce
themselves and places them in an exceptional position.

It is of course still too early to talk at present about realizing these capabili-
ties of robots, but even those functional properties which they now have, based on
today's state of science and technology, make development of these devices very
timely. This is related to the fact that technical progress has very acutely posed
the problem of replacing man with a robot in performing jobs in a situation threat-
ening to human health (in space, the ocean and in aggressive media) and also simply
low-intellect, monotonous jobs.

The first generation of manipulator robots is now being used extensively in indus-
trial production where they replace people in performing stereotype auxiliary oper-
ations. These devices realize their functions successfully, true. only in a strict-
ly organized external medium when the objects of their actions are in specific,
previously known locations, which is typical for modern industrial production.

of course, these types of robots are totally unsuitable to perform a wide range of
j-'-bs in a loosely organized variational environment. And this use of robots ac-
quires ever more important significance and not only with regard to development of
the ocean and space, uhere an acute need for these devices is now felt. The fact
is that the real world is mainly a variational, indeterminate environment and ex-
pandin—g the areas of use of robots will inevitably be related to development of
this world itself, which requires development of multifunctional robots adapted to
diverse operations in it.

mere are two methods of solving the posed problun. The first of than assumes de-
velopment of an ”intelligent" robot that fully performs any problems posed to it in
a self-contained manner. The degree of intellect of this robot is determined by
the possible range of problems toward which it is directed. This method provides
a global, but extremely complex solution of the problem since we essentially do not
yet have at our disposal either the hardware, theory or even the design ideas that
permit one to count on development of robots in the near future that are similar in
their capabilities to the intellectual capabilities of man.

The second method is more realistic. It assues rejection of full autonomy of
robot behavior and is oriented toward specific interaction of man and robot in per-
forming the postulated task. In this case run utilises only his own functions
which he performs better than a computer. directly linked to a robot, could. This
control is called supervisory control from the word ”supervisor“ (controller). the
role of which man performs in the given case.

This method provides the capability of developing robots now with the required
functional properties designed to work in a complex indeterminate environment. At
the same time a convenient . practically viable capability of converting to design
of as: ”intelligent.‘ fully autonomous robot is established here by gradual transfer
of robot control functions ww performed by man to the computer, even up to com-
plete freedom of man from control. It is obvious that development of such in “in-
telligen " robot will depend largely on the overall progress in the field of com-
puter improvement and programing methods.

The known foreign literature devoted to consideration of this principle of robot
control (perhaps with the exception of [l9, 67, 104] and some others) is mainly
descriptive in nature. at the same time it is recognized in it that prospects for
expanding the areas of practical use of robots are related to supervisory control.
This circumstance was also the thrust toward writing the book in which the author
attempted to consider this question in as detailed a manner and as thoroughly as
possible. The author's own developments which he conducted at the Leningrad Sci-
entific Research Computer Center, USSR Academy of Sciences, coaprised a significant
part of the material.

The contents of the book can be divided into three unequal parts. The first of
them, which includes chapters 1-7, is devoted to the principles of designing multi-
level systems for control of the guided actions of the manipulator robot (decision-
making systems). by means of which the plan of robot behavior is autonomously
formulated on the basis of the goal posed to him by the human operator and with
regard to information about the characteristics of the real world delivered by the
robot sensors. Main attention is devoted to the principle of designing a decision-
making system based on methods of the classical theory of automatic control. This
is related to the fact that this principle perhaps corresponds to the greatest ex-
tent to the capabilities of practical robot control at the given phase of develop-
ment of supervisory control.

Problems of designing the typical functional robot system with supervisory control
--a communication system by means of which man and robot interact, are cmsidered
in the second part (Chapter 8). The apparatus and communication languages. in-
cluding the Vans input language developed by the author. are described in it.

The third part (Chapters 9 and 10) is devoted to problems of organizing calculating
processes with supervisory control of the robot, which includes interaction of
numerous robot software modules during functioning of the decision-making system.
entry of intonation from the robot sensors and also entry of instructional infor-
mation from the human operator.

The material of the book ccnprises the basis for a course of lectures "Robot Con-
trol Theory," which the author read at the faculty of Applied Mathematics-mud
Processes, Leningrad State University. With regard to this experience. the author
leads more specific the consideration of aconsiderable number of questions by intro-
ducing relevant examples, hoping that engineers who usually prefer this type of
exposition would be interested in the book.

In conclusion. the author feels it his pleasant duty to thank his colleagues V. A.
uchinov. s. I. Novachenho, V. A. Pavlov and A. A. nu'nin for active assistance
in working on the book.

He is also grateful to P. s. Petrov whose critical counts and advice and also
direct work on the manuscript helped to significantly isprove the style or outlin-
ing the material.

V. a. Ponouarev, 0. Ya. athotsiukiy and Ye. P. Popcv played a special role in the
history of the back. me book would probably not have cone to light without their
moral support, valuable advice and sincere interest.
