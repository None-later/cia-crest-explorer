SIEMENS EXPANDS 7800 SYSTEM "WARD WITH FUJITSU HODELS
Munich COHPUTBRHOCHB in German lo Dec 8l pp 1, 2

[Article: "Puj itsu 7.890 and 7.892 Models Announced as Top of the Line in Large
Fujitsu Computers"]

[Text] Munich (CH)--Siemens AG will expand their system 7.800
with Fujitsu's large 7.890 and 7.892 computers (CH No 47/81

p 1). According to the lhmich electrical concern, the current
largest model. the 7.892. has 15 times the capability of the
smallest Fujitsu machine, the model 7.865—2. Of interest to
those moving up in system software is the fact that with the
"Advanced Virtual Machine" (AW), comparable to 1814's super
tool VH/370 (Virtual Machine/370). several operating systems
can work simultaneously.

All models of the 7.800 family are compatible with the BS 3000, ms. Vii/37‘ and
VSl operating systems. The new 7.790/92 corputer can, according to Siemens. also
operate with the IBM systems mS/SPl and 2 as well as with the VH/SP release 2.

The capacity of the 7.890 single processor is about 2.5 times that of the model
7.880—2. until now the largest single processor of the 7.800 system. The primary
memory capacity ranges from 16 to 64 MB. The model 7.892-2 multiprocessor also
offers about 2.5 times the capacity of the model 7.882-2, until now the largest
multiprocessor. The main memory is expandable from 32 to 128 113. Both models can
be equipped with a maxim of 64 channels for s maxim processing rate of 96 MB
per second.

According to Siemens, the program throughput of the new models will be achieved
through the 3-level storage hierarchy: main computer, global and local buffer
memories. Pulse-counsnd control inproves bus management. Distributed micropro-
grems for controlling comand execution and arithmetic operations result in fast
access to the microprogram memories.

The L8! technology in the new models includes logic modules with a gate response
time of 350 picoseconda and memory elements with acquisition times of 5.5 nano-
seconds for the local buffer memory and 16 nanoseconds for the global buffer
memory. The main memory consists of 615-bit chips. The heat generated in the
chips is conducted away by small cooling channels.

The current version of the 883000 (BS3000 8&0) operating system has been expanded
by several functions, according to the Munich firm. Thus, with 2 gigabytes of
real addressable memory, the entire main memory can now be used for normal task

switching operations.

It can contain the executable code and the buffer and control blocks for input/
output operations and user data fields. Hith only a few exceptions, all address
locations of the expanded memory are available. Through stronger parameterization
of the likewise expanded system decision manager (SDH), heavily loaded systems can
be more readily optimized.

Additional software protection to prevent simultaneous alteration of stored data
sets by several systems is achieved with the software product DSISD (Data Set
Integrity for Shared DASD). The delivery date for these BS3000 expansions is
July 1982.

The new software product "Advanced Virtual Machine" (AVM) offers 7.800 users the
capability of employing several operating systems on a single computer at the
same time. In particular, AVM permits users who are presently working with an
IBM operating system on a 7.800 to convert stepwise to the BS3000. The current
system is operated in parallel with the BS3000 under AVH control. The VH/370,
DOS/VS, VSl and HVS operating systems can also be used with the BS3000.

The basic 7.890 configuration with 16 MB of resident memory and 16 channels costs
about on 8.1 million. The model 7.892 with 32 MB and 32 channels goes for DH 15
million. Also, Siemens is lowering prices for the 7.875—2, 80-2 and 81-2 by up

to 20 percent.

The first System-7.890 computer will be delivered in the spring of 1983. Siemens
has already sold 55 Japanese Jumbos, 1a for delivery outside the PRC.

ACIIVE MAGNETIC BEARING FOR VERY HIGH SPE- MACHINING
Paris AI 5 oosms in Ranch 12 Dec 81 p 31
[Article by Gerard Collin]

[Text] The program of development of suspension by scans of active magnetic bear-
ings has reached the preindustrisl phase. after having been started 15 years ago

by the team of LRBA [Ballistic and Aerodynamic Research Laboratory] and continued

by 53? [European Propellant Conany]. The 82!! company--a joint subsidiary of SE?
and SIG—which is now responsible for this program, believes. in fact, that the
market is beginning to respond significantly to the presentations and demonstrations
of prototypes sects-dated in France, Germany. the United States and Japan especially.

M markets seem to be directly concerned by the possibilities offered by the $2!
Actidyne active magnetic bearings: turning machines and machine tools.

Turning machines include medium-power machines. machines with large shaft lines

and cryogenic machines. 52!! has already achieved considerable success in this

area in the PRC and the United States. In the United States. for exanple, with

a centrifugal colpressor and Ingersol Rant (power: 6 m and at Delaval. The

EDP [French Electric Company] signed a contract for the development of two prototype
bearings now in process of delivery. A cold helium laboratory compressor has also
been put in operation at Air Liquids.

It is also noted that 82! has already produced 260 turbomolecular vacumn pulvps
00"“ bars, 30,000 rpm), whose advantage is not causing pollution of the vacuum
by lubricants and not causing vibrations. 82!! has also sold, in the ERG and Japan,
remachining pins. engraved printing cylinder pins and rolling mill cylinder rec-
tification pins.

T“ the field of aerospace--in which. we remind the reader. Actidyne was born—the
following applications are in progress:

The receiving stations for pictures from SEP's VIZIR satellite are equipped with
a film drum suspended by active magnetic bearings. The advantage is a lack of
friction. therefore. weak. constant couple. This makes possible an accuracy of
the drum's speed of rotation on the order of 10" and respect for micrometric ac-
curacy of printing of the film by laser (see illustration at end).
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

NASA has signed a feasibility study contract with 82)! concerning the Space Shuttle.
This study pertains to placing the turbo feed puns of the Shuttle's liquid hydrogen
and oxygen engines—therefore around -260°c--on active magnetic bearings.

For the Space Lab, this time. 82!! has studied vacuum pumps for the metallurgy even
under vsightlessness. The advantages are a lackof friction. therefore no cooling
and no vibrations, and machining at very high speed or ‘l‘GV [Very High Speed].

TGV Machining: Boeing and the Others

At a time when the authorities and industry are devoting attention to the case
of the French machine-tool industry. the Actidyne bearings should give rise to
much interest in machindng. Now. it must be observed that it really seems that
foreign aerospace industry will take first advantage of them. unless there is a
definite acceleration of the program in progress in France.

We have already described, in these columns, the French TGV machining development
program. See All & cosms number 875 page -- and page - especially.

He should point out that' this program is conducted primarily between 82!! for the

pins. RI'DO [expansion unknown] for the tools (carbide), m Forest for associated
machines and Dsssault.

After the first validation tests of the concept, 1141 Forest developed a testing
machine making it possible towork at high speeds of advance--30 meters a minute-4»:
on only one axle. The first tests on this machine have just taken place at Capdenac,
so that the first really industrial productions in the French aerospace field are
not expected in the innediate future.

At the same time. Boeing has decided to jm over all thepreliminary steps and
has placed an order at ‘rurchan for two machines with one head, 15 kH/five axles.
The first one is in operation at Wichita.

It seems at this stage that the French aerospace industry is finally follouing

up on this work only "very weakly." Horeover. although it can be believed that
IGV machining of light alloys has virtually been mastered in its principle (es-
pecially for a determination of associated tools). it seems that everything still
has to be done with regard to steels. The subject of TGV turning--a priori favor-
because of its high speeds of advance-«does not seen to have been tackled either.

Within the framework of the government program for recovery of the French machine-
tool industry, 82“ has proposed three subjects:

Continuation of Work in Light Alloys
Study of IGV machining of steels.
Sudies on TGV machining of "hard" composite materials. By this we understand mater-

ials of the carbon-carbon type (for aircraft brakes, for example) that are raising
serious machining problems at present.

There certainly is no cause for presenting TGV machining as a panacea for the
machine-tool industry and the aerospace industry. There are a number of factors
other than turning time that intervene in production costs. But. on the other
hand. TGV machining provides a productivity supplement that should even be able
to become significant in the case of special machinings: large parts (panels,
girders, masts), turning, "hard" composite materials, ceramics and so on.

Then, why not play this very French card to the limit!

 

$2M has set up, at Vernon. a demonstration of TGV machining simulated by a horizon-
:al 1athe—-making speeds of advance of 15 meters a minute possible--in a light
aeronautic A045 state T4 alloy. machined by an RITO tool, one tooth (brazed blade,
20‘ cutting angle. 25 millimeter diameter, blade sweep 23°, speed of rotation
54.000 rpm, 810-1000 (10 kW) pin. Result: 500 to 700 cubic centimeters a minute
removed. for a productivity of 70 cubic centimeters a minute per kilowatt.

 

Film support drum of SEP's VIZIR stations. Each picture consists of 15,000 15,000-
dot line, or 7-micron dots for a 900-meter resolution of terrestrial imagery. The
film carried on the drum is printed by laser. Engraving accuracy must make it
possible to superimpose several films with an accuracy close to e micron or better.
Drum positioning accuracy is, therefore, on the same order at rotation speeds of

1 to 20 revolutons per second. Drum weight: 22 kilograms. Mnty devices have
been delivered up to now.

A 310: FIRST FLIGHT, SALES, PRONGI‘IG‘ 301mm
Paris A1]? EI‘ cosmos in French 19 Dec 81 pp 22, 23. 25, 26

[Article signed J. H.: "Airbus Industrial Resolved to Expand its Product
Line to Increase its Share of the Market"; passages enclosed in slantlines
printed in boldfac_e_7

[17er A few months from the /A 310's first flight/, mjor executives of Air-
bus Industrial have presented to specialized journalists the new aircraft.
two of which are in the final stages of construction in shop H90 of Aerospa-
tiale at Toulouse St. Martin. The visit was also the occasion for a series
of presentations covering the whole range of production--present and future--
of the European consortium, and for reports on its comercial activity, in-
dustrial foundation, and position vis—a-vis other mjor world aircraft build-
ers. Never had Airbus Industrial gone to such lengths to inform journalists,
and it is out of the question in these few pages to publish even a summry
of the mass of informtiom so dispensed. Thus our readers will find in the
weeks to come substantial supplements to the present account.

Before proceeding to the A 310 proper, it is fitting to recall /order and
delivery figures/ for the /A 300-A 310/ line of products. At mid-December,
Airbus Industrial was still announcing /502 aircraft sold/ (32“ A 3003 and
178 A 3103) of which /3l+3 were firm orders (255 A 3003. 88 A 3103) and 159
were options/ (69 A 300s, 90 A 3103). The only difference lies in the fact
that one of the "non-announced" companies was actually Singapore Airlines,
which has just converted six A 300 options into firm orders, and taken two
A 310 options. The number of carriers who have officially ordered A 300s
thus still remains at 310. but the number of those who are acquiring A 310s
has risen from 13 to 11+. Taking into account those comapnies who have opted
for both aircraft at the same time, the total number of acquirers rises to
1+2, not including Air Algeria which has rented two A 310 810-100 from Luft-

We

Still at mid-December, Airbus Industrial had /dllivered 158 aircraft/ (#7
A 300 323, 111 A 300 M), with the number of operators rising to 2?. Thus
it still had /3‘04 Airbusses to deliver/, assuming all options are changed
to firm orders, which seems probable in most cases. To the 502 planes al-

7
ron carom. use om:
run orriulnn USE ONLY

ready mentioned, 5 can be added (3 A 300s and 2 A 3103) for which three firms
have already accepted proposals made by the consortium. To sum up, the grand
total would be /507 planes for hh firms/. Another interesting point in these
statistics is that Airbus Industrial has as buyers 18 of the 20 countries in

the world with the highest GNP; the two missing, obviously, being the Soviet

Union and the People's Republic of China.

Concerning /production/, it is freely recalled at Toulouse that Airbus Indus-
trial depends on four partners (Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, CASA [Empan-
sion unknowé7, and Deutsche Airbus, whose employees exceed 160,000, of whom
/H?,000/, or only slightly more than 10 percent, work for Airbus Industrial;
the margin for maneuver is thus very high. These work force figures are com-
parable to those of Boeing (81,000) and McDonnell-Douglas (70,000). More-
over, the geographical dispersion of the means of production among the four
countries constituting the birthplace of the European consortium is far less
than that found, for example, in the case of Boeing for the B 76? program,
even omitting the Japanese and Italian subcontractors.

The /production program/ curve, even if provisional, is interesting to com-
pare with the much more perturbed ones of American aircraft builders. /The
progressive rise in production rate remains an important economic factor/ in
the broad sense of the word: it will be /5# in 1982, 70 in 1983, and 88 in
198R/(that is, 8 planes per month for 11 months). Of course, that growth in .
production is matched by a very considerable investment effort: DH 600 mil-
lion in Germany, Fr #00 million for Aerospatiale (1980), Ptas 1,#50 million
for CASA, and about 30 million pounds sterling for British Aerospace (1979-
1982), as well as #0 million pounds sterling for additional tooling to raise
to 98 the annual production capacity for A 300 and A 310 wing assemblies,

not to mention the two Super Guppies already in process of manufacture, which
will raise to k the number of planes of that type used for fast and economi-
cal transportation from plant to plant of the bulkiest components.

In terms of the world market for aircraft of large carrying capacity, Airbus
Industrial modestly (I) shows for this year a /penetration rate of 5“ percent/,
thanks to firm sales of #5 A BOO/A 3105 as against 7 B-76?s (8 percent), 15
B-?#73 (18 percent), 8 L—1011s(10 percent), and 8 DC-10s (10 percent).

Still more interesting is the comparison of tocal 1981 sales (83 planes) to
1980 sales: for the same period, that of the first 11 months, total firm
sales were in fact 135 in 1980 (which clearly indicates the massing of sales),
but Airbus Industrial's part grew by 15 percent, to the detriment of all other
builders.

Finally, we note that Airbus Industrial has further enhanced its backlog of
aircraft to be delivered: in 11 months, this grew from 3k1 to 3h#/3h9. In
fact, delivery lags have become such that there is little chance of seeing
further growth in back orders, though the effects of the present bad situa-
tion are somewhat offset by those lags. To reach its set goal of 1,000 air-
craft, Airbus Industrial is striving above all to increase the number of its

8

customers, which increased in 11 months from 39 to 1+4. Broadening of the '
product line should facilitate that growth.

As was pointed out by Pierre G. Paineret, senior vice president for market-
ing of the consortium, the policy of Airbus Industrial is simple, and is de-

fined by three lines of action: to /meet demand, improve present products,
and broaden the product line/ so as to maintain a viable European industry.

"hence the studies now in progress (to which we shall return in future is-
sues), which are directed concurrently toward the "small" A 320, the large
capacity TA 9, the TA 12 (a long-range A 310), and the very long-range qua-
druple-Jet TA 11. The market, of course, will decide what priority to give
this or that program, it being accepted that the A 320 and TA 9 are front
runners in this race to development. For the A 320, discussions are now well
underway with Delta Airlines, but the number one problem remains that of the
very "advanced" engine indispensable to provide the aircraft with the best
possible economic foundation (see article p 15, this issue).

most important is that Airbus Industrial is now attaining true mturity in
terms of industrial tooling and technical-comercial policy/. In a word, the
European consortium has become "totally credible," and is calling the tune
to other major aircraft builders of the world, while negotiating as an equal
with engine builders and systems suppliers. Negotiations such as those now
proceeding with Delta on the A 320 are the best demonstration of that credi-
bility and stature.

To return to the A 310, we have seen at Toulouse /the first A 310/ (aircraft
no 162) practically finished, with its cabin floor occupied by many record-
ing devices, and now beginning its vibration tests with the aid of ONERA
Eational Office for Aeronautical Studies and Researcg. Technicians anti-
cipate the aircraft will be ready to begin flight tests by mid-March (the
target date is 31 March), provided of course that weather conditions are not

too unfavorable.

A 310 no 2 (airframe no 172) has now received its fin and awaits its engines.
Owing to the fact that it will not have to undergo the same preliminary tests
as aircraft no 1, it has some chance of catching up with the latter, although
the target date for its first flight is the end of April. Thus the second

A 310 could be ready to fly in March, and within optimum limits these two
prototypes could be capable of making their first flights the same day.

An interesting aspect of preparations for these tests relates to the use of
A 300 no 3 as a demonstrator of the EFIS [Electronic Flight Instrument Sys-
teﬂ, that is, the cathode ray tubes for piloting and navigational data dis-
play which are an integral part of the A 310 cockpit. Two Thomson-08F EFIS
have been in service since 8 December on A 310 no 3, thus saving precious
time in perfecting the A 310 thanks to the experience gained in flight.

The third A 310 airframe, marked for fatigue tests, will be "operational" as
early as April. /The third A 310 to fly/«this one ..‘Ith General Electric

CF6-80A turbojets--is intended for Lufthansa and bears serial no 191. It

will reach the final assembly stage in April, and will fly in late July or
early August.

The fourth A 510 (airframe no 201), also equipped with CPS-80‘ engines, will
fly in late September or early October. The fifth A 510 (airframe no 217),
equipped with Pratt and Whitney engines, will fly in late November or early
December. These last two aircraft will be rapidly fitted out for commercial
operation, but will also participate in the flight testing program, which
should make it possible to obtain /by the end of March 1983 the type certi-
fication for the two versions (Pratt and Whitney or General Electric engines).

Meanwhile, by August 1982 the airframe for static tests will have started
its ground tests.

Finally, we recall that integration of the A 510 into the comon A BOO-A 510
assembly line is planned for as early as next fall, in principle for the
sixth A 310 (approximate number ranking in series: 220). This will be a
delicate operation requiring rigorous balancing of time factors.

A 310: To 148 Tons?

Latest wind tunnel test results, at low and high speeds, with simulation of
engine installations, have shown that announced performance levels will be
attained, and thanks to various modifications made in the aircraft, they
even permit anticipation of still better performance at takeoff, in terms
of takeoff weight for a given 1e th of runway. Hith 257 passengers and
reserves of FAR [expansion unkn International type fuel, and cruising
at Mach 0.78 within an altitude range of 31,000 to 35,000 ft, the A 310
will have a range of:

/2,500 nautical miles/,or 45670 km for the basic A 310-200 version. with
mximum weight of 132 tons;

/3,0CC' nautical miles, or 5,550 km, for the "developped" A 310-200 version,
with maximum weight of 138.6 tons.

But wind tunnel tests of buffeting limits permit anticipation that it will
be possible some day to develop an A 310-300 weighing up to 1% tons. Such
an aircraft (see AIR ET cosuos no 8844) should have a range of 3,500 nautical
miles, or nearly 6,50C km.

A 510: First Lightening Program
As it is with all new aircraft, the builders of the A _310 are striving, by

means of a /lightening program/, for further reductions in empty weight
yielding an equivalent gain in useful load.

Initial weight tests have already shown the airframe to be somewhat lighter
(by 91 kg) than anticipated. The lightening program now adopted leads to
/a useful load gain of 68? kg/. Other weight-saving measures can be consi-
dered, in part through greater use of carbon fibers. But that program is
being held in reserve, to be started only if the clientele asks for it.
Weight saving thus obtained would total some 880 kg, but the cost would be
on the order of 85°C per kg saved.

(in reverse order) from 344 to 253 seats. Ranges are included batween 3.100 and
1.2.650 kilometers. depending on the type of aircraft and method of use. Enough

to meet, practically, most of the future requirements of companies for heavy trans-
port aircraft. except for the large slot filled by the 3-777.

In fact. so far..Airbus Industrie has aimed only at the single slot of heavy and
medium transport aircraft with the A-300. then the A-310 and the future A-300-600.
This is a profitable slot, however. insofar as the low cost of fuel had masked.
for a long time, the mediocre adaptation of American heavy transport aircraft to
median and, especially. short runs. You do not transport with inunity tons of
metal (structure and engines) that have become useless as soon as long runs are
no longer involved.

Airbus Industrie. from now on firmly established in that slot. with Mo customer
cowanies scattered over five continents. with a line constantly undergoing modern-
ization (starting in 1984. the A-30034 and 04-600 will replace the present b30034 ,
and cl. aircraft). has planned to develop its activities along two lines: production
of a ISO-seat aircraft. the A-320. whose characteristics will be firmed up in the
coming months (see our last issue); development of a new series of heavy transport
aircraft, making maximum use of already existing components (A-3OO and A-310) or
under development: (A-300-600), but oriented in accordance with two plans: on

the one hand, offer of a larger capacity (TA-9) and. on the other hand. production
of long- and very-long-range aircraft: IA-ll and “IA-12.

In the coming weeks, we shall have occasion :to discuss the characteristics and
performances of these three aircraft again, summarized, however, in the compara-
tive table that we are publishing now [at and] and that shows the possibilities
of the future aircraft. Because it is realized that there is no question of the
European consortium's wanting to launch everything at the same time. it is obvious
that a priority will be set up that will depend first of all on the market, that

is to say on the real marketing possibilities. In practice. the TA-9 has the best
chances of showing up in first place in the race in the second half of the decade.
The objective aimed at (capacity increased by 25 percent) will enable the TA-'9

to present itself as the successor of the nc-lo and of the L-lOll on all runs

not exceeding 6,000-6.500 kilonsters. provided. of course. that the twin-engine
formula is acceptable. This is already a very wide slot in itself. for which demand
will show up all the more rapidly now that Lockheed has decided to stop producing

the ‘l‘riStar and Douglas is forced to consider abandonment of the DC-lO line in
the future.

This observation also applies. however. to the long-range TA—ll (four jets) and
the TA—lz (twin-jet) aircraft. Between 150 and 200 seats. there will be the
DC-8-70 (Dc-8-60 reengined with Clix-56 engines). Starting at 350 seats. there

is the 3-767. In between. there will no longer be anything. Therefore. the slot
really exists that the TA-ll and TA-lZ can fill all the more effectively. because
these two aircraft will have the maxim in cot-non. on the one hand. with the
A-300-600 and the A-310, on the other hand. with regard to fuselage. cockpit. sys-
tems and tail unit. 0n the other hand. the wing will be new. if only because of
the need for increasing its area and for asking best use of the progress achieved
in aerodynamics. But the research depart-ants are now working on an airfoil whose
basic comments will be the same for the TA-9. for the TA-ll and for the TA-lz,
but capable of taking either two engines with a 28-ton thrust (TA-9 and TA-lZ).

or four engines with a 15.5-ton thrust (TA-ll).

The diagram that we reproduce here [at and] shows the mechanism by which the fuse-
lages of these three aircraft types will use both components already existing (or
under developmnt) and a new component: the center section designed to take the

new airfoil. Because the dianeter retains obviously the same. the only new tooling
required will be for this new center section. In view of the increase in takeoff
masses (+11 percent and +37 percent). the landing gear will also be redesigned.

but its basic components will be similar for the three aircraft under consideration.

To our knowledge. this the first time that atransport aircraft builder is proposing
to devote himself to this kind of Heccano set. not a posteriori. but, rather. a
priori. by studying in that spirit all the structural conponents. This will result
in a considerable saving of means. which will make the operation particularly pro-
fitable from the industrial point of view. of course. Boeing lays claim to similar
ideas with regard to the development of the B-767 series. but. up to now. it has
envisaged only a three-jet derivative. the 3-777 (of which it is. moreover. no
longer a question. at least for the time being). On the other hand. Airbus Indus-
trie leads by several lengths in this kind of operation and it will. in any case.
be in a position. if its partners so desire. to propose a series of transport air-
craft as broad as it is colpetitive. Carriers. who are anxious to have several
suppliers. will appreciate this.

It is observed. then. that the development of Airbus Industrie no longer rests

on a work tool (the industrial capacities of its partners are still mobilized only
partially). but. rather on the consensus of those industrialists. on the aptitude
to mobilize the indispensable financial collaboration and on the budgetary capa-
bilities of the goverr-ents concerned. The technico-industrial problem is becoming
political. because the desire to love ahead and to take the necessary risks is

the real driving force of development. At any rate, in Airbus Industrie Europe
has more than ever a remarkable chance to affirm itself on the huge world market
for air transport and finally to break the American quasi-monopoly.
