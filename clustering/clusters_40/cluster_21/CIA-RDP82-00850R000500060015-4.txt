‘the basic sguipnent used in telegraphy cospriees various types of telegraph
operation. the conteeporary models use the eodified international telegraph

code "fl-2 recon-ended for use by the International Telegraph and telephone
Consultative Oo-ittee. this code is a mifore. five-slant code in which
zero is tremitted by an absence of current and one is transmitted by the
presence of current. For this reason all electrical covenants are divided
accordingly into currentless and current coqonents.

Each coatinstion transmitted by telegraph channel in urn-2 code has a length
of Stu. where to is the length of a single signal. however, when telegrQh
equiplsent operates in the start-stop node. two additional service ments
are introduced. me first one. the start, being without current, is transnit-
ted before the code ooﬁination and also has a length of to. The second coe-
ponent, the stop, which coqletes tren-ission of the code cedination and has
the current position '1,‘ is longer-1.52.0 to. Thus. the total lcngth of one
code coﬁination transnitted by telegraph channels in lat-2 code is 7.5 ta.

In addition no the general characteristics described above, various other in-
dicators are used to define telegraph operations:

correcting capability, which characterizes the quality of work of the
telegraph apparatus and is deter-lined by the .gnitude of sexin- nrginal
distortion with which it is still possible to record an errorfree signal.
‘lhis cqaahility nay be theoretical. effective (that is. measured under real
operating conditions) and noninal (which is the lowest for a group of sinilar
devices):

theoretical probability. equal to the sad-u odor of words uhich can
be transnitted and received by the telegraph apparatus in an hour!

technical productivity, which takes into account the tins of transnitting
useful infornation and service infometiom

operating productivity, which reflects the design characteristics of the
equip-ant, operator qualifications and so on.

All telegraph equipnent is basically sieiler in design and has the following
primary functional parts:

the transnitter, which enters and converts the information to be trans-it-

ted. It conprises a keyboard. a coding device with five steel bars, each of
which nay occtpy one of two fined positions corresponding to I'1." and '0.“ by
which the coding device carries out the coding. the transnitting distributor,
those prieary purpose is to convert parallel code coininstions for-ed by the
bars into a sequence of electrical signals. are rotational frequency of the
distributors. which is a fixed value in all telegraphs. detersines the length
of a single siwal to;

the receiver. whose functions are to receive. convert and print the in-
fer-nation received tron canonications channels on papertape. he receiver
consists of a distributor which perforns the inverse conversions relative to

the transnission. the decoder with five decoding bars and a printer:

I;
MWUSEONLY
a drive nechani-g

auxiliary easeﬁlies and devices. including nechanians to feed the paper

and inking tapes, the register switch neehanise. a salt-locking device and so
'm.

Telegraph lines use the doeestioally produced 91535, 51-23, STA-21!. Ian-6,

STA-M67, mo? and other telegraph equip-eat plus the last Germ T-Sl and
T-83 units.

The STA-2H telegraph. which is a unification of the 91535, uses ins-2 code.

It has a speed of 50 bands ad a uni-:- operating range of 550 kilmters.

The letter 'A' in the STA-2|! telegraph pens 'autousted' because trannitter
and rsperdorator attack-ants are connected to it, uhich per-its it to be used
for transnitting s malted tape and tor receiving indomtion iron the chan-
nels on both papertspe and punch tape.

The availability of these attacI-ents leads to full use of comioations chan-
nels and the capability of preparing punched tapes in edvace lakes it possi-
ble to inrove the quality. Moreover. the me of punched tapes per-its auto-a-
tion of the nsssags relay operations at central telegraph stations and lakes it
possible to use punch tapes as infatuation carriers do: counters.

The STA-”67 telegraph differs only slightly fr:- the era-2:1.

The page-printing start-stop telegraphs vars a further development of tele-
graph technology. The 811-6 page-printing telegraph with transeitter nd re-
pertorator operates at a speed of 50 and 75 bands. has a roll of paper 215
nillineters wide and can receive three copies of test sinultaneously.

The Rim-7 pegs-printing telegraph, unlike the electronechanical devices con-
sidered above, is classified as an electromechanical telegraph in which cer-
tain nechanical assenblies such as the distributor. coder. decoder and a few
others are replaced by electronic devices. its m-‘I operates at speeds of
75 and 100 bauds and has three registers. autonated attadnents. a noise sw-
pression filter. a radio receiver and a outer of other auxiliary mite.

. Telegraph cot-unicetion can be organized using either general-purpose eo-uni-
cations included in the systen of 0581! Ministry of Comications and serving
various institutions and the ”lie through a network of con-unicetions depart-
nents or by some of user telegraphv. which serves those institutions that have
telegraph equip-ant connected to the user “1093893! station.

One of the varieties of user telegraph swig-ant is the international Telex
telegraph, designed for tranenitting nessages to other countries.

Facsinile oosnunications apparatus is used to tranenit fixed inages («loci-ants.
photographs, drawings, tables, textual naterisl and no on) through amica-
tions channels. According to the definitions of the International Telegraph
and Telephone Consultative Conittee, the tens 'phototelegraph" and 'phototel-
egraphic apparatus" should refer only to the amp-ant used to trans-it end

related to devices that transeit both half-tone and faceieile originals.

here is a fairly broad range of faceinile mications equip-ant including
the following devices:

llitting facsimile inges neasuring 220 X 150 nillileters (220 X 300 nillileters

devices can transmit one newspaper page in so and 2.3 sienna. respectively.

All facsinile devices consist of tramseitting and receiving parts. The trans-
ndtting part includes: a scanning device for breaking the ieage of the orig-
inal down into el-ents. a light-optical system by eeans of unich a light
hea- .‘.s nved across the surface of the original secured to the surface or a
revolving dn- (as a function of planar or cylindrical scanning). a photoelec.~
trio converter that converts the light reflector fro-- the original into elec-
tricial pulses uhose value depends on the ieage brightness. a video signal
converter, phue and synchronization devices no so on.

i'he basic devices of the receiving part of the facsiniie apparatus are the
video signal converter. the recording and seaming devices and the phase and
synchronization units. They convert electrical pulses fed from the mica-
ticns channel into a luainous flux which is than projected onto the surface of
photographic paper (this method is called the closed eerhod because the inage
becomes visible early after the photographic paper is properly processed) or on-
to electroche-ical, electrothernal and other types of paper (this eethod is
called open because the copy appears i-ediately upon receipt).

aent. including the TA-GO, ‘rh-65 and 11-72 (Soviet mien). m 621/65 and

Along the various means or cosmnication. the mat attention is devoted to
building and using data tranenission equipnont (APO) . Imis usually includes
an error protection device (092). designed to enter verification syiaols to
protect the data being transnitted against errors. a enory unit whose capac-
ity nust be sufficient to store at least one code oonbimtion. a control de-
vice which provide for interaction nong all assublies of the data transnise
sion equipsent, input-output devices and a sigal conversion unit (UPS).

The signal conversion unit is used because the data to be processed by counter
are written in binary torn and represented by square-wave pulses. No addition-
al operations are ordinarily required to trans-it than by telegraph channels.
But the data eust be appropriately converted to transnit than by telephone
channels, which is done by using a sc-called carrier frequency selected in the
niddle of the bandpass and the data are entered in it. his process. called
eodulation. greatly increases traneaission speed. modulation can be trequency
(the frequency of the carrier oscillation is sdaject to variation). amlitude
or phase.

Modulation is accoqlished in special devices called nodens which generate
the needed sine curve and nodi£y it according to data received. Deeodulation
of the carrier frequency is also carried out in due.

Sons of the data conversion units such as the ”chord-SO. the Almond-1200 and
the Minsk-1500 (rigure 11.4) operate in a senidqalex wde that provides data
transmission by telegraph channels at speeds of 50 and 100 bauds. Trensais-
sion reliability is 340'”. Intonation is entered tron papertape by an PP-
1500 photoresder (Czechoslovakia) and retrieved to papsrtape by a Pn-lso tape
punch that is connected to the ”chord-50 by a remote integration. perforation
and reading unit. Information is entered and also retrieved by pegs-printing
telegraph. Connections are nade using the call device included in the Alduord-
50 set. wolic coding and resolving feedback are used to ensure good-quality
transnission.

The whore-1200 data transmission equipment is used for working with tele-
phone mications channels and functions both in the suiduples (nitched
channels) and duplex (segregated channels) nodes at speeds of 600 and 1,200
bands. Hid: reliability of data tran-ission (no worse than 10") is achieved
by using cyclic codes with the polynomial x15 + x12 + r5 + 1 and resolving
feedback. The Ward-1200 operates in the following nodes: 'telephone,"
which is designed for service consunications, "data transmission," which only
trans-its data. "data reception,“ which only receives data and 'internal.’
which is used to check the working condition of the equpnent.

113s ”word-1200 set of equip-est includes a Pia-150 tape punch. an 28-1500
plntoreader, a calling and ringing device and an nicked-1200 PP transceiver.
If the user station does nothing but transait data, it will have an Akhord-
1200 PD transmitter operating in three nodes: telephone. data transmission
and internal. instead of the Aboard-1200 PP. the transsitter has a coding
device that for-s the check cabination of the cyclic code. a data input con-
trol unit that converts parallel code into series code, writes data into the
nesory unit and for-s the service characters of the data wit, a phase device
to deter-sine the beginning point of phasing and to establish phasing nudes
(the synchronous astlwd of transaission is used). pulse shaping control and
reverse channel signal devices and so on.

(n the other hand. if the user station only receives data, the set of equip-
unt inclﬁes only an Mord-12 Pu receiver which operates in the telephone,
data receiving and internal nodes. The receiver includes a decoding unit that
detects errors in the block of data received, a passing unit, an input register
designed to convert data fro- series to parallel code, a control pulse and re-
verse channel signal shaper and other equip-ant.

‘i‘he ”chord-1200 has a usury unit for sinultaneons storage of two data blocks
and a sodas-1200 that converts digital signals received fron tersinal equip-
sent to frequnq-naﬂulated signals suitable for transsission by telephone
channels and for inverse conversions.

The Husk-1500 autonatic data transnission equipnent also transsits by tele-
phone channels. but it has the capability of being directly connected to the

Minsk-22 coqmter. An inverse code is used in the equipment to protect against
errors: the reliability of transmission is 10-5.

The DVD-550 auto-atic data transmission equip-ant (Bast Ger-an) is also used to
trans-it data by telephone channels at speeds of 600 and 1.200 bands and en-
plays cyclic codes which provide a data transmission relidoility of 10".

The infor-ation read free the punched tape is fed to the assory unit, designed
to store data until it has been verified at the receiving station. and to the
coding unit where the data is converted fro. parallel to series code, and cy-
clic coding operations are performed.

The intonation is then fed tothenodenvhere it is converted so that itcan
be transmitted by telephone channels.

The connecting ccqonent unit carries the prinry load of establishing co-un-
ications between users. This unit is the lost inortant and has the greatest
specific weight at channel switching cutters. The principle function of the
connecting ooqonents is to ensure rapid, good cc—anicaticns between iwut
and output user lines. One of the nethode of connection is tile-sharing (spe-
tial switching, switching physically distinct circuits) where the coordinated
structure of the switching field is a eatrir toned of intersection points be-
tween input end output lines.

The too-l (Yes-BAN) data trensnission multiplexer provides connection of user
stations ovsr 32 (with possible inctoase to 6d) switched and segregated tele-

phone channels and unsvitched telegraph channels. as well as on physical lines.
The speed of tans-ission cen be so, 75, 100. 200, 600. 1,200 and 2.400 bands.

‘rhe “PD-1 has three types of adapters-the n-l works with the m1 and AP-‘IO
user stations through switched and unswitched telephone channels. the 12-:
works with telegraph equipment and the 11-3 operates with AP-Gl and N3

user stations over unswitched telephone co—mications channels. The «Po-1
includes a assory unit containing two Indules with 32 addressable cells each:
which contain the line control words. are nodule has a capacity of 2,112 hits
and is connected to 13-1 and 11-2 adapters and the other. having a capacity of
2,240 bits. is connected to the syn-3 adapter.

The RFD-2 (Yes-8402) progru-ahle data trans-lesion aultiplessr is designed to
organise large eystsss within the Unified Dosputar System It enchsngss data
between oowuters and all types of data transnission multiplexers and user
stations inclMed in the Yes renote data processing hardware.

The 00-2 permits connection of B to 176 cmications lines with spacing of
increasing the mint of co-unications channels equal to eight. mswitohed
md segregated telephone micstions channels and physical lines can be
used in this case. The transnissicn speeds are so, 100, 200. 600, 1.200,
2,400 and 4,800 bands.

Unlike the considered hardware data transnissicn aultiplensrs in which the
nonenclaturs of the user stations is always limited, the MED-2 pas-sits the
connection of different types of user stations. 'l'his advantage greatly in-
creases the flexibility of the systu. contributes to expansion when necessary
and increases the War of connected user stations.

Newussr staticnsarsconnectsdhyrswritingaprogruintotthPD-nory
without naking changes in its circuitry. ‘lbs app-2 includss a disk usury unit
with capacity of 4.096 72-digit words and a aicroprogrs-ing control unit.
Using these devices. the Inltiplensr perforce functions rslatsd to enscution
of specific exchange algorithms. Besides these devices. the "PD-2 contains an
internal storage device where control and intonation line words are stored
for all co-anications channels.

The Yes-8421 r-ote data transaissicn multiplexer concentrates 20 mswitchsd
telegraph mications channels operating at a speed of 50 bands and having
user stations at the ends into a single unswitchsd telephone line having a
speed of 1.200 bands. ‘l‘he me of this multiplexer permits the minor of con-
nunications channels to be considerably reduced and a significant increase of
their utilisation efficiency. One of the possible configtn'ations of a renote
data processing syste- using the renote data transsission nultiplensr is shown
in Figure 12.5.

since the functions of the renote data processing systsn related to analysis
of headings, establishment of guusa, message editing and interrogation of
user station status are perfcrsed by a ccquter. further development of the
Yes remote data processing systesn assues the develop-ant and introduction of
special commieations processors and the related redistribution of rants
data processing functions.

864 bits end the cycle ties is 160 nanoseconds.

The local eseory of the res-1030 is an internal storage device with rando- access
of. addresses on thin cylindrical nonetic film. he cayeoity of the local usury
is equal to 64 36-diqit words and cycle tine is 0.6 Iicroseconde.

The local aenory of the Yes-1020 is structurally contained in the nail: internal
storage (GOP). Regardless of the capacity of the internal storage, that of the
local aaaory cowrises 256 bytes. ‘me cycle tile is the one as that in the coo.
i.e.. 2 Iicroseconds.

m min internal storage (00?) is located on the second level. It is designed on
the basis of ferrite cores with rectmguler hysteresis loop by the 2.50 cyst- and
has capacity of 644,024 bytes with cycle of l.25-2.0 nicroeeconds. Simultaneous
access to two internal storage units is possible in older mdels. i.e.. so-called
double stratification of the usury, which ensues higher speed.

1he read-only aenory used in the Unified Ooaputer system to store control intona-
tion and aicroprogra- ie also located at the second level.

The third-level storage device includes a multiple: ee-ory in which intonation

that controls the operation of the multiplex channel is stored. It is an indepen-
dent storage device in older nodels of the Unified W Systes. The awry of

mmmmv
the sultiplsx channel is designed in the Yes-1030 on the basis of thin nagnotic
files. as is the local usury, and has a capacity of 1.024 32-bit infatuation
words with linin- cycle tins of l nicroseoond.

The mltiplex usury in the Yes-1050 is based on ferrite cores with wiring organ-
ized by the 20 system. The awry capacity is equal to 8 lbytes.

The mltiplex nesory in the res-1020 is structurally contained in the rain internal
storage. The capacity of the nultiplex usury depends on the capacity of the 001’.

The fourth-level storage device consists of aagnetic drun, Isgnotic disk. negnetic
tape and magnetic card stores. The nsin ooqlex in the Yes-1020 includes only nag-
netic disk and ngnoti tape external storage devices. All types of external stor
age are provided in the basic coaplex in older sodels.

Composition and designation of internal storage of Yes-1020 model. The internal

storage of the Yes-1020 nodal consists of three independent logic types of senory:
internal storage (GOP). local usury (LP) and multiple: neeory (MP). All types of
nesory are structurally arranged in a cannon salary wit. Access is possible only

to one of the indicated types of senor-y at each nonsnt of tine. Register (an) is
used as tho infornation register of all typos of nonosy and register (m) is used

as the address register. M bytes of inforution are written or road in parallel
code sisultaneously won access to the nesory.

The aain internal storage with capacity of 32 K two-byte words is located in the
sane Ingnetic unit. However. the capacity can be increased by including additional
magnetic units in the coQuter. Depending on the mdification of the internal

storage, the capacity of different types of the scary corresponds to the data
presented in Table 6.4.

The total access cycle consists of two independent cycles: read and write cycle.
The minimal cycle tine of access to the internal storage, determined by the tine
between two sequential road instructions, oosprises 2 nicroseoonds. Information
is read in the read cycle by the address stored in the m register, the road in-
fornaticn is recorded in the m register and is regenerated in the nasty nit.

Information is erased in the write cycle by the address indicated in the m and
infer-nation is then recorded fro. the m register.

The total capacity of the internal storage is divided by the nuts: of digits into
18 ferrite fields (16 infatuation digits and 2 verification digits). The ferrite
field of each digit is represented in the for. of a rectangular natrix consisting

in each uni-atria of 32 cores with direct branch and 32 cores with reverse branch.

The address selection buses of each of sides A and B of the magnetic nit are con.
nected to the address decoders DahA-A and DShA-s having 256 outputs each.

The digit selection buss of each digit are connected to their own digit decoders
(on 32 outputs each). The shaping of write currents in the decoders is controlled

by the infornation being fed through the corresponding code vrite buses (m).
The address (GTA) and digit (are) current generators excite the address ad digit
decoders, respectively.

nected by the sans digit bus (cores £1 and r; of the first digit). Depending on
the direction of the animate, the senicurrents in the digit selection bus co-
incide either in 'l in the direction of the first digit current or in '3 in the
direction of the second digit current. Thus. the nus: of outputs of the address

decoder is reduced by half on each side (256 instead of 512 are used) by changing
the direction of the digit selection senicnrrents.

Besides the 256 address selection buses of the internal storage. there are four
additional address buses on each side of the asgnetic unit that permit the re-
quired capacity of the local (LP) and multiple: (HP) senory to be achieved. Each
address bus permits a capacity of 64 too-byte words. i.e., 128 bytes. Thu. the
two additimal buses (one each on each side) provide a capacity of 256 bytes of
local n-Iory while the mining six additional buses (three each on each side)
provide a capacity of 768 bytes of the sultiplax unory.

As noted above, the new address register contains la infatuation digits. ‘lhe local
ee-ory address is located in digits 0-7 and the eultiplex usury address is located
in digits 0-10.

The internal storage is constructed by the 2.50 type in older nodels of the Unified
Oosputer Systu, the sane as in the Yes-1020 nodsl. but differs in stanctural parts
and nain engineering and operating characteristics (see Table 6.1).

The capacity of a single internal storage unit is equal to 32x 36-digit vords in
the Yes-1030 nodal, i.e.. it cowrises 128 mm. The cycle tile is equal to
1.25 microseconds. The eain couple: of the internal storage contains two units
with total capacity of 256 bytes. The internal storage in the Yes-1050 nodal has
a capacity fro. 256 to 1,024 Kbytes arranged in units of 256 bytes each. the
unit oouprises an individual device having total cycle ties of 1.25 nicroseoonds.
A word 8 bytes long can be selected simultaneously frost a single nenory unit.

FOIOFFICIALIBEONLY
The stmcture of the high-speed a-ory depends to a considerable degree on the
adopted ssthod of iloraation retrieval. me high-speed wry is divided by this

feature into one with direct addressing. stack addressim and with associative
addressing.

The addresses of the high-speed usury are indicated in explicit fora in one with
direct addressing in progr- instructions. in angle of this structure of a
high-speed usury is that of the coma registers in ndsls of the mified Coqu-
ter Men. meal fourdigit addresses related to the high-speed s-ory are pro-
vided in the instructions of the Unified Gunter System ‘me instruction for-t
detersines beforehand which addresses are related to the min internal storage and
mid: to the high-speed aeeory and the progrsa contains conlete instructions on
which data and for which addresses they are antained in the high-speed usury.

Direct addressing of the high-speed wry will be considered in me detail below
on samples of specific aodels of the Unified Coquter antes.

The idea of stack structure of the high-speed a-ory is used in zero-address con-
puters in which there are no instructions in the generally accepted aeaning. Each
operand occtpies a quite specific position in the usury: therefore. there is no
need to indicate its address in the instruction. Intonation eschsnge between the
internal storage and high-speed nesory is controlled by special instructions that
contain the address of the internal storage cell and the feature mich indicates
the direction of data translission: internal storage-high-spesd usury, internal
storageoprocessor. processor‘internal storage and so on.

The progress of probless solved in zero-address coaputers consist of an ordered
sequence of operational and address syllables of idmtical digit capacity. the
type of syllable is determined by the feature digit. If an address syllable is
found in a progru. the amber is read fro. the nain internal storage by a given
address and it is referred to the stack. If an operation code syllable is found
in the progran. one or two More (depending on the type of operation) is selected
fron the stack, the operation is fulfilled and the result is recorded in the stack.

The syobols representing an ddress or operation code in a progr- cua follow each
other or can be arranged in arbitrary order.

The working principle of a high-speed stack senory is an ordinary storage device
connected to a reverse comter, fro. which the access addresses are fed to the
high-speed aenory.

The address of the first operand red frost the high-speed neeory is deter-med by
the initial status of the counter. usually taken as equal to zero.

Each tine the next meter is read from the stack. a one is attracted fro. the con-
tents of the counter. after which the required nuwer is read fro. the high-speed
masonry by the address indicated by the comter. This seem that a sequential word
file can be read froa a stack type high-speed nenory only fro. a group of cells
with sequentially decreasing tuners. the next new word in the high-speed usury
is written by the address indicated by the counter and in this case the contents
of the counter are increased by one.

the adapter primarily authorizes data transmission.

Hultinachino coeputer comlexos began to be developed both abroad and in the USSR
on the basis of first-generation conpoters.

The first anti-whine cooputer canals: that became boom (the Sage antiaircraft
defense syten. United States. 1955) was a syetu consisting of 15 computer centers
connected by mications lines, in each of which too coepotors ot the sane type
were used and one at then was a standay coopucor. The oain task of this cowlex
was to ensure high reliability of the coqauter systeo.

aomgeneoue type eultinachine mater copious have been developed in our coun-
try: the 11-222 (based on the Minsk-22 counter), the Mtraibaud on tho Minsk-
32 motor), the Mininax (based on the H000 motor) and the Sun (based on
the Elektxonika-loo counter): inhaogoneous mtinachine caaputer cooplones have
been developed on the basis of. the sass-6. Mir-2, hint (based on the 14-20 and
Minsk-22 coeputers) and other curators.

In weakly connected systems. the counters have co-on use of part of the input-

Interaction between the prawns being fulfilled in each individual achine is
iwosaible. Enchange is carried out only at the intonation level. the first
computer enters data into a cos-on storage, while the eecond nechine can have ac-
cess to this storage device at its own initiative or on a signal received from the
first conputer (Figure 9.4).

Thus. systaa with weak connection include such nultinchine comuter conplenee in
which the role of work distributor along ell the retaining counter-s engaged in

task processing is allocated to a single comuter. cowutera are usually connec-

does not control input-output devices but only provides co-Inication between chen-
nels and synchronizes their operation.

The 'chennol-channol' adaptor consists or two control units. each of which is con-
nected to an input-output interface, and services its own channel. rho control
unite are connected directly to each other by several signal linee and com
single-byte buffer register to which the intonation traneoitted tron one channel

The main task of organizing co-unicatione between nohines at any level. as is
known. includes the capability of using co-on intonation files and progrne by
connected processors of the systee. The net flexible and highest speed is con-
mication of processors through a canon internal storage field. In this case

the calculating capability of the eyetee and the utilisation efficiency of the in-
ternal storage are increased sharply. IIoreover. the calculating syet. can control
a unified operating systee.

Based on nodela of the Unified Motor aster, calculating oleenee of two na-
chinea are prinarily developed. A diagra- of a two-processor coquter syste- that
includes different types of ooeeunications is presented in figure 9.5. Specific-
ally. the VK-lOlo nultinachine coquter clees has been organised on the basis of
two Yes-1030 coeputers connected by direct control buses to the mute: cowles
status unit (am).

The VK-lOlO cosmxter coqlex can operate in five different ndes:

l. The coeputer coqlex is in working order and operates in the 'hot'
standby node. In this case one of the nachines is the nain one and the other is
a reserve. Both the nain and reserve nachinu receive infornation caning fro-
external devices and process it by the same algorithm but the inforeation is
sent to external devices only by the Iain couputer. If the Iain cowoter is un-
able to transmit the information for any reason, the reserve ooqauter takes on the
functions of the min one. leaving the Iain water as the reserve. She Yes-1030

4. Coquter Ooqlms with Hainline Processing

Increase of intonation processing speed is achieved in the types of organisation
of ooqleaee considered above by increasing the order of processors, i.e.. by
parallel fulfill-eat of (mentions. Organization of a ooquter systee with train-
line structure includes division of operations (instructions) into several steps
and in this case each step is perﬂor-ed by a separate set of equipmt.

after the tirst step of the operation has been cowleted tor the tirst pair of
nuhers. the unit that inlemnts this step say begin to fulfill the first step on
the second pair of nuIbers and during this tine the first pair of austere is fed
to the second nit. where the second step of the operation is isplenented. when
the first pair of meters is fed to the unit inlensnting the third step of the
operation. the second pair of nudaere is ted to the second unit while the first
unit begins to process the third pair of nubers and so on. no identical ties to
perfore all steps of the operation lust be selected with this organization: of the
comlex. This tire is assumed equal to the longest step.

The organization described above is suitable for a specific class of prohlens
characterized by repetition of. operations of the sale tine, for emu. arithmetic
operations on a sequence of operands. Specially developed software and specific
hardware are required to inleunt it that ensure parallel cowletion or different
eleeentary actions. we mainline sethod provides the greater effectiveness. the
sore couplicated the operations to he perforated are.

high readiness and reliability;
functional flexibility:
high efficiency and productivity.

The readiness of the coupler is usually understood as the degree of capability of
the couples to perforo its own functions at the meant when it is required for
data processing. Readiness tine consists of the idle tins and operating tins of
the copier. Therefore. this characteristic is closely related to the operating
reliability of the eagles.

Recent investigations (22] showed that the reliability of a Inltiprocessor com-
tar coqler is higher than that of a sultinachine cosputer coeples. This is relat-
ed to the capability of access of all processors to the entire many and the
capacity of the nultipmcossor comuter cleex to rapid reconfiguration.

The flexibility of the systen is not only the capability of the systen to rear
range its own configuration matiwly easily, but also to rearrange the func-
tional properties of the eysten that sums high readiness and reliability of tho
systen with nininu coqoaition. This quality of tho syste- per-its all systees
resources to be used by each user (task) and also provides access of several pro-
grams to large data bases.

Efficiency and productivity are deternined in multiprocessor syste-s the sane as
in single-processor coaputors. It should be noted that the utilization efficiency
of multiprocessor coqlenes is especially high when solving large problem if a
restriction is placed on the ties of solving thee. Solution of these problem nay
be iapossible in a single-processor coqauter.

The nain disadvantages of multiprocessor coqmter cowlenes should include the
following:

coaplexity of systee progreuing;

complexity of checking systen progress and large expenditures on organisation
of checking:

an increase of efficiency with an increase of the omer of functional mite
is hinderedby an increase in the cost of the comlex:

the capability of changing the configuration of the couples and of increasing
the utnods of commieation is linited by the apparatus pmttios of functional
units. namely the presence of tine-sharing of a cosmn bus. the umber of inputs
to the notary. specifications inpoaed by the interface and the presence of delays
in trans-lesion of signals deter-load by the length of the cables between units.

The Bl'brus-l multiprocessor comuter comlex having nodular structure has been
developed in our country. he following capabilities are provided in this nulti-
processor coaputer couples depending on its makeup: an increase of productivity

per second and that through the standard channel is 1.3 eillion bytes per second.

The Bl'hrus-l nultiprocessor coaputsr couple: is designed on the basis of inte-
grated circuits and is related by its comonant base to third-generation cowotera.
However. develop-eat of the principles warned in this eagles nude it possible
to work out and begin production of the Bl'brus-Z Iultiprocessor counter couple:
with productivity of none than 100 nillion operations per second. It is designed
on the basis of nicrocircuits with high degree of integration (large integrated
circuits) and is therefore related to fourth-generation conputers.

The software designed for the m'hrus-l nultiprocessor cowuter comics can be
fully utilized ﬁor the El'brus-Z cleex as well.

rigure 2.9. Intonation Coding on Eight-Track Papertape in Yes
Ooaputer

The disadvantages of papertape should include low strength and difficulty of cor-
recting errors and also no capability of preliminary grouping of intonation. How-
ever. because of the advantages noted previously. papertape is one of the most
widely used information carriers.

Magnetic tape is a plastic or polyester tape coated with ferromagnetic material.

Information is recorded on a magnetic tape and the recorded information is read by
means of a magnetic head when the tape moves over it (see Gupter B for more
details).

Magnetic tapes have different Width and different number of tracks. The width of
a standard tape is 12.7 3. Its length in the reel comprises 125-1,000 asters.

Information is recorded or read in groups of words arranged in specific zones hav-
ing their own nuber. The hunters of the zones. instructions and numbers are re-
corded on code tracks. Information is recorded and read by the magnetic head t
located along the code tracks. the recording and reading speed cerises 104-10
or more characters per second. Recording density is 8-64 bits/n.

The shape and arrange-ant of tracks on a magnetic tape 12.7 om wide are shown in
Figure 2.10. A total of nine tracks are located on the tape. of which eight are

information tracks and one (the fourth from the base edge) is a control track
which is used to check the correctness of information transmission by evenness.

Recording of binary symbols on the tracks is shown arbitrarily.

magnetic tapes have found broad application in aodern oosputers as large-capacity
external storage devices. ‘l'heir sphere of utilisation was expanded considerably
with the appearance of keyboard data recording devices. Magnetic tapes becane
carriers for direct entry of inforeetion into ccnuters. The high density and in-
{creation recording and reading speed are a considerable advantage of eagnetic
tapes over other eadnine carriers. meir nain disadvantage is the lack of capabil-
ity of visual reading of inforeaticn and insufficient strength.

Hagnetic cards. I. nagnetic card is a plastic card eanufactured fro. a polyester
base to which is applied a eagnetic layer coated on the top with a protective layer
of polyester file. me recording and reading speed is 20,000 characters per sec-
onds. Recording density coqarises lO binary characters per nillieeter. Inferna-
tion is recorded on several tracks. ‘the nmr of tracks depends on the dimen-
sions of the eagnetic card: a card eeaeuring 366 r 82.5 - has 56 tracks and one
aeasuring 76.2 x 25.4 .a has 21 tracks. The capacity of each of the cards coe-
priaes 130.000 and “500 binary dnaracters. respectively. For ooqarieon let u:
point out that the average capacity of a pmoh card is Qprosieately 5,000
characters.

The intonation characters considered above should provide rather rapid entry of
data into captors. siaple checking of the correctness of intonation entry and
the capability of checking the intonation during processing. including visual
checking. to arrange it in order and to replace it if necessary. Besides printout
on an aunt (alphun-eric printer). internediete and resultant intonation should
be recorded on one of the carrier's. ﬁle experience of developing inforution
files shows that orgmisation of the production process of carrier preparation and
their adaptability to making chmges and nodificetions amt be taken into account
when selecting an information carrier. along with its capacity.

Punch cards with zones for graphic nerks. The punch carriers (punch cards and
papertapes) considered earlier have a significant disedvantage--the laaor expen-
ditures to prepare them conprise 90 percent of the entire erpendituresfor nechine
processing of information. mic is related to the fact that information is trans-
ferred to these carriers by mus). setting of it on the keyboard of special data

Cards with graphic markers are used to automate the infonaticn process. 'i'his
card is a standard eo-oolm p\mch card on which zones for graphic markers are
designated typographically.

Punch cards are manufactured in two types: those with zones for marks on the front
side (PG 80/27)-cne-sided-and with zones on the front and back side (POGO/SQ)—
two-sided. The zones of each side of ﬁle pmch card are 27 oval coluns. each of
which occxpies three colms. mtry of infatuation on this card reduces to shading
the ovals with soft pencil or light-conducting pens. Inforsmtion is read from the
punch cards automatically by means of reading perforators. A total of 27 marks can
be read and 21 perforations can be pmched from a one-sided pinch card during one
pass of the card through the machine. while 54 marks can be read and 54 perfora-
tions can be made with a two-sided card. The reading speed is 100-120 punch cards
per minute. During reading the cards love by positions: therefore, the nuaber of
calms during reading and perforation does not effect the productivity of the
machine.

Machine-readable documents--these are docmnts for automatic readout of informa-
tion--are a combination primary document and machine carrier. These “cunts are
dual-cards and standardized forms for automatic reading machines.

A dual-card combines the functions of primary duct-ant and pinch card. 111a form of
the primary docuent is entered on it typographically. ‘l'he requisites. i.e.. the
information model. are indicated in the supernunerical field.

Permanent characters are punched by dmlicetion from previously prepared permanent
papertape. ‘l‘he volune of this information. as shown by experience. caprises 75-
80 percent of the total volume of data.

The variable characters md qualitative indicators are recorded in dual-cards by
means of graphic markers which are read automatically by means of reading
perforators.

The use of dual-cards permits almost col-plete automation of the perforation process.

Standardized forms are used for direct readout of information by using automatic
reading machines. ‘l'he information is recorded on forms in a code convenient for
perception by the machine. Information is recorded by means of graphic markers
with noraalired and stylized types.

Information is recorded in normalized types by hand in special rectangles iaprinted
on the form typographically. Several normalised types have been developed. They
may include a type for the nuts-701 automatic reading machine. which is entered in
the rectangles measuring 5 X 3.5 u. A total of lO nubers and 4 service charac-
ters can be entered on the form by using this type. They also include a type for
encoding postal addresses on envelopes.

Stylized types include type which comrises code eleamnts of each alphabet charac-
ter. An exanple of it is 945-? aagnetic stylized type which is entered on forms
by a typewriter keyboard and magnetic tape iupregnated with magnetic ink.

‘lhe nethod of transferring information onto Iagnetic carriers when filling out
duct-ants is now used extensively to autoeete carrier preparation processes. The
harchIare that inleunts the indicated nethod includes bookkeeping and billing na-
chines outfitted with special attach-ants. A papertwe. punch card or eagnetic
tape can be produced as the naduine carrier during their operation.

2.3. Devices for Data Preparation end Rewriting Intonation fro. the Carrier to
Another

Intonation is now entered into ndern ooeputere neinly from pmch cards. papertape
and magnetic tapes. Date preparation devices based on pmch cards. papertapes and
magnetic tapes are used to prepare these carriers.

Punch card data preparation devices (ms). hey are a perforetor designed to ap-
ply perforations onto punch cards according to an established code.

The cosposition of the UPDK is different for individual types of oosputers. thus,
for example, cards are prepared for the him-32 coeputer by mans of the upon-32

in 0051‘ 10859-64 code. The upon-32 includes a Maul-254 typewriter and POO-6
:forator.

The following devices are used in the Yes coquter to prepare cards: Yes-9010
(USSR). which is used to enter intonation on pmch cards with sinultaneous print-
ing on a roll or form. the Yes-9011 (USSR) designed to lake perforations on pmch
cards and to decipher the information of each colun on the @130! field of the

card. and the Yes-9012 (USSR) which coebines the functions of perforator and check-
ing-reading device.

The ”80-2/3" keyboard perforator and the 1080-2/314 verifier.

“me ”80-2/3!!! perforator is designed to enter digital intonation in rut-12 code

on 80-min punch cards. It is single-period. i.e.. the holes are pmched sinul-
taneously when the keys are pressed.

The following can be carried out on the perforatorz manual perforation of a set
of nusbera, letters and characters. passing a pmch card by one colm without
perforation (single skipping). passing a punch card by several colusns without
perforation (multiple skipping). cowlete skipping of a pmch card fron any colt-1
without perforation (ejection of punch cards). autonatic perforation of permanent
characters fro- a master card. automatic perforation of a series of identical

punch cards from a master card and perforation in one coitus: of any code Mina-

tion with up to eight perforations. The speed of annual perforation is 12 coin-Is
per second.

83
roe ornau. us: on“
CV. venture. m vnan

The perforator has two keyboardso-alphanueric lid nuaric. Mination keyboards
of the Russian and Latin alphabets, mﬁers and characters. are arranged a: the
panel of the alphanDeric keyboard. while 12 keys, of which lo are ouric (0-9)
and two are control holes (11 and 12) are arranged on the panel of the nueric key-
board. tech keyboard has three control keys.

The nuaric keyboard per-its perforation in two nodes: single- and two-period. In
the first case perforations are made and the card is loved to the nest colm by
pressing on the key once. In the second case perforations are punched and the card
is loved during two cycles—the set of inforeetion is collected during the first
cycle and perforation and covenant of the card are carried out during the second
cycle. The two-period node per-its inforeetion to be entered in a single colon in
any code.

The “80-2/2!!! perforetor consists of 12 preach solenoids and a aetrix with 12 dies.
when the key is pressed. the corresponding solenoid is triggered whose areature
lowers the die located in the die groove by loans of a lever. The die. when low-
ered. pmdzes holes in positions corresponding to the code being used.

The ”80-2/3! verifier is designed to verify the correctness of entering the infor-
nation on pinch cards. Perforation is verified by corparing the perforations in
punch cam with the data of pri-ry docunts.

The verification technique is si-ilar to perforation with the only different that
verification of holes rather than perforation of holes is carried out on the veri-
fier. In this regard the perforator has been replaced by a reading device which
consists of a contact block and reading \nit with 12 brushes. The re-ining de-
vices of the verifier are sinilar to the perforetor. If the under: of the pressed
key coincide with the perforations in a given comm. the punch card is loved to
the next colon and if they do not coincide it stops and a signal lam lights \p.

The res-9013 (08$) and Yes-9018 (cssa) devices are also used to verify the correct-
ness of perforation. The distinguishing feature of the Yes~90l8 verifier is the
use of a storage device. Data entered on the punch card are read and stored in
the nsaory. These data are entered from prinary doeunents by neans of a keyboard
and are compared to the data in the Isa-ory. An error signal is triggered if there
is disagreement. leading speed is 290 colums per second.

ation of punch cards for further processing of thee.:

The central control device. besides units used to receive and decode instructions
and also the synchronisation unit, includes units that provide mltiprograe opera-
tion of the coqzuter system interrupt end priority unit. ”or? security unit,

Aritheetic operations on mothers with fixed and floating point, logic operations
and operations on nachine words of variable length are carried out in the arith-

Several special processors are sham in the central processor in figure 5.1, which
is typical for third-generation counters in which it was planned to separate func-
tions of inﬁeuetion processing imide the central processor. for angle, units
for operations on binary nubere with fixed point. binary nubers with floating
point, for processing decimal liners and so on can be provided.

A high-speed store is included in the processor to increase its speed. me soon is
usually fulfilled on registers (high-speed register usury) having direct address-
ing. The register addresses indicated in the progr- b not require any processing
at all, which considerably reduces the access ties of operands free the 8020 cu-
pared to the access tine fro. the internal storage.

The $020 stores machine words of fired length subject to processing during mot
operations. intermediate results of calculations. values of indicss used for re-
addressing and also individual sections of program mich should be carried out in
the near future.

he internal storage control unit (3001’) provides interaction of the central pro-
cessor units and channels with the internal storage. All access to the internal
storage from the central processor and channels are provided according to
priorities.

It should be noted that a considerable fraction of funds and tins go to work to
develop the processor-an increase of its speed and imrovensnt of its engineering
and operational characteristics-during developeent of first- and second-genera-
tion cosputers.

A great deal of attention is now being devoted to problees of integrating external
devices with the central processor and internal storage and of organising the
functioning of the cmputer couple: as a whole.

The characteristic feature of third-generation coeputer develops-ant is developesnt
of computer system that include a nuaber of aodels differing from each other in
productivity. The productivity of the Yes coqauter fluctuates froe 20,000 to one
million operations per second, which is determined mainly by the principles of de-
signing the processors of these aodels.

Models of the Yes computers have very significant differences in the nakeup and
working principle of the arithmetic and logic units. As is km. the basis of the
am is the adder in which both arithastic and logic operations are realized. Like
other computer assenblies designed to fulfill instructions (operations), the adder
comprises the operational part of the All). The operational part of the am of the
Yes-1050 model includes two units-~the arittuetic adder unit (8A5) and the digital
decimal arithmetic unit (831‘s). The basis of the BAS is a parallel-operating 64-
digit binary adder in which the operands of all fixed formats (frol- a half~word to
a binary word) can be processed. The decimal nmers in the eight-digit deciaal
adder are processed in the BATs. An eight-digit logic switch is provided in the
BATs to perform logic operations on fields of variable length.

The operational part of the am of the Yes-1030 model includes a 32-digit adder
(SM) in which operations are performed on binary and decimal nubers and an

assembly for logic processing of inforaation (0033 in which logic operations on
the operands of fixed and variable length are perfonsd and the orders of oper-
ends with floating point are also processed.

Arithmetic and logic operations are performed in the Yes-1020 nodal in a cabins.
tion type universal aritlnetic-logic nit (ALB). The operations provided by the
instruction system of Yes computers are realised in the ALB by different switches
of the comination cirmit: therefore. the sans electonic assenblies comrising
the ALB can perfore arithnetic and logic operations and also operations with oper.
and addresses.

It is obvious free the brief survey of the arithmetic-logic devices of the Yes-
1050, res-1030 and res-1020 coaputers presented above that the use of units with
different functional designation in the an) is typical for the nose productive
Yes-1050 coqzuters, while the universal nature of the nose-bliss coqarising the
am is typical for low-productive counters.

The progran coqatibility of all models of Yes computers includes the capability
of perforning all arithmetic and logic operations, assesbly of shich is deter-ined
by the instruction systee of the Yes counters. but the characteristic features of
designing different aodels of central processors required a different approach to
realization of algorithu of the ease operations in different nodels.

The characteristic features of designing aritl-etic and logic devices and also of
realizing arithmtic and logic operations in the All! of different models of Yes
coaputers are considered in detail in 5.6. he nudaer of bytes simultaneously ac-
cessed froe the internal storage (access width) is different for coaputer mdels
of the unified systen. which is considerably reflected in the speed of the cc.-
puters. For ernple. the access width in the Yes-1020 cmputer is two bytes. it
is (our bytes in the Yes-1030 and eight bytes in the Yes-1050 coquter. Accord-
ingly. the instructions containing 4 or 6 bytes are accessed fraa the internal
storage in two or three accesses in the Yes-1020 couputer. while two instructions
containing 4! bytes each (ax, RS and SI formats) or four instructions containing 2
bytes each (RR format) are selected in one access to the internal storage in the
Yes-1050 conputer. An increase of the access width reduces the tine required to
perform an operation, but requires that the apparatus be sore conplicated. Thus,
for era-pie, 8- and 16-digit registers are mainly used in the Yes-1020 coaputer,
32-digit registers are used in the Yes-1030 caputer and 64-digit registers are
used in the Yes-1050 computer. which provides different nethods of reception. ar-
range-ant and handling of data in different models.

The mdels of conputers in the Unified System differ by control principle: the
nicroprogran control principle is used in the Yes-1020, Yes-1030 and Yes-1040 and
the circuit (with ”rigid" logic) is used in the Yes-1050 and Yes-1060 computers.
The principle of control with ”rigid“ logic provides higher speed but requires
nore cleex apparatus solutions, which results in naking the Indel more expensive.
The difference of the control principles is cmsidered in note detail in 5.3.

Models of the Yes coaputers have different capabilities for integration of indi-
vidual functional asseamlies during operating tine. The level of integration of

individual operations of older models of the system. having greater apparatus

col-position is higher than the younger models, which determines the speed of the
model. For eumle, the res-1020 and Yes-1030 mdels, having identical cosmonaut
base and sicroprogr- control devices, differ from each other in speed due to the
different level of integration of perfor-ing operations.

The two main devices of the central processor-the arithmetic-logic device and the
central control device-are considered in more detail below.

5.2. The Central Control Device

The central processor control device, or central control device (two). is one of
the basic devices of a coquter and is designed to automatically carry out the pro-
grams in the counter.

The central control device generates the min signals required to perform all oper-
ations provided by the instruction cysts. and also provides coordinated operation
of all assemblies and unite of the computer. 'the central control device controls
all operations which are performed in the cosputer m-ory. the arithmetic-logic de-
vice. in external device co-unication channels and in the external devices thu-
selves. Besides the central control device, the ccwuter system may have local
control devices that generate additional control signals.

As was mentioned above. cowuters utilise the program principle of control which
ensures automatic control of all the units of the machine. 'fne progra- includes a
sequence of instructions that determine the order of actions which should be per-
formed to solve a problem .

The program is entered in the internal storage of the computer prior to the begin-
ning of work. from which instruction after instruction is sequentially selected
during problem solving. Input data subject to processing by this program are an-
tered in the internal storage simultaneously with the progrn.

The order of following the instructions in the progrua can be given in explicit or
implicit form. he address of the next instruction is given with explicit assign-
ment of the order of tracking in the address part of the instruction. besides the
operand addresses. The order of following instructions is called forced.

Hcre widespread in counters is the implicit order of assigning instruction addres-
ses when the instructions are arranged in the internal storage one after the other
in an order deternined by the prom. algoritha. This method of instruction ad-
dressing is called natural. The location of program arrangement in the computer

is determined when it is loaded into the internal storage and the beginning of the
program is controlled by the basic address. Access to the program can be gained
(1.0- the oontrol console of the machine or automatically.

Bach instruction (operand) occupied the sane nemory cell in first- and second-
generation cusputers and therefore the routine instruction addresses were deter-
mined by adding a l to the least significant digit of the contents of the instruc-
tion address counter (the instruction address counter stores the address of the
current instruction over the entire time of fulfilling it).

93
FOIOFFICIALIBEONLY
The routine instruction address is determined in third-generation couputers by
adding the address of the current instruction and the nudeer of bytes that deter-
nine the length of the instruction to be fulfilled. ‘i‘he nus: of bytes contained
in the instruction is indicated in the nost significant bits of the operation code
and it is retransnitted to a special register of the control device at the meant
the instruction is fulfilled. 'Do find the address of the nest instruction. the
contents of the instruction length register are added to the contents of the in-
struction address counter.

If necessary the natural order of following instructions in the progr- can be dis-
rupted by using control instructions. These instructions include unconditional
control transfer instructions (unconditional transfer) . in the address part of
which is indicated the address of the instruction fulfilled i-ediately after a
given instruction. and also conditional control transfer instantiate (conditional
transfer) in which transfer addresses are selected according to the feature of the
condition detenined in previous calculations. Conditional transfer instructions
are used extensively when programming branched processes.

The progra- is control information that provides solution of the problan written in
machine codes. The conputer control device is designed to decode these codes and
to convert then to control signals. net us consider the designation of the basic
assesblies of the control device and their functional relationships during inple-
nentation of a single instruction (Figure 5.2).

The synchronization mit (38) coordinates the operation of all units of the pro-
csssor in tine. the tire during which a single instruction is fulfilled tron ss-
lection true the internal storage to finding the result is called the operating
cycle of the control device. which usually corresponds to the operating cycle of
the entire machine. The operating cycle of the control device consists of the tile
intervals during which individual aicrooperations are perforaed. This time inter-
val is called the aechine cycle. for crawls, an operand can he read fro- the in-
ternal storage. the contents of the register can be reeet or shifted by one digit
and so on during one aadaine cycle. The length of the aachine cycle is caltrolled
by the synchronizing pulse generator. The synchronising pulses are generated con-
tinuously by the generator and are fed to the cycle comter. the output code of
uhich is fed to the cycle decoder input. The Me: of decoder outputs corresponds
to the am of cycles cowrising the nachine operating cycle. The shaping cir-
cult of cycle signals should generate the entire sequence of cycles that ensure
realization of a single instruction within one operating cycle (rigors 5.0).

Several microoperations, tor which several functional pulses aust be generated.
can be porﬁomed during a single cycle in the processor. The nicrooperetions

96
mammal“
realized during a single cycle are frequently interrelated: therefore. these func-
tional pulses should also be separated in tins and should be generated in a spe-
cific sequence. this leads to the fact that a series of auxilisry pulses are
shaped in the synchronization unit. besides the basic series of synchronising
pulses generated by the generator.

Thus. for crawls, the synchronization unit in the res-1020 cosputer shapes five
series of synchronising pulses: initial synchronising pulses of series 8. nain
synchronising pulses of. series 61 and operating synohrmising pulses of series 1'1,
Rh! and 81. In this case each series consists of ﬂour pulses which are III-bored
tron the first to the courth (for enle. Gil. 6:2. 613 and 61:4).

cialired problans and also per-its one to give enulative properties to the control
system. 1.9.. it per-its a given coquter to fulfill progr-s coapiled for other

tions not provided for in the instruction syste- of a given cosputer is entered in
the read-only snow. the nicroprogru and network principles of control are con-
sidered in sore detail in 5.3.

The instruction control unit (an) prOVides for processing of the address part of
the instruction, generates the address of the next instruction and switches on the
instruction register, instruction address counter, instruction address register
and adder for foruing the access addresses to the internal storage. The registers.
counters and adders of the instruction control unit are progran-accessihle in Ed-
els of Yes coqmters. which aeans that their contents can be changed by the action
of control or operating progress. logether with the interrupt unit (39). the our
converts froa execution of one progr- to another during operation of the nachine
in the nultiprograa node. ,

The composition of the instruction control unit depends on the characteristics of
a specific coqauter and its designation (the address capacity of the ”chine. the
operand addressing systs- and so on).

One can use one-. two- and three-address instructions inthe counter. wich is re-
flected directly in the tins of fulfilling a single instruction and the sequence
of processing its address part.

Relative addressing of operands used in the cosputer is very convenient to the
progress-er, who does not require data on the internal storage reserves when con-
piling progr-s and who can begin recording the instructions fro- the sero address.
But the structure of the instruction cartrol units in which the for-sing assed>lies
of effective operand addresses (or access addresses to the internal storage) oust
be provided, is comlicated. Thus,

fulfilling a two-address instruction, which is used not extensively in nachines. .
The two-address instruction has the following structure:

The address of the first program instruction by which the instruction is generated
from the internal storage and is transferred through the code buses to the instruc-
tion register where it is stored during the entire cycle, is entered in the in-
structicn address register (RA!) prior to the beginniny of fulfilling the program
‘lhe instruction register consists of several functionally independent parts: an
operational code register (my). base meter registers (m) and relative address
registers (RA). The effective addresses are found in the address adder (sun).

controlled in the address part of the instruction in ixlicit forum-by the meter
of the index register. In these cases the effective address of the operand is
foraed in two cycles: the relative and basic addresses are added dining the first

Control signals are stored in the read-only awry in the for: of aicioinstruc-
tions. The nicroinstruction contains intonation about the sicroopsration per-
fornad during a single noun. cycle and also intonation about sorting the nest
sicroinstruction address.

Hicrooperation is an slensntary operation perfor-ed under the control of a single
functional signal (for en-ple. register reset to zero state. shift of register
contents by one digit and so on).

The group of nicroinstructions that realise a single aachine instruction or an in-
dividual procedure is called the slicroprogrsn. The nicroprogras controls the op-
eration of the machine during one cycle. A single instruction is fulfilled in the
Yes coqutsr in two cycles: the instruction selection cycle and the fulfill-ant
cycle. ‘lhs SELECTION sicroprogran col-on to all instructions controls the .chine
instruction selection cycle. 11;. fulfillment cycle is realised for each specific
instruction by its own nicroprogran. ‘rhere are two nathods of encoding control
signals in nicroprogra-ing. In the first nethod one binary digit with a constant
nuabsr is set into agreesent to each control signal in the nicroinstruction.

The single state of the sicroinstruction digit ms that the control signal mould
be generated while fulfilling a given uicroinstruction. The digit capacity ofthe
nicroinstruction slyould correspond in this case to the one: of niceooperations
perfornsd by the sachine.

A nicroinstruction can contain ones in several digits. which permits si-ultsnsous
fulfillsent of several nicrooperations. But in this case the nicroopsrations to
be perfoned should be oomatibls, i.e., they should not exclude each other. The
simlicity of shaping functional pulses and the capability of tine integration of
several nicrooperations are an mdoubtod advantage of the given nsthod of encoding
nicrooperations.

However, the mater of functional pulses in processors of Yes counters my reach
several hundreds, which requires a corresponding mater of positions to arrange
the nicroinstruction. We are than 10 nicrooperations can be coatinsd in a single
nicroinstruction: therefore, the nicroinstruction contains zeros in lost positions.
This disadvantage leads to inefficient utilisation of the storage capacity designed
to store niczoinstructions.

The second principle of encoding nicrooperations~vertioal sicroprogn-ing—hss
found greater distribution. the nicroinstruction is set into agreesent to each
nicrooperation with this nethod of control. A total of n binary digits of the

This asthod of encoding nicrooperations is analogous to tho nethod of encoding op-
erations with the only difference that a sore elementary operation is perforeed
here. i.e., a nicrooperation.

Besides the nicrooperations field, the nicroinstruction contains other fields, ape-
cifically the address assignment field of the next uicroinstruction since the coe-
pulsory eethod of nicroinstruction selection is used in tho uicroprograns. This
procedure of following nicroinstructions is dotereined with tho nicroprograe: method
of control to save read-only eanory cells: my nicroprograes contain identical
uicroinstructions (such as, for crawls, register reset, adder reset and so on):
therefore, it is feasible to enter these nicroinstructions only once into the read-
only memory and to organize access to then fro. different microprogre-s.

The generalized structure of a eicroinetruction for vertical nicroprogra-ing is
presented in figure 5.9. The eicroinstruction consists of two parts: the micro-
operations code and tho address part. The nicrooperations code includes data on
the nicrooperation which should he performed and also data on tho operand addresses
on which this eicrooperation will be perfor-d. Constants for foraing tho address
of the next eicroinstruction are indicated in the address part of tho nicroinstruc-
tion. The features which appear as a result of patterning the current eicroopera-
tion are taken into accomt when forming the address.

The structure of a typical nicroprogran control device is presented in Figure 5.8.

The eicroinstructions are stored in the read-only neaory, fro- which they are se-
lected by addresses toned in the nicroinstruction address toning assosbly (um).
The initial address of the nicroprograe is controlled by the operations code which
is fed to the arm. The addresses of the next nicroinstructions are for-sod from
the address constants selected fro- the address part of the current nicr-oinstruc-
tion and the features of the result of the current nicroinstruction. The address
formed in the arm is fed to the eicroinstruction address register (W). The
nicroinstruction read from the read-only nenory is entered in the nicroinstruction
register (am). from which the nicrooperations code is transeitted to the uicro-
operations decoder (DshHO), while the address constants are transmitted to the
UFM. The functional control signals are fed froe the output of the ostun either
to the processor units or to other devices, as a result of which the current nic-
roinstruction should be realized.

The network Principle of Control

ihe stain assemblies of the operations control unit in machines that utilize the
network principle of control are the operations decoder, functional signal genera-
tion assesbly and functional signal shaper asseably (Figure 5.10).

The operations decoder converts the sachine operations code to a single operations
index pulse. has decoder should have a miner of outputs equal to the outer of
operations provided by the instruction systes of the given machine. The operations
code is fed to the decoder input froe the instruction register, to which it is
transmitted as part of the instruction from the internal storage at the beginning
of the cycle of fulfilling it.

The functional signal generation assenbly is a combination of logic circuits that
provide shaping of the functional pulses required to realize all the instructions
provided for a given cosputer. Any operation should be fulfilled with a coqlete
set of functional pulses required to fulfill it. As an examle let us consider
performnce of the si-plest arithntic operation in a two-address machine. The
instruction fulfillment cycle consists of the following seven tine steps for
nicrooperations: .

l--Aw adder reset:
2--receiving the effective address of the first operand;

3--transnitting the first operand from the internal storage to the aritlnetic-
logic device:

4--receiving the effective address of the second operand;
5--transnitti.ng the second operand from the 0? to the ALU;
6--performing operations on the operands in the ALI):

7--transnitting the result from the am to the OP.

A control pulse is required to perform each of the enumerated nicrooperations.

for which its own logic circuit is provided in the functional signal shaping as-
senbly. The operations index and tine pulse should be fed to the inputs of this
circuit. The title pulses fed to the inputs of the logic circuits provide the tine
relations of following the functional pulses (Figure 5.11). The indices of dif-
ferent operations can be fed to the sane input of any logic circuit if these op-
erations require the compulsory presence of a given functional signal for fulfill-
nent. Thus, for exanple, functional pulses that fon the effective addresses are
required to perform all arithnstic operations.

In some cases the sequence of control signals may depend on some additional fea-
tures. For exasple, the operand my be transmitted fros the sensory to the arith-
rustic-logic devices in direct or reciprocal code depending on its sign. In this
case an additional index signal is fed to the input of the logic circuit (figure
5.12).

5.4. the Multiprogren Operating node and Interrwt systen

Problems can be solved in the unified oomuter cysts. in single- or nultiprogren
nodes. In the single-progran ntde the cowuter solves only one problen and con-
verts to the next problen only after the previous one is finished. In this case
only one progra- to be fulfilled is located in the internal storage in each nonsnt
of time. -

In the nultiprogrsn Dd. the nschine can perform several tasks. In this case
several progress to be fulfilled sisultsneously, the senory resources between
which are distributed by the operating systen, are stored in the internal storage.

The advantage of nultiprogran oosputers. to which the ooqauters of the mified
system are related. is the capability of organising different operating nodes to
service user programs. for erasple. batch processing . tine-sharing, interrogation-
answer and so on.

In the nultiprograe node. the processor fulfills instructions of only one progre-
at each uonent of ties frost all the progress in the internal storage. Conversion
fron fulfilling one program to another occurs when it is more feasible to fulfill
a new progran than to continue the previous one. for examle. when fulfilling
sons progran. it became necessery to exchange data with external devices or to
convert froa an operating progran to a service. control or other program.

Conversion fron fulfilling a sogmnce of instructions of a single program to a
sequence of another progrsn is called interruption in the nultiprograsning node.

Organization of the interrrpt system The interrwt process is accomlished in the
mitied cowuter syste- hoth by hardware and softnvare. a given sequence of in-
struction processing say he disrwted by interruption of the calculating process.

All possible interruptions in the res coqmters can be divided into five grows:
due to nechine verification circuits (nadiine interrwtions):

by progra- errors (progran interruptions):
upon access to the W801! (Swanson call):

by signals tron external sauces (external interrwtions):

due to input-output devices (mm-output internptims).
Let us consider the nature and cause for each group of interactions.

1. Hadrine interruption: occur when breakdowns are detected dm'ing fulfill-mt of
the progran. 'l‘he causes of aadnine interrogations nay he errors in the evenness of
a aachine word or address upon access to the internal storage. malfunctions in the

operation of a channel or external device. malfunctions of the power amply systel
and so on.

Processing these interactions depenth on the error recording progress located in
the operating system There are several types of error recording progress. each
of which signals the state of the processor and channels to the operator with dif-
terent degree of detail. Depending on the naturu of the error or naltunction.
these program either convert the processor to the standby state or transfer con-
trol to the com-noun prograa to continue tulrilling the progran to be processed.

2. Program interruptions occur when musual situations arising during fulfill-ant
of. the program appear. The reasons for these situations say he errors in the op-
erations code. incorrect addressing. overflow of the digit satrix and so on.

A total of 15 different types of program interactions. to each of which corre-
sponds its own interrupt code. is provided for in all nodels of the Yes coquters.
The progran internptions are enuerated below:

1) incorrechtess of operations code (the operations code is not indicated or
the operation is not contained in the given nodal of the processor):

2) a privileged operation (incorrect utilisation of an operation. If it is
encountered in the mom state. then an internption occurs):

3) incorrection of mom-r instruction (it the mam: instruction is trans—
nitted to a ditterent instruction of the sans type):

a

4) violation of neeory security (the key of the nenory mit for the instruc-
tion or operand does not coincide with the protection key in the progra- status
word):

5) incorrect addressing (if the address indicates any part of data, instruction
or control word and goes beyond the liaite of the weary of a given aachine):

6) incorrect specification (data. instruction or control word address does not
correspond to the integer boundary of the given infer-tion wit: the register ad-
dress with floating point differing fron 0. 2, 4 or 6 is indicated: the length of
the nultiplier or divisor in deoiul arith-tic operations exceeds the pernissible

fields overlap incorrectly in decieal arithnetic operations or the nuﬂaer of most

significant zero nutter: is less in the nultiplicnd field than in the nultiplier
field):

8) overfilling with fixed point (conversion fron lost significant bits occurs
or the most signifith hits are lost in addition. swtraction md shift operations

or in operations on nunber signs. In this case the inforlation located outside
the register is lost)

9) incorrect division with fixed point (if the quotient during division by zero
is not placed in the result register or if the result of the WM 1'0 3mm
instruction exceeds 31 hits. In this case conversion is stopped but the infor-a-
tion located outside the register is lost: division is stopped)!

10) deciaal overflow (if the result is not placed in the designated field the
operation stops, but intonation that has emerged beyond the field is lost):

ll) incorrectness of decieal division (if the quotient exceeds the length of
the field indicated for it):

12) exponent overflow (if the result has a characteristic exceeding 127 during
addition, attraction. eultiplication or division with floating point: the opera-
tion stops in this case:

13) loss of exponent in operations with floating point (if the result has a
characteristic less than zero during addition. subtraction, eultiplication or di-
vision: a zero is recorded instead of the result; the operation is cogleted):

14) loss of significance (zeros were in all the digits in the eantissa during
addition and subtraction in operations with floating point):

15) incorrect division with floating point (if the divisor has zero nantissa).

Operations are stopped during interrwtions indicated in its-s l-G, 11 and 15. A

Interrupt processing. The factors that cause interruptions of each of the grows
enumerated above are processed by a separate program. which is part of the SUPER-
VISOR. i.e.. five interrwt groups correspond to five SUPERVISOR progress. All the

enunorated internptions inch the following sequence of operations: stopping of
the progran being fulfilled and transfer of control to the interrupting program
storage of the status of the interrupted program so as to return to continuation of

it after processing of the interrwtion. fulfilling the interrupting program and
transfer of control to the interrwted prograe and restoring the intonation of the
interrupted progran and restoring fulfillnent of it.

The interrwt procedure for all five groups of interactions includes storage of
the "current” 881’ in the cell designated for the ‘old" 88? and in selection of a
new 58? iron the corresponding cell which become the "current“ 88!. The 'new' 881’,
having Moose the 'current" 88?. controls fulfillnent of the interrupt progran

ruptions due to access to the smson have identical priority since they no-
tually exclude each other.

If requests for program and external interruptions and input-output interruptions
occur simultaneously. the Inchine responds to these interruptions in the following
manner. The ”current“ 559, i.e., the $8? for the interrupted openting program.

aw can be divided into unit and mltifunctional according to the nature of util-
icing the cowonents and assedalies.

In multifunctional aw, operations for all ﬁorsa of representation of ntalerical
inforaation are porforaed by the one circuits which are switched as a function of

the required operating node.

Inunitnw, itsownfmctionissttachedtooachunit: processingofbinary
umber-s with fined point. processing of binary nuders with floating point, proces-
sing of docilal motors and so on.

Multifunctional aw are used in low- and ”dim-productive aachines. The use of a
universal adder that perform all operations per-its the voluo of All! equip-sat
and its cost to be reduced. Unit typo aw are used in high-productive mutate.
Their use increases the speed of calculations since the different units can porforn
operations in parallel on information of various types. but the expenditures for
squipnsnt increase considerably in these no.

no can be divided into parallel and sequential operation types according to the
methods of organising the porforaance of operations on operands.

An m that performs an addition (subtraction) operation on all the digits of nu-
bers simltaneously is called a parallel am and has a parallel adder. A sequen-
tial am has a single-digit adder in which tho addition operation is carried out
digit by digit. Sequential m are used in low-productive oomuters in which the
isportant factor is the cost of the device.

Mine-productive cosputers anally have sequential-parallel type no and high-
productive cosputers have parallel typo am.

am are divided by the type of oceanications between basic assedslies into devices
with direct co-unications and with oainline structure. In no with direct co-an-
ications. the adder. control circuits of operations on operands and infornation
transmission control circuits are directly connected to the outputs of the corre-
sponding registers. In this case the operands participating in specific nicrooper~
ations are read tron specific registers and results are fornod in specific
registers.

In am with mainline structure, the circuits for conversion of intonation are
separated into a separate unit while the registers are used only to store opor'
ands during their processing. The input and output circuits of the registers
therefore contain only information reception and output circuits. nae intonation
conversion unit, which includes an adder, shifter and a umber of other cirwits.
is connected to the registers by two nainlinesv-iwut and output. 3 switch that
connects any of the registers to the aainline controls the output of intonation

is a 64-digit parallel operation binary adder of coutination type. Became of the
capability of switching parts of the adder. mwers of different fined forests
with fixed and floating point can be processed in it. logic operations are per-
formed by the registers of the arittuetic register unit (MR) and the necessary
shifts of operands are made in it by exchange trans-lesions between input registers
ml and m and buffer registers ml and R32. The result of the operation is
transferred fro- the result register (R12) to register m, which is at the sane
tine the output register of the am.

The decimal (digital) eritheetic unit (am-s) is used for byte by byte processing
of operands. There is an eight-digit decimal adder (ass) in the wait for opera-
tions on decioal nmers. An eiQIt-diglt logic switch (L!) is provided for logic
operations on fields of variable length. ‘lhe input registers of this unit Ml

The operational part of tho ALI) is represented in tho Yes-1030 Ddel by a single
mit joined to the register mit (Figure 5.17). Its basis is a miversal 32°digit
adder that perfores operations in binary and decimal o‘er systems. '

The ALI! adder is also used to calculate effective addresses. ‘Do do this. the ad-
dress part is transferred to the adder during the instruction selection cycle
while the foresd addresses are sent to the address register (RA). Besides the ad-
der, there is a byte logic processing assoably (our) in the wit designed for byte

All arithmetic and logic operations are realised in the ALB by a switched mina-
tion circuit as the aggregate of ole-enter? operations: logic operations, digit
adding operations. shift operations did so on. The nicroprogran control wait of
the central processor controls the ALB.

The ALB has two single-byte input registers RA and R3 to which the next bytes of
the operands to be processed are fed for the tins the next nicrooperation is car-
ried out. Registers of the register unit (BR) of the processor and the inform-
tion registers of the internal storage (0?) having two-byte structure are used in
the Yes-1020 to store the operands and interesdiate and final results.

he enumerated registers are connected to the ALB by input and output nsinlines

f) graphic input-output infatuation devices (intonation display devices-
displays and graph plotters.

External storage devices (V20) are designed for nemriring, storage and roedmt of
large volu-s of intention. Infornation is exchanged between external and in-
ternal storage devices during ooaputer operation. nternal storage devices store
information on a nveble mgnetic carrier. Magnetic tapes. drum. disks and cards
are used as these carriers.

Operatorooputer cos-mication devices are designed for direct exchange of infor
nation between an aid cosputer. mess devices can be installed in tho inediate
vicinity of the nachine or at user stations separated fro- the nohino by great
distances. In the latter cases the «vices are installed at user terninals (AP)
and are called terninal devices. Operator-coquter oo-mication devices include
console typewriters. portable consoles with grow control deﬂce designed to ser-
vice more separated a considerable distance fro. the udzine and also display de-
vices--displays and display panels.

Due to the presence of standardised mications channels (input-output channels).
a large nuber of peripheral devices can be connected simltanoonsly to the pro-
cessor in nodarn cosputors.

Input-output duannels provide the capability of working with a motor with vari-
able oosposition of the peripheral devices. which has advantages comared to tea-
chines having constant set of peripheral devices. for examlo, the capability of
the user selecting the type of devices available to hi- and replacement of obsoles-
cent devices with sore mdern devices.

It is known that intonation is exchanged between the internal storage and periph-
eral devices in the input-output organisation syn'cen of the Yes M by using selec-
tor (KS) and multiplex (101) channels. The channels differ fro- each othor by the
capability of simultaneous servicing of several peripheral devices.

Control of PU operation is standardized: there is a standard forest of instruc-
tions. control and infomtion words and inforostion forest for control of any por-
ipheral device. m: provides the capability of connecting peripheral devices of
different types to the channels.

There are control devices for specific PU (peripheral control devices-4N0) for
organizing ordnance with the peripheral devices.

Commieations are sccomlished between the input-output channels and the mm by
neans of a standardized co-mications systen, which is called a standard input-
output interface.

Input-output devices can be connected to the eultiplex or selector channel of any
nodal of counter in the Yes M by some of the indicated interface. Input-output
devices can operate in two nodesnsultiplex and nonopoleuwhen connected to a ml-
tipler channel.

The presently existing auto-tic reading nchines are capable of identifying a
linited set of written diaracters. Their operating principle consists of perfore-
ing the following basic operations: inspecting the inge of the written character:
ccepilaticn of its description and cowarison of the description to a standard.

In general for- the structure of the auto-atic reading nohine consists of the
sensing mit, assory unit. ccwarison bvice and resolving device. the sensing
unit displays the inage in the fore of electric signals. as a result of which a
code is for-d, i.a.. the iasge is described. The ccqarison device ms the
description of the iesge to standards stored in the usury unit. The resolving
device identifies the description with one of the standards according to the adop-
ted rule ad suits a coincidence or refusal signal at the output. he structure
of the auto-tic reading nschine depends on the adopted eethods of character recog-
nition. There are different nethcds of recognition. the met widespreadare the

separating the fragents of the character.

Depending on the type of types written on the standardized fore. all auoontic
reading nachines can be divided into two grmps: autontic nachines designed to
read sagnetic types and autonetic optical reading aachines.

Automtic reading sachinu designed to read (identify) nsgnetic types include those

the other is used for reject punch cards. 'ihe card perforator provides perforation
for all positions of the card with entry of m to 672 perforations on it. i.e..
with filling coefficient to to 0.7.

Monitoring the filling of punch cards. non-feed fron the stacker or double feed
and checking the evenness of infornstion in the buffer storage are provided in the
punch card. If an error is detected during perforation, the card is stacked in the
first stacker. Sending the punch cards to the first and second stackers with re-

of a sorting device. he punch cards nowe internittently under the perforetor with
a stop at each position for perforation.

The perforator has a ll-position operating cycle. One punch card is fed to the ne-
chine during each cycle with en interval of one position behind the previous one.

Let n consider the operating principle of the perforator by the functional diagra-
shown in Figure 8.9. Bach punch card covers the route in five cycles fro- the nor
nsnt it is grebbed by the feed knife to stacking in the stacker.

During the first cycle the first (botton) patch card is grabbed by the feed knife
and is fed to the first pair of transport rollers l by leans of which it is fed to
the second pair of rollers 11. During the second cycle the punch card is fed by
the second pair of rollers to the perforator, consisting of 80 sole and fuels dies.

During the first cycle the punch cerd passes beween the tennis and sale dies and
is fed by a third pair of rollers III to the bruh unit. The perforation process
is comletsd during this cycle. Current pulses are fed to the perforation electro-
magnets l with reading of infornstion fron the buffer storage. If the perforation

ing raised, the plate returns the pawl 7 together with the male die to the initial
position by means of stop 6 and the punch csrd is loved to the next position. Per-
foration is again nsde in the other position in the sequence described above.

During the fourth cycle the punch card passes through the brush unit and is fed by
the fourth pair of rollers IV to the sorter. During this cycle the perforations

are perceived by contact of the brushes with the contact roller through the per-
forations, i.e. . the perforations are read for checking their presence.

The fifth cycle is stacking. Depending on the response of the sorting electronag-
net, the punch card is fed to the first stacker or is sent by the fifth pair of
rollers V to the second stacker.

8. 3.6. Information Printing

Information printing is the lost widely used nethod of informticn retrieval. eon-
pared to the other nethods, it has the advantage that finished domts with input
data and the results of calculations printed on then are retrieved froa the machim.

Printers can be divided into two groups by operating principle-sequential printing
and parallel printing devices.

The intonation is printed in sequential printing devices by sequential recording
of characters. Electric typewriters. bookkeeping and billing machines and tele-
graph equipnent have because nost widely used among this group of devices.

Parallel printing devices are more widespread. The entire line is printed during

one operating cycle in these devices. which provides high recording productivity.
Therefore. they are called high-speed printers.

ihe nain characteristics are the nuiaer of different characters used and also the
nunber of characters per line and printing speed.

The nost widespread actuating elements of parallel printing devices are type bars
and type wheels. Recording of information using bars is wed in low-speed print-
ers, whose speed is 100-150 lines per minute.

he most widely used sothod of recording intonation in counters is recording by
scans of a type wheel using the dynanic principle of printing in which characters

are printed continuously at constant speed.

The principle of recording consists in the following. Printing wheels of the seas
type, assenbled on the sane axle in the form of a cylinder, rotate at constant
speed. There nay be from 129 to 160 print wheels along the length of the cylinder,
each of which represents a specific digit of the printer. A specific set of char-
acters (Figure 8.10), by scans of which the syebols are inprinted on paper, is en-
graved on the wheels. The set of characters for each of the printers is constant.
The characters are printed during rotation of the cylinder when the type character
1 passes the honors 2 of the striker nechanisu. A red ribbon 3 is located be-
tween the haulers and characters and paper 4 is located above it. The ha-er 2.

striking the paper through the red ribbon. presses it against the type character.
as a result of \duich the sywol is iQrinted on the paper.

he entire line is printed within several cycles. A specific mﬂnr of syiaols is
printed during each cycle slow the length of the line at different intervals.
thus. ell the necessary infornetion or the line is recorded after coqletion of the
last cycle. This infornetion is prelininarily stored in the ow storage device

After one line is printed. the paper is transported by one or several spaces de-
pending on the given node. The paper transport aschenisn is controlled by progru
by means of a control papsrtape. ‘l'he codvination of code perforations on this
papertape denotes the paper transport sods. After return of the paper. the device
is ready for printing the next line.

All h‘l‘sPU [alphamneric printers) of the res cowuters are cylinder (wheel) type
devices. The infatuation for printing is fed to a buffer storage fro. the channel.
Intonation is verified for evenness sinulteneouly with storage of it in the hut-
ter storage.

by nan and therefore has wide application in different areas or science and tech-
nology. hutcaation of the processing of this intonation using motors is of
important significance. One of the cans of autoeating the processing or graphical

(incantation is the use or graph plotters.
Graph plotters are papertapa graphic and text intonation output devices. They are

used to stake drawings of electric circuits and also of the results of calculations
in the (on of graphs and curves.

Graph plotters are roll or plotting board type graphic recording devices.

The basic sodels of test displays used in res comuters include the res-7061, the
Yes-7063 and the Yes-7906 cleex. The characteristics or text displays are pre-
sented in Table 8.3.

Let a consider the operating principle of text displays based on the Yes-7906
undel.

The Yes-7906 coupler is designed to enter, retrieve and process (edit) alphanueeric
information when operating in the Yes coaputers. The Yes-7906 canals: includes the
res-7566 group control device, \p to 16 Yes-7066 portable consoles and a unsal-
260.l typewriter. The portable consoles can be separated at a distance a: to 600
asters tron the control device. Portable screen consoles are designed to display
alphanumeric intonation on the screen of a cathode-ray tube and to can-pose and
edit it by team of a keyboard. A typewriter is connected to the Yes-7566 «vice
by a special lead.

Portable consoles are connected to the channel; of Yes coaputers by standard inter-
face lines. A portable console consists of two basic parts-a cathode-ray tvbe
display and keyboard.

The display has screen disensions or 320 x 180 m and a green glow color. The
displays can be distributed in a sari” of four directions. when fro. 2 to 10
portable consoles are connected in series in one direction. the last cmsole is
installed at a distance of not sore than 300 esters fro- the control device. If
one portable console is connected to the direction. the sexism distance at \hich
it is installed is 600 meters. The total capacity of the screens is 3,840 charac-
text. The pernissible capacity of the screen of each display is 960, 480 or 240
characters arranged in the following for-ate: 12 lines of. 80 characters each. 6
lines of 80 characters each or 12 lines or 40 characters and 6 lines of 40 charac-
ters each, respectively. The set of permissible systols is 96 characters.

The keyboard is equipped with two registers. 22 control keys and so alphanumeric
keys.

The wheel-260.1 typewriter is used only as a printing nechanisn to produce
printed copies. It has its own address and buffer storage and can be used both
for autonoeous data printing iron all displays of the couples and for independent
operation under channel control. Moreover, individual connection or typewriters
to displays is permitted to achieve automatons printing.

The Yes-7566 group control device has two buffer semry units designed to store
the information of portable consoles and the typewriter.

The buffer usury unit of the portable consoles has its own internal storage on
magnetic cores with capacity of 4,096 bytes.

The buffer nenory unit of the typewriter has a capacity of 1,024 bytes.

Graphic displays provide input-output of graphic and alphanumeric intonation on
an am. They are used widely in machine editing systems. in scientific research

8.5. External Storage Devices (V20)
8.5.1. General Data

ﬂuorization. storage and retrieval of a large volme of intonation is performed
in ooeputer eyeteae designed to process oomomic information. External storage
devices (Wk-information storee--aro used for this purpoee. As was aentionod
earlier. these devices include electromechanical van on eagnotic tapes (m). mag-
netic disks (m). magnetic drua (IIIB) and magnetic cards (all). The operating
principle of all thoee otoree ooneieta in the capability of ferromagnetic eater-
iale to be magnetized by a magnetic field and to retain residual ngnotiration for
an unlimited tile. 'l‘he storage India- in aegnetio atorago devices is a layer of
ferrolacqur or a galvanic coating.

The principle of recording information to a aagnetic carrier and reading it tron
the carrier is identical for all magnetic carriera.

The basis at the magnetic recording proceae ie interaction of a Dying magnetic
carrier and uagnetic hoade.

The magnetic head ie a special electromagnet 1 (Figure 8.11). consisting of two
half-rings and having an air gap 2 between the working surface of the carrier and
the electromagnot.

mirrent pulses of different polarity are transmitted to the winding of the mystic
head to record intonation. as a result of shich eagnetic sections are tor-d a:

the carrier whose polarity corresponds to the aware zero and one of the binary
ends.

The sane heads. by ssans of which the recording is ads, are usually teoyed to
read information fron the carrier surface. These heads are called universal.

men a carrier with magnetized sections passes under the head. a! pulses (luau)
having positive or negative signs. which correspond to ram did one codes. are ex-
cited in its winding.

Information is recorded on the ngnetic carrier in parallel on several tracks.
each of which has its own read/write head.

The main characteristics of VZU are storage capacity. speed and reliability.
storage capacity depends on the size of the carrier, the nubsr of tracks and
recording density and speed depends on the travel speed of the carrier. Il‘he char
acteristics of the carrier. the sire of the gap between the carrier and the head
and the method of recording affect the recording density.

All external storage devices are divided into those with sequential access to in-
formation and those with direct access. Sequential access devices include aagnetic
tape vzu and direct access devices include nagnetic disk, Isgnetic dri- and magnet-
ic card no.

8.5.2. Magnetic Tape V20
These devices are the nost widespread high-copedty storage devices.

A tape 12.7 an wide on which are located nine tracks. one of which (the fourth) is
the verifying track-dc (rigure 3.12), is used in rodent colputers (Yes no. In-
formation is recorded and read by a unit consisting of nine record-read heads. me
byte is recorded in one line on eight tracks in ROI-8 code. the intonation pre-
viously recorded on the tape is erased sinultaneously with a new recording.

The eathod of recording without return to zero (mm-1) and the phase-coded .thod
(PK) are used in the storage devices. The first nethod is used to record vith
density of 8 and 32 bits/m. in this case the nethod of recording ones is chang-
ing the state of the carrier magnetization and recording of zeros is the absence
of variation of aagnetisation. with the second nethod zeros and ones are recorded
with variation of the state of magnetization. This Insthod is used for recording
density of 63 bite/all.

During recording, grows of bytes fou a zone whose length is 184,048 bytes. with
recording density of 32 bits/n, a longitudinal verification line (PIG) and a cy-
clic verification line (Tats) are recorded at the and of each zone. A cyclic ver-
ification line is recorded on the tape after the last byte of data with interval
of 4 bytes. The longitudinal verification line is recorded after the cyclic ver-
ification line with interval of 4 bytes. with recording density of 8 and 63
bits/m. only the Pits is recorded at the end or the zone. 'lhe inter-none intervals

If there is incongruence. the control device emits an error signal. o/clic veri-
fication is carried out only on tapes having recording density of 32 bits/n. This
type of verification is not used with the phase-coded nthod. The lazin- nont

Storage devices are connected to the input-cum channels of the oowntor by none
of storage control devices. These devices have two operating modes-v-antono-ous and
channel-operating sods. Switching free one node to another is carried out fro. the
control console. The device is checked and adjusted in the autonooons ads by
mans of a control console and display camels.

8.5.3. Magnetic Disk External storage Devices (100)

Hagnetic disk extemal storage devices are related to those with direct access and
are storage devices in which the storage nadiul is a magnetic film. These vzu have
large capacity and relatively short access ties. The capacity of nagnetic disk
stores in mdern nodels of counters reaches hmdreds and thousands of nilliona of
hits, while the read/write speed readies Q to one million hits per second.

let us consider the general principles of HID design. A oagnetic disk is anally
manufactured of alumina with a ferromagnetic coating 250-650 a- in disaster and
2.0-2.5 thick. A forronagnotic coating is applied to both sides of tho disk. In-
fornation is rearded in concentric tracks of the disk. Each side of the disk is
divided into tones to reduce the track retrieval tine. Disks attached to the sane
axis are called a pack. A disk pack say be interchangeable or stationary (per-a-
nent). In this regard storage devices are divided into two growsnintordtangedale
magnetic disk stores (NSHD) and pennant nagnetic disk stores (M). A pack nay
contain a different motor of disksnfron four to several tens. A peck consists of
six disks with 10 working surfwes (the wper and lower disks have one each working
surface) in interchangeable disk stores of the Yes ooqauters.

The disk mit is divided into two units of 18 disks each in por-aanont oagnetic
disk stores (Yes-5051). The total nuber of working surfaces in these stores is
64.

Information is recorded on the track sequentially bit by bit in all magnetic disk
stores. The nmrs of the tracks are comtod fro- the edge of the ngnetic disk.
Part of the tracks in NED is allocated as reserve tracks for use in case flaws are
detected in the other tracks. Tracks with identical aware for- a cylinder. The
number of tracks in a cylinder is equal to the mﬂor of working surfaces of the
pack.

There is a mechanism for access to the read/write heads, which is a lever unit by
means of which the heads are set to any track of the working surface of the disks,

8.5.4. hagnetic Dr:- azternal Storage Devices new)

The magnetic drun is a hollow cylinder, 320-630 - in disaster and 400-100 - long.
nanufactured fron dinagnetic naterial with a thin layer of ferroeagnetic coating
\p to 40 eicrons thick. The layer applied to the surface of the dru- acte as a
magnetic carrier. Magnetic heads. which are arranged along the generatrix of the
drun (Figure 8.16). serve to record infornetion on the drun.

The drun is set into rotation by an electric actor at a constant speed. Upon ro-
tation of the dune. the nagnetic heads create a Iagnstic field which is used to
record infornation. The heads record on tracks arranged around the circunference
of the drue. The gap between the heads and the surface of the drun is 20-50
microns. Recording density is equal to 4-8 bite/I. Hovable heads auto-etically
shifted to the necessary track are used in high-capacity druee.

The capacity of the storage device is deter-ined by the dru- dinensicns. nuwer of
heads and information recording density. In mdern coeputers eagnetic dri- stor-

age devices have a capacity of mow-400.000 bite. The average access tine to any
section of the drum surface is the tine expended on a half revolution of the drue.

8.5.5. Magnetic Card External storage Devices

The Yes-5071 ngnetic card storage device is designed to write. store and read
large inforlation files (up to 109 hits). I: is used together with the Yes-5551
control device in Yes-1020, Yes-1030 and Yes-1050 nodels.

The Yes-SO71 storage device consists of an inter-ediete control device and storage
device. The inter-ediateoontrol device provides conuiation of the Iain Yes-5551
control device with the storage device. It is «signed to control inﬂor-etion
writing/reading on aegnetic cards, intonation encoding (decoding) and error
checking.

The storage device is used to store Iagnetic cards, to love the. to the read/write
heads and to trans-it the read inforution to the control device. It consists of
an autonatic card file mit (BAX). automatic card file control (BOAR), card feed
unit (am) and engineer's console. There is a magazine in the automatic card file
unit to store 512 groups of cards consisting of two sections. Up to 32 containers
are included in the sections. A grow of cards is moored fro. the selected con-
tainer and it is transmitted to the card feed mit by a special hoist. Cards are
selected seqmntially fros- a selected grow and information is also written and
read in the card feed wit.

The engineer's console is equipped with eanual control devices to died: the stor-
age device and also for annual replacement of card grows in the card file.

The Yes-5071 storage device has the following specifications: capacity of 125
uhytes, recording density of 32 bits/II, read/write speed of 52 mytas/s, average
information: access tins of 5.000 as. capacity of one eegnetic card of 2,048 bytes.
(16 + 4) tracks on a card. hopper capacity of 128 cards and nmer of hoppers in
storage device of 512.

CoIparative analysis of the main engineering and fmctional parameters of a aagnet—
ic tape and direct access storage devices shows that they have approximately iden-
tical capacity and intonation exchange speed during writing and reading. The
advantage of the direct access storage device is mdodatedly the short information
retrieval tine mad the cost of storing a trait of information on sagnetic disks.
drums and magnetic cards is approrilntely a: order higher than storing it on nag-
netic tapes. Therefore, these features of storage devices should be taken into
account when operating the. in cumuter system.

chapter 13. User Station System
13.1. General Data

User access to computers is gained in TD [Relate data processing] system Iainly
through user stations (AP). User stations are peripheral coqauter devices instal-
led outside the eachine room and connected to coseanications lines. If a user
station contains equipment for nanuel input of informtion, it is designated
mainly for inforeation gathering and if the user station contains a display with
keyboard it is used to work in the dialogm lode. Moreover. a user terninal can

Intonation: can be prepared and transmitted in a mar station in the onvline made

when data are ted directly tron devices. keyboards mid domts to the comica-
tions channel tor transmission to the coquter or in the ott-line mode when data
are initially recorded on nagnetio twee. punch cards and papertapee and then are
entered fro- these carriers. In this case the mar static: is equipped with the
corresponding input devices.

The output data ted tron the coquter to the user tenainal can also either directly
control specific production processes or be led to intermediate carriers (mar
stations are equipped with pmdn card and papertape output devices) and tor print-
out (user stations are equipped with typewriters and printers).

All the user station equipment is canscted to the control device. which is a con-

pulsory coaponsnt ot a user station and which pertorms the following basic
functions:

establishmt and breaking ot commications with the on [Data transmission
sultipleser]:

data conversion tron transnission code to the code to the external device
when receiving intorntion tron the coquter:

reverse anversions when transmitting information tron the user station to the
coaputer;

calculation and cowarison of check suns when transeitting intonation in
blocks:

natching input-output and intonation transmission speeb:

provision of autonomous and operating modes of auctioning ot the input-output
devices and so on.

Besides the control device, the mar station also contains terninal devices.
Unlike local terminals connected directly to the coaputer, the terminals installed
at user stations are called remote terminals. Alphanueric terminals (teletype

and typewriter). graph terminals (graph plotters, m with graph input) and so on
may be used in user stations.

transfer tunctions are accoaplishedby the UPS [signal shaping device] and nodes:
built into the user station.

From the viewpoint of users. user stations should meet the following basic
requirements:

the capability o! the user working in practically any high-level algorithmic
language:

simlicity of working with the system especially tor personnel who are not

natural language and tho egnipaent used should be simle to operate.

accessibility. i.e., the capability or rapid carnaction of the user to the
cysts. at any tin;

a developed checking system that ensures high reliability of data trans-isaion:
short answer waiting tins:
prevention of meanctionod access to mauthorisod peremnol.

User stations differ tron each other by the types of co-mications channels, tho
data transmission woes and eathods, theme or appliation and types or installed
terminal devices.

Thus. for sample. user stations nay provide intonation endings with the coqutor
in the dialogue mode when tho data are usually entered directly into tho coqmter
(roe a keyboard and in tho batch transdssion ”do. In this case the data are
first prepared. partially processed md are then transeittod to the counter. host
user stations can operate in these two nodes.

It the user station is not connoctod pereanarttly to the reacts data processing
systea and requires that carnection establish-ant procedures ﬂuid; are porter-ed
by auto-atic output and answering devices. than the capability of connection both
tron tho coaputor and Iron the user station is dotorainod by procedures of the
ompotition soda. than several user stations are connected to tho sane allocated
line. an additional change of control procedure is required to select the type

of user station which should transnit or receive data. 'ho do this, the subordina-
tion node is used. which is characterised by the determining role of the co-putor
in the conunications establish-ant procedure.

Depending on the mater of operators working simultaneously. user stations can be
individual and grow use type. Group user stations always have a large Ill-b0! of
input-output devices and also a storage device consisting of fractionally indepen-
dent units whose minor corresponds to the nmar of users.

The following are distinguished depending on the oguipnnt being used:

station is rather widespread since it is sino to service and does not place big
requirements either on speed or tho reliability of transmission. The route data
processing syst. of the unified ooaputer system offers several types of these
user stations: m2, ”-3, ”-70 and so on:

user stations in which teletypos, characterised by low cost and sisple opera-
tion, are installed. However. the transaission speed in than usually does not
exceed 200 baudsl

user stations in which there is equip-ant used to connect monitoring and sea-
suring devices. recording devices. preliminary informtion gathering and recording
devices. bookkeeping equipnnt and so «I. These mar stations (for annals. the
39-5 and A156 in the reacts data processing system or the unified cosputer system)
operate in real tire and have rather high speed.

Besides the considered user stations, programble user stations have been devel-
oped and used which can partially process intonation independently of a central
cosputer. These user stations contain a processor. internal storage and operating
systea.

User stations are used in the mat diverse areas. Thus, for exaple. user stations
that gather data and accomlish real-ties control are used extensively in different
ASU lAuto-ated control systes]. syste- have already been developed in mich data
is gathered froo sensors or seasuring devices by aeans of toreinals. ‘l'he gathered
data are fed over communications lines to networks for subsequent transoission and
processing. For real-tine control, mor stations include either a buffer storage
or a small couputer. sensors, real-tine clocks. eeasuring devices. analog-digital
converters and so on. The aggregate of those devices is used to observe and corb
rect high-speed processes and also to transmit and process the received
intonation.

Terminals are used for manufacturing and co-ervcial services mainly in user sta-
tions that gather data in nenufacturing operations or product output at production
enterprises and also for gathering data on the exchange of goods sold at depart-
tsont stores and self-service stores. These terminals have builtein data checking
or refining devices, auto-tic devices for reading encoded sarka or tags on goods
or produced products.

User stations operating in the dialogue lode have the highest speeds in rents data
processing system. For these purposes the user stations are equipped either with
electric typewriters or with alphanlneric or graphic displays. are aain disadvan-
tage of using these user stations is the absence of copies of the output results.

The coqzosition of a user station is determined as a function of the volt-es of in~
(creation. the type of user probleas solved, the inforaation exchange rate and
nany other factors.

13.2. User stations of the Reacts Data Processing ﬂats. of the unified Comter
slates:

User stations of the roots data processing systea of the unified comuter systen
contain a wide range of external devices that gather and transmit data. display it
on a display screen. enter tasks into the counter, mks inquiries and issue lists.
mnitor and nanage production and so on. Besides external devices. user stations
of the unified cosputer systen are distinguished fro- each other by the type of
cosmmications channels used. the type of connected data transmission mltiplesers
and sons other characteristics. nu basic data on user stations. related to the
remote data processing system of the mified coqmter system, are presented in
Table 13.1.

The characteristic feature of the AP-l user station (Yes-8501) is the presence of
paper-tape and edge-pornorated pund: card input-output devices, a typewriter, buffer
storage with cwity of 160 characters. control unit. telephone apparatus and so
on in it. All this eguipsnnt ensures seaidtpler data exchange over conutated and
segregated telephone and mutated telegraph mications channels at a trans-
niseion speed up to 1.200 hauds.

iihen operating in the autonoamu ads, the ”.1 types infer-nation on a typewriter
with sintulaneous preparation of papertapes and edge-perforated pmch cards. prints
out data entered earlier on the papertape and repertorates the tape.

The capability of connection to any data transmission sultipleser, the presence of
various external devices and the variety of functions psrforaed cmtribute to the
extensive use of the ”-1 in reaote data processing systeas for data gathering.
inquiry processing and so on.

The nP-2 user station (Yes-8502) also includes papertape and edge-perforated punch
card input-output devices. a Maul-260.1 typewriter (Yes-7172), a mall-200 and
so on. The Apt-2 has two aodels differing by exchange algorithms and the type of
data transaission sultipleaerss one nodal is connected to the EDD-3 and the sec-
ond is connected to the “PD-la and too—2. Both aodels operate at a speed of 200
hands. (he of the possible configurations of the remote data processing system
of the unified cosputer systu using the ”-2 is presented in figure 13.1.

All the enunrated user stations are designed to transmit data in the pack node.
The AP-d user station (Yes~8$0d) provides the dialogue mde. It can be equipped
with papertape and punch card input-output devices. alphanuaeric.printsrs. aeg-
nstic tape store and a typewriter. A single user station can contain no more
than eight of any external devices installed at a distuce \p to $00 nters fro-
