These things being laid in this solution and then ironed. The article thus treated is later on again put in water and a solution obtained which can be used for invisible writing. The best means for developing are iodite of potassium.Second: Sulphate of iron, developed preferably with ferro cyanite of potassium.
Third: Nitrate of silver developed preferably with 2 or 4.
Fourth: Rice starch, developed with ink mixed with water.
Fifth: Lemon juice, developed with Ferro cyanite of potassium.
