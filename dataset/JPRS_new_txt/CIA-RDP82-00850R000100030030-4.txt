TITLE: ”A Boat with Wings"

SOURCE: Beijing HANGKONC ZHISHI [AERONAUTICAL KNOWLEDGE] in
Chinese No 11 Nov 78 pp 7-9

ABSTRACT: A conventional boat is limited in speed because it
is sub'ect to large drag forces when traveling through water.
Genera 1y. there are three types of drag forces: frictional
drag. wave drag. and turbulent drag. To overcome these drag
forces. a new type of boat with wing surfaces (also called
hydrofoil) has been developed. The wing surfaces generate
sufficiently large lift force when traveling at high speeds so
the boat essentially travels above the water surface. In
order to ensure stable motion. a mechanism must be provided to
control the lift force. 0n the basis of the lift control

mechanism. hydrofois can be divided into three types: ladder
type hydrofoil. V shape hydrofoil. and rotating hydrofoil.

ABSTRACT: The brain and nervous system of a flight simulator is
an electronic computer which calculates the motion of an
aircraft in response to the pilot's control commands. The
calculated motions are converte~ into signals which are sent to
the simulator to change the attitude of the aircraft or to
simulate take-off or landing conditions. In conjunction with
the simulated motions. signals are also generated to simulate
the corresponding engine noise and aerodynamic noise and the
corresponding instrument readings on the instrument panel.

of searching. detecting and tracki enemy planes. and con-
trolling the launch of air-to-air m ssiles. Since its first
introduction in the 1950's. the fire control radar is now in
its third generation of development. The modern fire control
radar is a product of advanced electronic technologies which
include: modern digital signal process techniques which allow
the detection of targets under high interference environment.
highly stable phase lock loop techniques; and modern recursive
filtering techniques which allow the smoothing and prediction
of target coordinates in four dimensional space. In the design
of a modern fighter airplane. a unified approach is adopted which

the aviation community to d scourage or frighten birds away
from airports. to reinforce airplane structure to minimize
collision damage. to install microwave. optical. or laser
devices on board an airplane to disperse birds along the flight
path. and to utilize radar warning system to indicate the posi-
tion. density. and flight direction of birds.

SOURCE: Beijing HANGKONG ZHISRI [AERONAUTICAL KNOWLEDGE] in
Chinese No 11 Nov 78 pp 31-32

ABSTRACT: Modern airplanes are equipped with air-conditioning
systems to ensure that the air pressure and temperature are
maintained at a comfortable level. There are three types of
cooling systems commonly used on an airplane: air cooling
system. evaporation cooling system. and turbine type cooling
system. In a turbine type cooling system. the compressed air
is accelerated through a series of nozzles and its heat energy
is converted into mechanical energy by expanding through the
turbine. The main advantages of a turbine type cooling system
are as follows: high efficiency: high cooling speed: abundant

supply of cooling medium - air: versatility; and ease of
maintenance.

TITLE: “The JTJD Turbo-fan Engine“

SOURCE: Beijing HANGKONG ZHISHI [AERONAUTICAL KNOWLEDGE] in
Chinese Ne 11 Nov 78 pp 33-3“

ABSTRACT: The JT3D turbo-fan engine is a widely used power
plant on many passenger airplanes (e.g.. the Boeing 707. 72?
and the DC-io) because it satisfies most of the requirements of
a modern power plant. i.e.. high reliability. high thrust level
and low fuel consumption. Its structure has a iS-stage
compressor. an annular combustion chamber. and a h-stage
turbine. The first two stages of the low-pressure compressor
serve as a fan which considerably improves the efficiency of
engine operation. The higher thrust level and the lower fuel
consumption of the JT3D enable an airplane to reduce its take-
off and landing distance. increase its maximum range. and
increase its cruising speed. The disadvantages of the JT3D are
its relatively high noise level and pollution level. its heavy
weight and bulky size.

TITLE: ”Detection of System Leakages of An Airplane"

SOURCE! Beijing HANGKONG ZHISHI [AERONAUTICAL KNOWLEDGE) in
Chinese No 11 Nov 78 pp 39-h1

ABSTRACT: Airplane systems such as fuel system. hydraulic system.
air conditioning system.or oxygen system have many conduits and
fittings which are subject to leaks. Detection of system
leakages is an important procedure in airplane manufacturing
because they may cause severe damages to the airplane. Most
system leakages are the result of mprcper assembly procedure

or aging and fatigue of components during normal use a. A simple
method of detecting leakages is to fill the system w th
pressurized gas and search for leaks by visual inspection. In
recent years. more sophisticated leak detectors have been
developed such as heat conduction leak detector. odor sensitive

leak detectors. and chemical salt leak detectors. In this
article. the basic principles of these detectors are introduced.

ABSTRACT: Lifting body is a new type of flying vehicle which
has a very small aspect ratio and is equipped with vertical
plates at the wing tips to achieve high lift forces and to ensure
flight stability. The payload capacity of a lifting body is
approximately “.5 times as large as that of a conventional air-
plane with the same wing span. However. due to the high induced
dra suffered by a lifting body. its climb rate is slow and its
cru sing speed is limited «~95 miles per hour). Because of its
special flight characteristics. the lifting body may be developed
into a new type of vertical take-off and landing aircraft.

Chinese No 12 Dec 78 pp 27-29

ABSTRACT: With the rapid develo nt in space technology the
concept of a "city in the sky" fgzn-made heavenly palaces has
progressed from pure fantasy to the exploratory design stage.
Specifically. the following two designs are considered to have

a sufficient degree of maturity: 1) the revolving wheel-shaped
crystal palace which is expected to accomodate 10.000 inhabitants
and weigh over 100.000 tone: 2) the cylindrical twin-city which
rotates about its longitudinal axis and is expected to accomo-
date a maximum population of 20 million. In order to reduce the
coat of transporting construction materials into space. it has

been proposed to establish a mining facility on the moon and
utilize its rich aluminum. titanium. and silicon ores. Both
designs are not expected to be realized until late 20th century

or early Zist century.

ABSTRACT: The so-called " thermal barrier" refers to the effect
of aerodynamic heating on the surface of an aircraft due to
deceleration of air stream near the leading edge and due to
frictional effects in the boundary layer. Excessive aerodynamic
heating has many adverse effects: reduced structural strength.
fuel evaporation. discomfort to the flight crew. and distortions
or malfunctions in aircraft parts and instruments. To overcome
the thermal barrier. the following measures should be taken:

1) applying insulation between the surface skin and the

inter or; ) emplo ing cooling devices to reduce surface
temperature: 3) us ng heat-resistant metallic or ceramic
materials: h) flying at higher altitude: 5) reducing speed

when flying at low altitude; and 6) keeping the surface skin
