FOREHORD

This directory lists the JPRS non-serial publications, issued
in 1978. In contrast to the JPRS serial publications. the

JPRS non-serial publications are usually translations of mono-
graphs or reference aids in all fields and areas and are issued
under their own title.

A serial publication entitled TRANSLAIIONS 0N USSR SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY, with subtitles BIOMEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
and PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY was established in October
1976 to facilitate the handling of non-serial articles. Trans-
lations of books and large monographs will continue to be pub-
lished as non-serial reports.

Each entry of the directory shows the JPRS number, date of JPRS
publication, the translated title of the original text, and the
full source information as printed in the JPRS publication.
Copyrighted, 7000 reports are designated by "Ll" preceding a
four digit number.

The JPRS non-serial publications are announced in the semiconthly

NTIS Government Reports Announcements (ORA) under the appropriate
COSATI subject category.
