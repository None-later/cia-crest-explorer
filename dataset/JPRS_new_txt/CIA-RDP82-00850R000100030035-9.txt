U.S. UNVEILS NEH NIDEAST STRATEGY IN "ARE 0? IRAN EVENTS
Paris AFRIQUE-ASIE in French 19 Feb-6 Mar 79 pp 14-15 LD
(Report by Mousleh Ali: "Washington's New Plan"]

[Text] "Accept the Camp David agreements.... Concentrate on the need to
establish regional links between all the countries in the Middle East's
'free world'...and the United States is prepared to give you political
and military help in providing concrete protection for your respective
regimes...." That is the gist of the message which 0.8. Pentagon chief
Harold Brown has been told to convey during hie tour of the Middle East
which began 9 February.

In fact, this is a definite plan which the National Security Council. led
by Mr Brzezinski, drew up following events in Iran with a view to reassur-
ing u.s. allies in the Middle East. Because, for several weeks, messages,
warnings and statements from many capitals in the region have been con-
tinually pouring into the Hhite house, the State Department and the Penta-
gon: "Are you going to abandon us," the Western proteges ask, "to com-
munist subversion, to control by the Soviet Union and its allies? Why
don't you do something? Even Communist China is complaining about your
inability to meet the challenge of our common enemies who already dominate
Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq. Syria, Libya, South Yemen, Ethiopia and many
other countries which control the Indian Ocean and the entrance to the

Red Sea...."

From Riyadh to Rabat, from Amman to Tunis, from the Gulf capitals to
Khartoum. from Cairo to Tel Aviv the same cry of alarm can be heard, the

same demand for "firm and energetic action" to protect and save the pro-
Western regimes.

It was precisely a resume of those appeals prepared in memorandum form
that Mr Brzezinski submitted to President Jimmy Carter and his colleagues
in January along with a plan of action which, he says, will be implemented
according to the way in which the 0.8. partners reply to his suggestions.
According to information obtained from authoritative sources, the broad
outlines of the plan are as follows:

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

1. Reassure the U.S. allies, especially the Saudi and other friendly
governments disturbed by events in Iran. as to Washington's determination
to play a vigorous and dynamic role in the region in the future. That

role could even include a U.S. military intervention if the survival of
threatened regimes were at stake. It is vital that those allies in the
region understand that the U.S. "indecision" in Iran cannot be interpreted
as a sign of weakness. It should be seen in light of the regional situa-
tion and certain assurances which the white House obtained from the Iranian
military establishment.

2. For the first time the U.S. Government is now prepared to discuss the
possibility of establishing a "certain form of regional cooperation"
institutionalized among the pro-Hastarn countries in the region. The
form of that cooperation will, of course. depend on the very attitude of
the capitals concerned.

3. In exchange the Americans are asking their regional allies not to
remain passive and resigned. They must realize that regional defense
considerations transcend local tension and conflicts, such as the ques-
tion of relations with Israel. In other words. countries such as Saudi
Arabia and Jordan must stifle their disquiet and even their hostility
toward the Camp David agreements because much more than just the Egyptian-
Israeli peace treaty is at stake; the very survival of their own regimes
is at stake. "hat is more. a peace treaty with Israel would enable the
latter to add its efforts to the "joint enterprise against the Soviet
threat."

6. The Americans also want their interlocutors to understand that "the
perpetuation of the Arab-Israeli conflict plays into the hands" of the
Soviet Union which is trying "to infiltrate further into the region."
The threat brandished by certain Saudi leaders of recognizing the USSR
and establishing diplomatic relations with that country would only aggra-
vate the risks run by the pro-Western governments.

5. The Saudis should play a greater role in the region in order to
neutralize South Yemen and prevent any country "committed to the com-
munist path“ from achieving its aims. To that end Washington is pre-
pared to give Riyadh major strategic arms supplies to help Ssn's'-includ-
ing tanks and squadron of F-S's. In fact that is an indirect appeal to
Riyadh to encourage North Yemen to attack South Yemen.

The memorandum of Mr Brzezinski's plan specifies: "After all, the Saudis

have the money. the Egyptians the manpower (the army) and we (and Israel)
have the technology....“

ﬂow can that “situation" be translated into a mutual defense system? That

was the main object of Harold Brown's discussions during his tour of cer-
tain Arab capitals. Moreover, Washington points out that this is the first
time that a U.S. secretary of defense has visited Egypt, Saudi Arebis.
Jordan and Israel. There is a possibility that he will visit other Arab
capitals later. especially Rabat and Khartoum. (

MAURITANIA" MOVES POSINC FROM.” FOR MOROCCO
Paris AFRIQUE—irSIE in French 22 Jan-bPeb 79 p 16
[Article by Paie: Ouldns: "End to Ambiguitics?")

[Text] A few weeks ago the POLISARIO Front alluded to the possibility of
reconsidering the cease-fire which it had unilaterally declared shortly
after the overthrow of Moktsr Ould Daddah. This warning has created, among
Mauritania-22.. such a vivid fear that they were unanimous in approving the
new government's declared desire to move toward peace.

It is a peace which nevertheless has not gone beyond the stage or pro-
clamtions of intent and pious wishes, principally by reason of Moroccan
obstinaty in blocking all outlets leading to an equitable solution of
the conflict involving the Saharan people‘s right to self-determination.

"Made sovereignly and without previous consultation with any brother country
whatever." as the Mauritanian Minister of Information and Culture specified.
Nouakchott's decision to send an important delegation to Algiers to pay

a final tribute to the late President Bomedienne thus unquestionably
contributed to removing serious misunderstandings which hung over the

Gold Saletk government's policy. However. before carrying out this
dramatic gesture towards Algiers, with which. the Mauritanian Minister

of lnfornation declared. Nouakchott "intends to reestablish friendly

and fraternal relations." the nuerous areas of shadow which affected
Mauritanian policy allowed one to believe that the worst was likely

to happen at any time.

The most recent example was the launching of an inortsnt wave of re-
pression against the Saharans. in Dakhla in particular. And the parody
of the liberation of some fifty prisoners in front of the obliging
cameras of a French television channel did nothing to contribute to
blotting out its painful memory. Not to nention the last vote in the
United Nations when the Mauritanians, for once on the same side as
Israel. Indonesia and Morocco. voted against a resolution on Western
Sahara's right to self-determination.

There are so many initiatives which are contributing, in the meantime,

to giving a quite special appearance to the visit to Algiers by the
Mauritanian delegation, presided over by the minister of foreign affairs.
This visit. now at last, looks like s true about-face in conparison with
Morocco and its hegemonist designs.

In the speech delivered on New Year's, President Ould Saleck was, moreover.
as clear as he could be. Addressing the nation, he indeed made a point of
emphasizing that "Mauritania will take all measures necessary to finally
get out of the war [...] should a total agreement rennin infeasible."

That is to say-~or how else to interpret this last sentence7--even if
Morocco refuses to start on the road to a just peace.

"if there is blocking, reticence by one or the other protagonist,
Mauritania is determined to settle the Sahara question at its level,“
reaffirmed President Ould Ssleck, who is considering, however, the hold-
ing of a referendum in the part of the Sahara controlled by Mauritania
if a total solution to the conflict appears impossible.

For the moment. Rsbat's only reaction seems to have been the sending of
an emissary to Nouakchott in the person of Mr Boucetta, Moroccan Minister
of Foreign Affairs. The latter reportedly delivered to Ould Saleck a
message from Hassan ll containing threats.

This does not seem likely, nevertheless, to change the desire of Moktar
Ould Daddah's successor, although he has yet initiated direct and official
negotiations with the POLISARIO for the purpose of finally setting the
problem which separates them.

As paradoxical as this may seem, in the country there also exists a
strong and powerful Moroccan lobby, whose influence is by no means to be
disregarded. It has in particular the support of certain Arab monarchs
of the Gulf and the monarch of Saudi Arabia.

Riyadh has gone so far as to propose recently in Nouakchott the installa-
tion in Hestern Sahara of a costly electronic array, the "Hestmind"
system, capable of detecting any human and material presence.

Moreover, one must not rule out the existence of a possible connection
between the resignation of the chairman of the Mauritanian mining
company SNlM (which may be explained, it is true, by a simple dispute
of technocrats within the directing team) and the change of attitude
registered by the Ould Saleck government in the Saharan affair. The
ousted Mauritanian chairman, Mr Ismael Ould Anmar, is known for having
strong friendships in certain Arab oil-producing countries.

he that as it may, it must be expected that Hassan II is creating new
obstacles in the hope of blocking the path followed by President Ould
Saleck. The monarch already carried out, let us recall, an important

resettlement of Moroccan and Mauritanian populations in the territories
of the Hestern Sahara. in anticipation of a "consultation" of the Suharuns
uhich the United Nations could recommend.

It is likewise in this perspective that he recently named a Saharan.

Mr Khali “coma Ould Rachid. to the position of Secretary of State for

the Ministry of Saharan Affairs. Still in the hope of vitiating a possible
international settlement. Hansen 11 counts a greet deal on the support

of the OAU president in office, Gaefsr el-Nuneiry. as Hell as on the
support of countries like Egypt and Zaire.
