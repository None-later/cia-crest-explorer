DRUG-RELATED HOMICIDE SOLVED BY CID
Rangoon WORKING PEOPLE'S DAILY in English 18 Dec 78 pp 1, 6 BK

[Text] The CID (Criminal Investigation Department) recently solved a
case of homicide resulting from heroin overdose. causing disappearance
of evidence and theft by a group of men claiming to be the victim's
friends.

The body of a young man. later identified as Haung Aye Cho (19). was
found in a drain between Thazin and Gandama Halls at Thamaing College
campus. hlaing Township, at about 3 pm on 13 November 1978.

The victim's parents told police that the young man left home the pre-
vious day wearing a wrist watch and carrying a hand bag which were both
missing. Hlaing police opened a case under Section 302 of the Penal
Code for murder. The case was later handed over to the Criminal inves-
tigation Department.

The CID took up the case and eventually rounded up Munna, Tin win. Moe

Moe, Haung Toe, Kyaw Nyunt, Aung Kyaw Than and Htay Lwin for homicide.
causinsdisappearance of evidence, theft and taking narcotic drugs.

According to Munna and Tin "in. who confessed before Hlaing Township
Court on 23 November 1978, Tin "in, a stores clerk living in the family
lines of 973 CE (works). and Moe Hoe alias Noe Hyint of No 96, Rangoon-
Insein Road. went in a Mazda light-van to see Hunna at Tadaphyu Lake
Street at about 11 am on 12 November 1978. They met Munna and Haung Aye
Cho at a tea-shop at Tadaphyu Street. The four of them got into the ear
and went in search for one Htay Lwin, a person of no fixed abode. They
found Htay Lwin at 6 1/2 mile and bought K 50 worth of heroin from him.

The four then drove tn their friend "sung Toe's house in the AI film stu-
dio grounds. They found "nuns Toe at home together with Aung Kyaw Than.
Kyaw Nyunt and Mn Thet Thct alias Hi That.

“,0 "no allus Moe Mylnt put half of the heroin they bought from Htay
lain in a cigarette and started smoking. Munna dissolved the remain-
ing heroin in water and using a syringe injected Maung Aye Cho and Tin
Iin with the solution. Tin Hln then injected Hnnnn with the heroin xnlu-
:ion. Kyuw Nyunt. Moo “no. Aung Kynw Than. Mnunn Tor nnd Thet Thet were
present when they were injecting one another with heroin solution.

A few moments later Hnung Aye Cho started throwing up froth and lost
consciousness. He was fed salt water as an antidote. When that didn't
work Tin Win, Kyaw Nyunt and hoe Moe left in the Mazda to buy medicines
for use as antidote. About an hour later Kyaw Nyunt came back alone
with two Burmeton tablets and two 36 tablets. They ground the tablets
and Munna and Aung Kyaw Than fed Mnung Aye Cho the powder. Haung Aye
Cho. however. died some ten minutes later. Hunna took off the watch
from Haung Aye Cho's wrist while the latter was still in a coma.

About 20 minutes later Tin Win and Moe Hoe returned in an Opel van. Maung

Toe, Munnn, Tin Win, hung Kyau Than and Kyaw Nyunt agreed to get rid of
the body. Aune Kyaw Than and Kynw Nyunt out the body in the Opel van.

Tin win, Munna, Moe Noe, Aung Kyaw Than and Maung Toe got into the car and
drove to Thameing College campus. when they reached a spot between Tha—
zin and Gandama Halls they dumped the body in the drain between the two
halls. It was about 9 pm when the group dumped the body and dispersed.

Men of the CID. after questioning witnesses and suspects Henna, Tin Rio
and Kyaw Nyunt. rounded up the group. Police are still looking for Ha
Thet Thet aliashi Thet, the girl involved in the case.

The seven men, Munna. Tin Win, Moe Moe. Asung Toe, Kyaw Nyunt, Aung
Kyaw Than and htay Lwin. were sent up for trial before Hlaing Township
Court last Saturday on charges of homicide, causing disappearance of

evidence, theft and taking narcotic drugs.

[Editorial: "The Harihuana Shuffle"!

[Text] The headline rivets our attention: “Ottawa reviving plan to ease
marijuana penalties." And here we have Justice Minister Marc Lalonde
announcing that yes. he recognizes that "it may be a good time to re-
examine our laws in this respect," and he wonders “whether you can con-
tinue to have a law that is really rejected by such a large number of
your citizens." Sounds good. Sounds logical. Sounds hopelessly vague.

The minister must be familiar with the topic. It was Mr. Lalonde. in his
former incarnation as minister of national health and welfare, who pre-
pared a bill in 197k to reduce the penalties connected with.narijusna and
hashish. The bill would have saved cannabis offences from ﬁhe Narcotic
Central Act (maximum prison sentence for possession. seven years) to the
Food and Drug Act (laxinum fin: for possession. $1.000). It passed
through the Senate in 1975 and died in the House of Commons. Three years
later. Mr. Lalonde is considering another try, and ”sources close to the
minister" insist he is serious.

It would be nice to think so. Despite a Gallup report that 66 per cent of
Canadians endorse the decriainalisatioa of aarijuana, and despite estiaatea
that three million Canadians have used the drug. the Government persists

in maintaining that people who smoke marijuana are criminals. Last year.
33,281 Canadians were convicted of possession. Those who found the

interests and all the snares whose existence constitutes aggression against
the social body. with its degradation of ethics and sorality and its perver-
sion and disruption of cossunities."

lle stated. "0n the basis of these principles the Argentine nation has launch-
ed a frontal attack against the abuse of and illegal trafficking in drugs

in order to defend its social intep'ity and its spiritusl. cultural and
historical heritage. Argentina is working diligently to overoose and eradi-
cate this aggression."

Praga declared. "COMM. which. under sy chairsanship. serves as an advi-
sory body to the Executive. has produced reccuendations which have given
rise to specific social control seasures. For exasple. they have led to the
creation of cnumo. which is engaged in research. training and rehabilita-
tion. Also. special crisinal laws concerning drugs have been written; and
Judges have been espowered to seek the assistance of the arsed forces in
the destruction of ssrihuana. coca and opiu plantations. which are prohi-
bited under all circusetances thromout the country. Moreover. the use of

cocaine has been prohibited. along with the ispcrtation of the coca leaves

police then arrested Eduardo Higuel Dias. alias Eddy. 23. an Argentine citi-
zen. unsarried. a businessman. living at 1771 Fray Justo Santa Maria de Oro.

That is. Dias would receive word of the ship-eats. and the drug itself. by
scans of postcards sent fro. Amterdas by Cecilia Pucci. a trafficker living
in Holland. On nany of the cards the police found different dates by leans
of which the Argentine trafficksr learned not only when the goods would ar-
rive hut also how detection would be avoided.

However. this Eddy was not the only person arrested. The police also de-
tained Alfredo Jose Christ. 21. an Argentine citizen. unnarried. a clerk
residing at 29 Piran. Martinez. and Jorge Cayetano Blas Savignano. 26.

The authorities also errested drug users of both sexes. who. in order to ob-
tain funds. were inducing other susceptible young people. lergely adolescents.

LIST OF DRUG-LINKED PROHINEhr PEOPLE UNDISCLOSED
Sao Paulo POLHA 08 8A0 PAULO in Portuguese 20 Dec 78 p 15

[Text] The federal police have not yet revealed the list of politicians and
people from high society in Sao Paulo. Rio de Janeiro and Hato Grosso
connected with narcotics traffic and use found together with 17 kilos of
cocaine last Thursday when federal police of Sao Paulo arrested a gang of
drug traffickers.

The 17 kilos of cocaine worth 60 million cruzeiros was found in the possession
of a gang of 12 Brazilian. Portuguese and Bolivian traffickers. Part of

the drugs was to be snuggled to the United States. Spain. Bngland and Canada:
where another part was to be sold in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

Police chief Arthur Carboni Pilho. chief of the narcotics section of the
federal police in Sao Paulo, announced innediately after arresting the gang
of traffickers that he had found the list with the naess of politicians and
people fro. high society. Chief Arthur Carboni Pilho nade no further consent
about the list but an agent at the federal Police Depart-ant who preferred to
rennin anonymous aaid:

“Lists of naaes like that are very dangt:'is. The traffickers can put the
names of politicians and people fron high aciety in their address books
merely to conproeiae those people. But it is also possible that those
people are actually connected with drug traffic or use. Those lists. there-
fore. have to be investigated with great care. The federal police are
carrying out the investigations."

It is not known when the federal police of Sao Paulo are going to release

the list but it is certain that that will happen only when the investigations
have been concluded which. it was reported. will take at least another 10
days. Part of the depositions of the gang of traffickers arrested is also
being kept secret.

The 12 traffickers who made up the gang are: Haria Sanchez de Sueldo. Jose
Rojas Torrico. Helvy Gonzales ﬂax. Rogue Justiniano Calego. Antonio Augusto
Nunes. Artur de Jesus Cunha Rocha. Maria Dolores Abrantes. Carlos Manuel de
Oliveira Sanchy. Elias El Daher, Wilson Said Boutroa. Dinarte Vincente de

DRUG PROBLEM IN IRASILIA TZIHBD PUBLIC CALAHITY
Bresilie 0033810 BRAZILIZNSB in Portuguese 19 Dec 78 p 15

[Text] ”The number of drug eddicts in Brasilia constitutes s public calen-
ity." That is the opinion of Professor Geldino Horeirs Pilho, president of
Youth Challenge. an institution aimed at rehebiliteting addicts. According
to his infer-etion and that of Carlos Alberto Leandra. program director of
Chellenge. there are ebout 300,000 drug users here, with usage being more
excessive and sore glering in Thguetings end Ceilendia.

In Plano Piloto the habit is "canouflsged." Geldino explains. "because
eeny feeilies hide their children's problee since bresilia is en sdeinis-
tretive city. protecting ieportsnt figures who do not want to reveal the
existence of drugs in their hoses.”

They relate that 60 percent of the youths between 18 end 22 years of age who
are taken into custody are involved with drugs. end that the incidence of
drugs hes increased by 2.000 percent in the lest few years.

In an stteept to help those adolescents. Youth Chellenge offers thee "hope
through the word of God." The directors are convinced that the bible acts
on the minds of the addicts end chenges then. The boys end girls are in-
terned voluntarily. either by seeking it out spontaneously. acceding to
their perents' suggestions or leaving prison to be treated. Host of then
come fro. parents who are separated. alcoholics, or prostitutes. Many did
not have the opportunity to work and/or study and suffer finenciel diffi-
culties. Geldino points out that before entering the institution he heads,
some of the youths sought different ways to solve their problems including
philosophy, such as existentialisn. In Chellenge "spirituel power fills
their elptiness."

The honosexuel drug eddict is one of the concerns of the group that works

in that institution. The holoeexusl’s existence is to turn to drugs to
forget his problees; it is a sort of escape. his recovery is sore difficult
because he influences others. creating trouble. For that reason. the work
with the hoeosexuel youth is done wore on the outside level. on the basis

of contracts in the street end the distribution of guidance leaflets.

35
"hen he is sent to Youth Challenge. the addict goes through an initial inter-
view where he "generally openly" explains his conflicts. After that. he
stays in a place in Sobradinho for 15 to 20 days where he is screened.

During that period he becomes aware of the progrsa presented by the institu-
tion. A first phase of the treatment is spiritual therapy. "the struggle

to elisinate the reasons that led his to drugs end/or hososexualtiy." con-
ducted for 3 months. During that period. the boys stay in a country house
in the rural area of the Federal District and the girls in the Hansoes
Parkway sector.

The next step is occupational therapy. "6 months of constant daily activity
at which time they take vocational training courses and perform work in the
home so that the individual will have a new ideal of life and will change as
a whole.“ The boys are transferred during that 6-aonth period to Planaltina.

About 700 youths have already passed through Youth Challenge in the past 6
years. It is recognized as a public service institution and is registered
with the National Council of Social Service. Approxisately 70 percent of
its inmates have returned home rehabilitated. A large part of them become
‘Nworking personnel." working with the new inmates after appropraite train-
ing.

Financial Difficulties

Youth Challenge has monthly expenditures of 150.000 cruseiros. Bach youth
costs the institution 1.500 cruzeiros per month. that soney is obtained
from contributing membership cards. personal donations of senators and
deputies. and government subsidies for sasll projects. in addition to pro-
notional work by society ladies. Nevertheless. the asount received is in-
adequate and the directors are struggling with great difficulties.

"we are carrying out a superhusan effort for 200 or 300 youths. The pro-
liferation of drugs is much greater and for that reason we at Challenge are
not going to miniaise the problem." Caldino said. He declared that the con-
clusion they have reached is that the ever-increasing nusber of addicts in
Brazil and in brasilia requires that a new position be taken by all Brazilians.
by the government. and by the organizations connected with the problem.

One of the ways found by Youth Challenge is that of prevention. A course of
fnnily education was given in recent weeks to 50 couples of the most diverse
social levels. There they studied the subjects: psychology of development.
religion and fasily. sass coanunications. and drugs. At the end. a dis-
cussion of the conclusions of the parents showed the need for expanding the
course and the "enormous educational role that belongs to the fasily."

From January to December of next year. family education courses will be given
every nonth to 100 couples at a time. who will later discuss the subjects
covered with couples in their block. A center for the rehabilitation of
sinors is another proposal sade by Challenge.

Pontaine showed news-en a thin slip of paper-«inner to wallpaper—with
saall squares. indicating that there was one dose of LSD in each of then.
for a naxieun of five persons. Ila added that this drug is also being pushed
in "scotch tape, little sugar bags. and stuck to steaps."

Investigat ion

0n the basis of intonation received by the technical advisory section of
08-7. to the effect that detainees Buschannn end Cotter were drug suppliers

in the eastern part of the capital, an investigation was launched to establish
the correctness of this infornetion. A surveillance and tailing operstion
was launched for this purpose with positive results. At about 2200 last
Monday. in Pare de Apoquindo, Juan Carlos Buschnenn de Santos was arrested;

in his possession. in hie trouser pocket. officers found 29 doses of 1.80
which. as he contested. he was bringing for sale enong consuaers in the area.

On being questioned. Busehnann said that he had received 60 doses of LSD

fro- Ateaga "so that. together with Cortes. they would be handling $50 pesos
worth each."

investigators went to the boss of Ateaga. accompanied by Uuschnann, in order
to find the exact place where the rest of the drug was being hidden. Once
they arrived there. they questioned Ateaga who was ecconpanied by Cortes.
Both adaitted their guilt. Police officers confiscated 1.667 doses in the
building. canouflaged as Christaes cards iron the United States.

According to investigators. Ateage confessed that he entered the country on
18 Deceaber after having spent 6-1: years in the United States. as added
that "before going to Chile, I contacted a United States trafficher in the
city of San l’rencisco. California. free when I bought the LSD." ~

The Court

Personnel froa 03-7 announced that the confiscated drugs were turned over to
the pharaaceutical section of the National health Service and that the

detainees were turned over to the Sixth Criminal Higher Court of Santiago
which will handle the trial.

Lt Col Luis Pontaine said that "1.81) is a drug classified as a hallucinogen
whose use in medicine had to be stopped due to the danger it constituted in
the treatment of patients who suffered serious psychopathic disorders and
changes. Scientific inwastigstore recently found out that the use of LSD
causes serious disturbances, both physiological and psychological. “the
effect of a small dose of approxinately 0.12 nilligraas lasts about 56 hours
in terns of organic changes and transformation: individuals go through the
stages of etimlation, hallucination. and depression and these generally
lead the consuaing individuals on to suicide."

0“
The police chief added that "it is not necessary to take LSD orally since it
suffices to hold it between the thumbs for an interval of 30 seconds to get
the same intoxication through osmosis."

”Just 3 hours after consumption," he said, there are disturbances in per-
ception, called syneathesia and paresthssin which change the sense of
vision and hearing. The body goes to sleep. along with hallucinations,
including visions, and the individual may believe that he is performing
physical acts that are beyond normal. The chromosome damage produces by
LSD could be compared to the consequences deriving during the decade of the
sixties from the use of Thalidomide, when children were born with morpho-
logical changes."

NARIHUANA LmALIZBD NR SOME USES
Bogota BL TIBMPOJn Spanish 6 Dec 78 p a-e

[Article by Israel 3. Arenas: "my Clear for Several Uses of
Marihuana")

[Text] The Bogota Superior Court tacitly accepted the use of teari-
huana for therapeutic purposes-ocmcretely for the treateent ot arth-
ritis-"by acquitting a noun who had 7 pounds or urihuana in her
possession to use for the disease.

The court i'elt that the drug law was not violated by the possession
or narihuana tor a method that has becone con-on in colodoia: the

use or the drug in baths and ointnente to alleviate the pains of
arthritis and sinilar diseases.

The use or Iarihuanao-not to snoke but to rub it onuwae verified in
the specific case or the mean through a study made by forensic
doctors.

Judge Pantaleon Mejia Garzon carried out the legal study because of
a trial in which a soean had been sentnced to la aontlu in prison.

According to what was verified, the accused had acquired 7 pounds of
the well-known and dangerous drug in order to use it in baths to cure
arthritis, a disease that had been diagnosed by the doctors and was
verified by the government forensic doctors.

when her spurned lover denounced her, the man was indicted and the
judge of the third Crininal court in Bogota iqaosed the sentence of.
la months in prison.

‘J"
For several years there has been the belief that earihuana dissolved
in alcohol is an ideal reaedy to alleviate the pains oi' arthritis.

66
Many people on all social levels use narihuana in cintnents and plas-
tere in order to "numb” the pain.

It must be pointed out that marihuana--banned in the United States
and Colombia because of its terrible errect on addicts-~is being
tested therapeutically for different diseases. In North Aurica, for
example, there have been tests in glaucoma cases and some cases of
“was

or course, the possession of large quantities of marihuana--even if
the owner alleges that he is arthritic-do punished as a violation of
the drug law.

The court has ruled now on the case of a sick woman who had acquired
7 pounds of narihuana to use as eedicine.

The woman, sick with arthritis, despaired at the futility of conven-
tional aedical treataents and decided to obtain marihus-na in which
to bathe herself.

One day the lady quarreled with her lover and he, angry, decided to
denounce her to the authorities for possession of narihuana. Her
house was surrounded and the 7 pounds were found, of course.

The woman was arrested and tried for violating Decree no or 1974--
that is, the drug law.

The judge or the Third Criminal Court in Bogota sentenced the sick
woman to 1!: years in prison. ‘rhe case reached the crininal division
or the Superior Court and was assigned to Judge Pantaleon Mejia Gar-
zon. He consulted forensic doctors about the therapeutic uses or
narihuana in relation to arthritis.

The forensic doctors responded: "The use of marihuana in the treat-
ment of arthritic or similar problem is not accepted in therapeutic
medicine even though it is used for these objectives."

Judge mjia canon, making an overall study or the case, reached the
conclusion that the drug law had not been violated and, consequently,
it was wrong to sentence her to 18 months in prison.

For this reason the sentence was revoked and she was acquitted.

Thus the use of marihuana was practically authorized by judicial
authorities...but only for bathing.

[Text] Barranquilla, lo Dec-oﬂugo Bacobar sierra, sinister of justice,
confiraed here that "aarihuana cultivation and traffic have destroyed
agriculture in La Guajira. We can no longer find even one yucca on
the peninsula."

Bsccbar sierra said that the eastern plains have also been converted
into a paradise for narihuana traffickers and stated that it is cul-
tivated and sold there although on a saaller scale than in La majira.

Also he said that the govermssnt forces have discovered lore aeri-

huana fields and clandestine airports in the plains and La majira.
He challenged the gangsters and said: "We are sure of winning this
battle. They will see."

he minister of justice announced here that the state of siege that
has been in effect in the country for 5 years would be lifted in the
aiddle of next year once the new Penal Code and the refora of colon-
bian justice go into effect.

‘rhe minister stressed the problems of La Guajira. He said that
President mrbay Ayala has appointed eight ainisters to go to the
peninsula and evaluate the true situation on the spot.

He said that sees clandestine airports are being destroyed but others
that are in better technical condition than the legitimate airports

will be used as stopover airports for flights abroad, duly supervised
by the govern-nt.

"Imagine," he said, "agriculture has been destroyed in La majira.
The problen is so serious that there is no longer even one yucca
(nanioc) in La Guajira."
Concerning the situation of Justice, the courts and jails in Colombia,
the minister indicated that with the reform of justice and the Penal
Code and Code or criminal Procedure, "we will correct many errors,

my gaps. "

He announced that 80 aillion pesos will be allocated {or the rehabi-
litation, expansion and construction of new jails.

He lamented the depressing state of the courts and the delay in pro-
ceedings but he optimistically recalled: "We will correct all that."

The minister pointed out that sons lawyers exploit the gaps in pre-
sent Colcmbian legislation to defend traffickers and give an honest
appearance to crimes that are not included in our codes. Thus it is
urgent to reform Colombian Justice so that the new crises that led
to a new public safety law do not remain untouched by justice.

Rscobar Sierra ended his dialog with BL TIBIPO stating: "Do not think
that the United States directed and advised us to pronulgate the
public safety law. You can be sure that it was an autonomous and
courageous position or decision by our president, Julio Cesar mhay."

CAMPAIGN COORDINAIOR DBSCRIBBS ANTIDRUC POLICY
Culiscan BL son 02 SINALOA in Spanish ll Dec 78 p 6

[Text] "The use of medium and high-powered weapons is always associated with'
the drug traffic. and this is what has forced the Federal Judicial Police to

wage a relentless battle against this activity. which is what we are trying
to eradicate.

"Therefore. we sometimes have to hold individuals who have violated the law
for longer periods of time, in order to complete the prelininary investiga-
tion and subsequently place them at the disposal of the court. But this is
not a general rule to be followed in all instances. and we close some records
when we feel that all the evidence has been found and that all that needs to
be done is to arrest the accomplices of the individual in custody."

These remarks were addressed to the members of the Bar Association by Crux
Lope: Garza, coordinator of the Permanent Campaign Against the Drug Traffic
in Zone 06. who stressed the fact that his only concern is to combat the
highly dangerous crime against health in its various degrees.

”A charge has been made by Federal Judicial Police Coadr Juan Jose Hernandez
del Castillo to the effect that there are other entities in the state and
that. every time they make an arrest they claim to be members of the 'Fede-
ral Judicial Police;' something which we are normally forbidden to do, be-
cause our work consists solely of arresting those reported to us through the
pertinent warrant for their arrest.”

Lopez Garza explained: "We are particularly concerned with arresting persons
in coapliance with arrest warrants or who have been caught in the act; and.
thanks to this. it has been possible to issue orders for official imprison-
ment in 98 percent of the cases. and hence reduce second offenses related

to crises against health in 65 percent of the cases.

“There has always been an attempt to make the Federal Judicial Police forces
appear to be a group of heartless gorillas, and it has sometimes been said
that a group of ballet dancers cannot be sent to combat the drug traffic;
and therefore, out of 500 charges made against us for different reasons. on-
ly two or three at the most are warranted.

S3
"Some of the most recent orders that have been received are to srraign those
who have been arrested when any of the legal degrees of crime can be proven
against then. and to hold then for trial; and to release those against who-

no charges can be proven. but without neglecting to make the preliminary
investigation."

CAUSES O? ADDICTION IN CHILDRBN DISCUSSED
Mexico City IL 80% DB MEXICO in Spanish 16 Nov 78 pp A-b, A-lO
[Krticle by Hector Solis Quirog§7

[Icrg/ There is great concern in knowing how to prevent drug addiction
among children and adolescents. To prevent means to lake preparations
in advance to prevent a danger. Therefore, true prevention is based on
a knowledge of the causes and the nanner in which to combat those causes.

If we consider that every child normally requires love and family care and
that he should not only be given what he needs but required, from early
childhood on, to nest an increasing series of obligations, we shall realise
that, without those factors, he or she will not be happy. This happens when
a child lives with a family which is licentious, indifferent, tyrannical.
aggressive, in constant conflict or criminal, a fanily which abuses the child
or abandons him or overprotecta hi. preventing hin from developing. There
we have one of the causes of drug addiction in the nidat of childhood or
adolescenceo-na-ely, the desire to flee from reality.

A large portion of the population is guilty of this type of conduct within
the hone, and this hates the child by leaving him or her unprepared for
marriage and parenthood.

The proper policy would be to prepare people from those two functions by in-
corporating in the school curricula, from kindergarten through highschool,
teaching that would be suitable for the pupil's age and develop-eat level
and which would deal with the reality of the home and the manner in which

to resolve various types of probleaa.

when children do not go to school and, much less, learn to engage in an oc-
cupation in accordance with their capabilities and interests, they become
afflicted with idleness, which is another substantial cause of drug addic-
tion, especially since it is associated with problems such as the advantage
the family takes of the child, dropping out of school, running away iron
hone, dangerous friendships and others. Other causes of a child's idleness
are fanily disorganization, the lack of paternal control over the child's

55
attendance at school, the lack of proper accomplishment of school work, the
need to go to work at an early age or be out on the streets, the mother's
absence in the home, and the lack of child recreation centers near the place
of residence. The solution to this cause is particularly adequate prepara-
tion of the married couple for their function as parents.

Another principal cause of drug addiction among children and adolescents is
curiosity which incites, basically the adolescent, to experience the effects

of drugs which 'his friends" use, of those which are more extensively adver-
tised or about which more is spoken. They are unaware of the fact that once
they have used certain substances they are no longer able to control their

own will and free themselves from the drug, if they are not assisted in time
by someone. This can be prevented by carefully supervising the child's friend-
ships.

Finally, one of the most important causes is group pressure in highschools
(secondary, prevocational, normal, preparatory or vocational) consisting of
the fact that the bad students of each school meet to "get hig ” on drugs.

In seeking other "converts," they prevail upon some of their companions to
take drugs and do not leave them alone until they have tried what suits them
best. The best way to prevent this cause is to have good school organization
which keeps an eye on the more secluded areas of the schoolyard and discovers
the traffickers operating in those areas, who are trying to get others to use
drugs. Paternal vigilance over anyone suspected, together with school vigi-
lance, is the most effective way to combat this cause, especially if an ef-
fort is madc to keep the young people occupied by serious application to their
studies.

We do not pretend to have exhausted all the causes of drug addiction among
children and adolescents but only the main ones and the simplest methods of
prevention. Our objective is to give guidance to parents, as we know that
this problem is particularly pronounced in large cities. Surely, it will
not be difficult to prepare parents, if they themselves are convinced. It
is much more complicated to incorporate such preparation in the educational
programs of the entire population, but this task is not difficult, once our
educational leaders are convinced of that need. What is difficult is to
convince them of that need.

DRUG ADDICTION AMONG CAPITAL STUDENTS DBPLORBD
Mexico City METROPOLIDB EL DIA in Spanish 23 Nov 78 p ll
[Article by Eva Leonor Manda: Cobo§7

[Sexé7 In the last decade drug addiction among children
has increased approximately 600 percent. According to
recent statistics, about 20 percent of the school children
in primary and secondary schools use some type of drug or
have tried drugs. Jose Luis Bsquedo suggests the estab-
lishment of orientation centers and social prevention
centers in strategic points of the city.

The Federal District is the Guyana of suicide for a large number of youth
and children who, attacked by misery, hunger and unemployment, fall into
the clutches of vice, according to a statement made to METROPOLI by Jose
Luis Esqueda, investigator for the Metropolitan Autonomous University.

Esqueda pointed out that the news of the group suicide of 609 inhabitants
of Jonestown, Guyana, stunned the world. On the supposition that this
news is entirely a social phenomenon, sociologists and anthropologists
need to deal with this subject.

'1his tragedy,” he added, ‘ht many kilometers distance horrified us, without
even thinking that it happens every day in our own capital of Mexico and
that frequent reports in the agencies of the Public Ministry of this great
city speak of the death of a child or adolescent who has swallowed, smoked
or inhaled some narcotic or drug losing his life in an aberrant suicide.

”This slow death in the world of drugs," Esqueda continued, "is viewed with
indifference. And this annihilation of the new generations passes unobserved
before our people. There are groups of citizens who organize and make pro-
tests about smog, noise, road congestion and overpopulation without even
taking into consideration the fact that a great movement is taking place
carrying on a spirited charger the new apocalyptic rider of drugs, who is
naturally dragging many adolescents and children caught in his path (with-
out complaint or angry voices) into the worst vices, and this becomes a

part of the indifference of the metropolis."

57
Drug Addiction Among 20 Percent of Students

After pointing cut that 20 percent of those attending primary schools
and highschools in the Federal District take some form of drugs, Esqueda
Gutierrez stated that Mexico City, like all large cities in the world,
also has this problem which can only be analysed through studies made

on the subject.

"In a city like ours," he added, 'with more than 18 million inhabitants,
we can understand that problems unavoidably exist among the children and
youth; but what we cannot understand in regard to these emerging genera-
tions is their inclination toward and addiction to narcotics and drugs

as formulas of self-indulgence and solution to their problems, which pseu-
do intellectuals have attempted to justify in their own weakness as an
escape from social and human reality.

"In this adventure of foolhardiness and imitative snobbery we are encoun-
tering statistics just as alarming as the suicide of the fanatics of the
People's Temple sect. A conservative estimate puts the rise in drug ed-
diction during the last decade at 600 percent, and we may well ask from
where such a volume of drugs is coming.

'Oistribution networks have been discovered extending from the states of
sinaloa and sonore to Jslisco, Hichoscen and Oaxaca. The intention is to
be closer to a vast market such as that of the Federal District. Here the
centers of education have become centers of commercialization; naturally,
we are speaking of merchandise such as Indian hemp and psychotropic drugs,
substances which are mostly consumed by students through distribution by
organized groups, by ”promoters" of questionable existence."

In a sententious manner our interlocutor continued: "And as if the pre-
ceding were somewhat the vortex of this great asphalt jungle, it has given
rise to a commerical median for 'little users.‘ And when we speak of
'little,' we mean children varying from 6 to lb years of age. In this
commercial median of inhalants. which naturally is not a median in regard
to its profits which are enormous, we find the complacency of those who
should take part in the affair.

"From day to day disguised bakeries are set up, some flagrantly, for the
sale of inhalants in improvished areas, such as nearby La Merced and
Garibaldi, two definite examples which many newspapers have already
pointed out in no uncertain terms. The poisoners of these children

have realized additional profits by installing facilities and shenties
for the protection of those consuming this drug which destroys the lung
and brain cells causing extremely seriOus damage. In this manner, in-
nocent children can become drugged without observation or interference."

58
Solution

when Baqueda was asked for a possible solution to this serious problem,

he answered: "In the face of this collective suicide through which ad-
dicted adolescents and children will somehow meet their death or unbal-
anced mental condition through their own desire or through the influence
of others, we have only to ask our authorities, in this case the city
manager, Prof Hank Gonzalez, via‘the Directorate of Social Services and
General Medical Services, for the establishment of guidance centers_and
prevention centers in key_points and in coordination with the DI? [federal
Division of Investigatiogl. This organization's interest in children's
welfare has been indicated in the form of supervising, counteracting and
guiding parents, children and adolescents in school centers with systems
which, far iron generating curiosity, fully clarify the serious dangers
involved and stressed that the ideal solution would be to get rid of the
social evils which lead to aberrations and distortions of the personality.
But knowing that that hedonism is utopian, we perfer to ask the authori-
ties, anong when we must include the Legislative Power, to revise and

legislate greater punishment for those who manufacture this collective
suicide.

Lﬁxg7 A shipaent of 150 kg of pure cocaine, valued at about 3 billion
pesos, was aeized by the office of the Attorney General of the Republic

on a clandestine airport runway in the Chiapss forest near the matenslan
border.

The drug, transported frost Colo-bis to chiapas, was in a twin-engined plane
manned by two persons, who were arrested.

six persons had previously been arrested in the Federal District by agents
under the orders of Good: Plorentino Ventura and by Javier Coello Trejo, an
agent of the Pederal Public Ministry.

The arrests were made through information given by Interpol to Florentino
Venture, who is one of the head commanders of the Federal Judicial Police
and director of Interpol in nexico.

This eVent was tensed the most important of its kind made by Oscar Flores
Sanchez, attorney general of the republic.

According to intonation issued by the Federal Judicial Police, investiga-
tions under the orders of Gen Raul Mendioles Cerecero had been going on for
6 months, but it was not until 10 November that it was possible to discover
the activitiea of the international drug trafficker, Alvaro Cardenas Anays.

Various judicial agents, in coordination with Jesus Meixueiro. also a chief
couander of the Federal Judicial Police, kept close watch on Cardenas Anaya
in order to find out who were hie contacts.

Thus. it because known that Alvaro had met with Jairo Parts, Luis Crespo
Rodriguez and Jose Audel Valdovino Holina, part of a band that has connec-
tions in five countries.

Once arrested, they had informed the police that a twin-engined plane

coming free Colombia would arrive at a clandestine runway in the Chiapas
forest near the Guatemalan border.

There the agents captured aviators Bernardo Martinez Navarrete and Marco

froa Coadr Moreno ﬂernandez arrested the brothers Alejandro and Jesus Hora
Rolon in a 1978 Rainer with Federal District license plates on Revolucion

of the ring. Pedro Joaquin Guzman Colin. in a 1973 Pontiac with California
license plates 218-6” in the parking lot of the "La Sierra" Hotel, and he
was found to have a shipaent of 10 kilogram of cocaine in his possession
as well.

Pros this capture of Guzman Colin information was obtained which resulted
in another seiaure of 13 kilogram of cocaine in Tapachula, Chiapaa. last
Sunday afternoon. after it had been established that all these confiscated
drugs originated in Colombia. and were taken to “series via Guatemala.

In Tapachula, Gustavo Gonzalez, about 30 years of age. was arrested. and con-
fessed that this ring had been operating for over 6 months. during which time
it had managed to make eight similar trips froa Guatelama to Tijuana. froa
which the drugs were taken to the United States.

65

"Maya Excelsior" hotel in Guatemala, which he left last Sunday and was then
intercepted in Tapachula in a Gremlin car.

Aguilar Garza noted in conclusion that, thanks to these arrests. inforaation

has been obtained on accomplices of this ring. both within the Republic of
Mexico and abroad.

Except for Gustavo Gonzalez. who was arrested in Chiapas, the brothers Ale-
jandro and Jesus Hora Rolen. and "chief" Pedro Joaquin Guzman Colin. are

POLICE PROTECTION CNARGED--The Federal Judicial Police have been concealing
the identity of two individuals who were arrested with aarihuana together
with Napoleon Avila Leija, alias "Bl Oso." The foregoing was reported by
sources associated with that group. who noted that there is suspicion of
irregularities surrounding those arrests. possibly to protect those who are
behind the drug traffic. [Section of text illegible] because everyone knows
that the marihuana is not being produced there. but is carried froa Mexico
to the United States. The way in which the work is being done is interest-
ing. but in an irregular manner. particularly when the Federal Judicial Po-

gether with Napoleon Avila Leija. "81 One." whose name was the only one dis-
closed. although all three were caught with marihuana in their possession.
Now then. it has been well publicized that it was not the Federal Judicial

State Judicial Police. who turned over the three arrested individuals and
the marihuana to the Federal Judicial Police. thus conplying with the regu-
lation that they are not to certify nor intervene in matters that are the

l‘nextl when he had already returned to Uruguayan territory, after 10 months
of living underground. a drug trafficker whose arrest was ordered last Jan-
uaryntas apprehended in Oerro Largo Department, more specificially in Rio
Branco, by police officers in that border town. ‘l'hey rapidly turned hil
over to the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Brigade. The individual, iden-
tified as Victor Daniel olivera Rodriguez. alias "Cache,” Uruguayan citi-
sen , single , 23 years old, whose last residence in Uruguay was recorded at
934 Seriano Street, in the city of hontevideo, had been sought since the
middle of January by the First Session Trial Court.

The reader will recall that a huge operation by the Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs Brigade began on the last day of 1977. 'l'nis operation led to the in-
prisonnent of almost 100 traffickers and addicts. In addition . large
amounts of psychopharnacological drugs and hallucinogenics were seized.
Snell narihuana plantations‘were also found in possession of the defendants.
but. owing to our country's climate, they had not developed as they thought.
Nevertheless. sons of the plants exceeded 1.2 meter in height. ‘lhis indic-
cated that sufficient 'grass" could be derived from then for use by a vast
group of local addicts.

The indictments handed down in due tine were described as an unprecedented
judiciary police task, because the whole underworld engaging in traffic
.and use of drugs was stirred up by the police action, which did not leave
a single brothel undisturbed or a six.,1e hideout unraided. Some succeeded
in escaping, including Olivera Rodriguez, but, apparently, not for long.

The prismer,‘ who is said to have admitted his crimes, in spite of the
fact that police secrecy prevented an abundance of details. is responsible
for the entrance into our country of several shipments of narihuana coming
frost Paraguay and Brazil. The trips as well as the purchase of the hallu-
cinogenicwere financed by Carlos anesio Maisonnave, still a fugitive. who
was in charge of distributing narihuana. suitably “out.“ anong us.
Victor Daniel Olivera Rodriguez,
apprehended after remaining a
fugitive {or over 10 months.

olivera Rodriguez said that, when he learned that he was wanted by the Nar-
cotics Brigade -- actively engaged in rounding up traffickers and users --
he fled to Porto Alegre. on 11 January. There, he lodged in the Hotel
Chicago. on Garibaldi Street. but he must have changed lodging several
times, owing to the frequent raids carried out by the Rio Grande du Sul
police. Although the Brazilian officers were seeking criminals and in—
dividuals without documentation that would allow them to stay in Brazil,
Olivera was afraid that his status as a fugitive for the crime of drug
trafficking might be known and this gave rise to his nervousness that
finally led his to flee to the country where his arrest had been ordered
precisely.

He admitted to the Uruguayan authorities who arrested him as soon as he
set food on Uruguayan territory that he had made several trips to Paraguay
paid and ordered by Temesio Maisonnave, bringing in several kilograms of
marihuana. He also said that he ”worked“ for Gonzalo Garreta and Eduardo
Cattami, already tried. He had even gone so far as to go to Brazil with
prescriptions falsified by Carlos Alberto Gomez Martinez.

When he discovered that the prescriptions were not valid. he decided to buy
the psychophernacological drugs in Montevideo -- with those false prescrip-
tions -- and, once in Brazil, he exchanged then for narihuana that he then
brought to Uruguay.

motley, Olivere Rodriguez will be taken before the first eeseion trial judge
who will eurely order him remanded to prison. It should be pointed out that.

[Article by Jens holsoe: "Copenhagen To have lhree New Narcotics Centers"!

[Text] After new year, Copenhagen will establish three methadone clinics,
where 6 or 5 social workers, four physicians, and one psychologist will
treat the 12!. narcotics addicts for which the municipality assumed responsi-
bility when the health authority closed down Dr ole hjort's private netba-
done maintenance establishent.

with the setting up of these three methadone ciinics decided upon on Friday
and announced yesterday, the nunicipality of Copedsagen has very drastically
changed the previous treatment policy. It has led to numerous protests by
physicians and others involved in the problem.

City l'hysicisn a. B. xnipschildt stated yesterday that Chief Physician Preben
Preitag has been appointed to head the three clinics. For the time being
they will function for six months, but the chief physician thinks they nay
be open for a longer period. Preitag has been given a leave of absence fro-
the crieinal administration.

1he municipality will very shortly have to find premises for the three
clinics, where daily doses of methadone are to be distributed to the addicts.
One of the clinics will probably be located in a store in the inner city,
where freitsg has treated a snail number of addicts.

Before the city decided to establish these three clinics, attempts had been
nade to find possibilities for treatment in, anong other places, the
psychiatric sections of Gopedtagen's hospitals. Here, cooperetion was
refused. The psychiatric physicians offered 10 days of reintegration which
the city physician rejected.

‘lhe social workers of Copednagen's treatment centers are outraged by the
decision, feeling that the work they are carrying on of reintegration and
resocialisation of the addicts will be undermined by the new policy. Last
night, Dr Preitag said to Pour!!!“ that with the decision made, he hoped
that cooperation would be possible. "the unfortunate situstion of the
addicts is at stake," he said.

Oslo mmm in Norwegian 29 Dec 78 p 2

[53:57 "It is a known fact that strychnineuor rat poison--is being nixed
with heroin for sale on the street." said Police Adjutant Per Carlson of

the Oslo police department. "In Den-ark they have known of this for several
years. He have also confined the presence of strychnine in the heroin
here in Norway at the tine of a drug-related death." Carlson nsde this
consent on a report fron the Norwegian Public health Institute to the effect
that there was strychnins in confiscated heroin that the police seized
before Christ-as.

Police Adjutant Carlson enphasized that this batch which was analyzed has
no connection with the five drug-related deaths in Oslo in the weeks before
Christ-as.

"There have been sore seizures in connection with the deaths. These seizures
are being analyzed and the police have not yet been inforned of the results.
He are also awaiting the autopsy reports before we can be sure." said Carlson.

According to the newspaper MSW the Norwegian Public health Institute
has found between one and two percent of strychnine in the batch which has
been tested. The substance is very dangerous, and 10 niligrsne is the nost
that a hunn can tolerate.

”Regarding the deaths before Christmas. it is too early to say anything with
certainty. The cause of death could also have been stolen pharneceuticals

such as nethadone. He have several unsolved phsrnscy break-ins which nethadone
(n synthetic opium-like substance) and other drugs were stolen. It is known
fro. past experience that overdose of this substance cause the death of

those who have taken it." said Carlson.

“Is heroin new generally available in Oslo?"
"Unfortunately, heroin has becone tore and more available. Drug addicts

pay sky-high prices for it. In a recently coqleted'case i t was learned
that the price of heroin was between 5,000 and 10,000 kroner per gran

The perente couitted their minor eon to the Xerl-Bonhoeffer Mental
ﬂoepitel ("Bonnie‘e Ranch"). In the eecurity ward, along echizophrenice,
elcoholice and epileptice (eeye Allert: "They were loaded with druge and
not reeponeive at all"), the drug addict felt everything to be "totally
enpty; everything went wrong there."

Upon hie releaee, the addict wee ettrected to a women junkie who had a
child, and he wee ”quickly hooked again." Allert dealt end etole-che once
etole a W bue containing a ehipuent of chunpegne, in order to be able to
buy the heroin he needed. During a withdrewel attempt at home, he beat up
the child very badlyo-end wee again couitted to "bonnie'e Ranch."

Since allert now faced criminal proceedinge ae well end eince he wanted to
get out of the Ranch, but did not went to go to jail, he applied for ad-
nieeion to a rehabilitation comune. The drug addict preeented hileelf at
e llannover conune, in which there wee unfortunetely no opening. "You
finally neke up your mind to do eouething," eeid Allert reeignedly, "and
then you find youreelf on waiting liet number eo-and-eo."

Like Allert, many other drug eddicte in the Federal Republic who want to
give up the uae of the drug are given the wrong directione or etelled off.
Thoee who once found the-eelvee in a eecurity ward or who were denied ed-

the public reet roae in the city, the retreat for the eecret fix.

On three occeeione, Selle ODed; he deecribee the experience ee followe:

I felt e etabbing pain in the heed and I blacked out. When I one to, I

So far, only the Frankfurt cri-inal police have noticed the junkie, one of
the 1,300 eddicte of when the police maintain filee concerned with drug

police coneider him "one of the potential deed bodiee of tarot-row."

But even police officere are eonetiuee eurprieed at how eoon an addict

Bielefeld police chief, ran away from home and joined a co-une. Five

director of the Baden-Huerttenberg Parity Welfare Aeeociation: "At
preeent, 8- to 11-year-old children are entering the drug ecene."

For all their efforte, the police have not been able to curb the increee-
ing uee of heroin. During the first 6 uonthe of 1978, 130 kilogrne of
heroin were eecured by criminal police and cuetone in the Federal Repub-
lic, while during the whole year of I977 the police eeized 60 kilogra-e.
In the opinion of police officiale euch ee Kurt Bauer, the head of the
Nercotice Departlent in the Stuttgart State Criminal Police Bureau, to

epeek of "light at the end of the tunnel" ie pernieeible only, if the
dmnd can be curbed.

Concerned parente and zealous politiciane are pointing out weya of
eolving the problem According to one of the propoeele, the addicte
ehould be taken off the etreet by force. "Volunterineee in drug rehab-
ilitation ie in teeny caeee inappropriate Iiberalien," arguee the ﬂeece
Lendteg [etate legielature] deputy Rolf-Dieter Pirnheber (CDO); "after

all, cholera, typhoid or plague victine are likewiee detained againet
their will."

however, it ie not until a rieing death rate alarm the public that the
politiciane become active. In Berlin, which in 1977 recorded the

hitherto higheet drug death rate of all Federal Laender (84). the Senate
allocated thie year m 8.6 million (eix tinee ae ouch ea in the pre-

ceding yeer) for drug cmtrol--"on account of the fatalitiee," ae Theo

Looe, Berlin'e deputy drug con-ieeioner, conceded. Nevertheleee, thie
year Berlin hee again recorded 60 drug-related deathe. '

The attempte made by the authoritiee are at any rate an advance ae com-
pared to the eetbeclte which at the beginning of the drug wave at the end
of the l960'e characterized the handling of addicte. Drug eddicte eeehing

advice frequently were given nothing butan inetructional puphlet, and
veteran eocial workere found it difficult to relate to longhaired junkiee.

Some eelf-help groupe did not even atteapt to cure the addiction.

Rather, they propr~eted drug uee for the purpoee of raieing political
conacioueneee. In the Hamburg "Releaee" center (motto: "lielp youreelvee"),

the coneunption of eoft druge had long been coneidered the appropriate

99
medicine for effecting the withdrawal from hard drugs. At that time, the
hamburg drug couiseioner, Eckhard Guenther, excused the occasional
joints smoked in the "Release" center: "They have helped us by taking
50 people off the mainliner market."

In addition, there were external obstacles: In Frankfurt, a rehabilita-
tion center was smashed by a drunk notorcycle tough. In Bittenfeld in
Swabia, local politicians and parish councilors prevented the Husrttsmberg
Charity Organization from rehabilitating addicts in an old parsonage.

In Braunschwsig, the advertising organ «our: BRAUNSCMIGER recon-ended
mental institutions. The paper suggested that the addicts (“many are
worth less than Ianurs") be permitted here "mrestrained drug use until
their early death."

The first subsidies offered by the Federal Govern-ent and the Laender were
squandered rather indiscriminately: 0n tearooms, drug clinics, commas
and contact centers. By 1971, the state had subsidized 118 facilities
characterized by good intentions and a lack of expertise.

It was not until 1973 that the rehabilitation centers were given scien-
tific supportuinitially in the hope that this would lead to the develop-
ment of a generally accepted therapeutic concept. By now, however, the
Bonn drug politicians have realized that there can be no "optimal
therapy," as Minister of Public Health Antje Huber conceded; the causes
of dependence and the emotional and physical consequences of addiction
in the individual cases are too varied.

The model of the four-stage "therapy chain" is probably the most pro-
mising:

«Counseling in outpatient facilities maintained by the public health
authorities, welfare institutions or self-help groups;

«physical detoxification in a mental hospital or in the intensive care
center of a hospital (duration: 7 to 10 days);

«psychological rehabilitation in a facility removed as far as possible

from the addict's former "scene" (duration: Frequently unlimited, at
least several months);

"follow-up therapy in a connune in company with other former addicts
under the supervision of therapists and social workers.

There are weak links in this chain. While counseling centers exist in
densely populated areas, there are hardly any in rural regions. Host
counseling is usually no more than the presentation of information con-

cerning therapy. Drug experts criticize that there is hardly any
outpatient or preventive care.

According to the ‘i‘uebingen pedagogue Thiee Poerkaon, "The market of
therapeutic fecilitiee ie an open arena for all aorta of thinge." The
helpere in the churchee and welfare eeeocietione have been joined by
profiteere end miracle heelere. Religioue eecte and political fringe
groupe are likewiee interested in helping the addicte.

The Frankfurt ADK [General Health lneurence Fund]. for example, prefere
to refer ite policy holdare to the hetzfeld-Bifa "liehnenholz Hoapital" in
North Heeeeuwhich to the ﬂieebeden peychietriet Charlotte Berger 1e "at
beat a eaniteriun." Berger, the drug expert of the Heeee Hinietry of

Social welfare, eteted after a vieit to the hoepital: "For heroin ed-
dicte, thie ie uneuitable."

For teeny yeare, the "New Church of Scientology" received public funde (in
Berlin m 1.5 nillion) for ice "Narconon" therapy. By neane of devicee
euch ae the "Hubbard E-neter," the church epoetlee tried to break the
addicte of the herd drug habit.

In the opinion of the Berlin drug connieeioner, Holfgeng ﬂechann, Scien-
tology'e curee are "illueory; once there ie no longer any identification

with the Scientology group, the addict drope back into the drug ecene."
It wee only after alnoet all of the ﬂeet Berlin drug erperte had eharply

proteeted that "Narconon" wee etruck from the liet of organizatione to be
eubeidieed.

Preeently, eucceeeful rehabilitation facilitiee are characterized by one
feature in particular: ’.rained pedagoguee and peychologiete are very
etrict with the addicte. According to FEAR. mm RUNBSCW, "the hard
line ie generally accepted now." In the ‘l'u-‘uingen Drug Aid Center, where
reveille ie eounded at 5:30 -, "overeeere" appointed for that very pur-
poee aaintain diecipline.

Likewiee, etrict abetinence ie the rule in the "Brneet ﬂolmee Hoepital"
in the Allgeeu village of Leutkirch-Hinteretetten. Any noneeerntial food
or beverage ie taboo here, even candy, black tea, coffee and Coke. Thoee
who went to give up drug uee there not hand over their identification

card, driver'e licenee and check book and nuet accept bodily eeerchee as
wall ee blood and urine teete.

In the Banneneiek, Roenkennuhle, Bennigeen and Dachtmieean coenunee in
Lower Saxony, "dependence on the rehabilitation commie" ie exacted from
the drug addict; eubeequently, thie dependence ll etep by etep reduced.

“any coenunee are extremely eelective. For example, the llaburg
"Reitbrook Project" will not edait any eeriouely dieturbed individuele,

or pereone facing criminal proceedinge end "the proepect of a jail
eentence." According to peychologiet Lieelotte Bruening of the Goetzing

"Day Top" Center in Upper Bavaria, it ie eeeentiel "that the euffering
be intenee."

101
The Berlin phyeician Werner Middendorf expleine the concept: The addicte
nuet learn “to endure everyday etreee. They muet no longer be allowed to
give themeelvee up to the quaei-maternal protection of the drug."

Coneequently, in the inetitutione there remeine only a narrow margin
between barely permieeible tolerance and moet eevere treatment. In
Holfemueneter Caetle in Lower Prenconieo-which an a "long-term rehabilita-
tion program" (duration: 9 to 12 monthe) ie representative of the etrict
approacho-the peychologiete take their patiente to the upper limit.

Thie begine at the time of admieeion. The newcomer met convince the

Thoee who peee the teet eubmit to etrict regulatione: During the firet

zinee. mueic and TV are taboo. whoever leavee the caetle area. ie ex-

tube." Recorde and radio are permitted only at the eecond etage. after

epproxinetely 3 monthe; recorde reminiecent of the "ecene " remain on

Aeide from mercileee group diecueeione. the therapy ineludee hard agri-

Holfemueneter therapiet hack concedee that "at eome time or other everyone

In fact. many do end the coneequencee are frequently fatal. "Sometimee

"Synanon" rehabilitation center. After prolonged abetinence, the firet fix

and if neceeaary by force. After all. aaya "unite, "it to not adniaaible
to let a hulan being periah thanha to our deciaion not to do anything"
(eee interview p U.) [not reproduced].

The theaia advanced above all by therapiata and aocial workera to the
affect that only thoaa who come of their own accord can be cured (Th-a:

”That'a not amething I can accoupliah with a whip in a cloud roan") ia
to be dee-phaaixed.

For ease medical experta argue that any addicta are no longer capable of
making rational deciaiona. Saya the heaae drug coniaaioner, Charlotte
Berger: "Aa far aa their deciaion making ia concerned, they are like
babiea who juat ait there waiting to be fed." Likewiae, lleaae'a uiniater
of aocial welfare. Armin Clauaaualarued by the increaae in drug-related
deatha--recently appealed to the courte and the public welfare depart-ante
not to ehrink back any longer from forcible co-itnenta. no far aa the
legal aituation ia concerned, auch a atep could be juatified.

According to the otate lava concerning the detention of eick individuala.
drug addicte can be couitted to a aecurity ward, if they endanger their
fellow citiaena. According to the Ileaae Detention Lav, continent ia aleo
peruiaaible, if the addicte repreaent ”a danger to thenaelvea” and if
"the danger ie conaiderable and not avertible by other seam."

however, the courta uaually exarciae reatraint when an adliniatrative
body requeata the eminent c‘. an end ngered addict. The Dueeaeldorf
State Court of Appeal, e.g. doea not conaider ”an addict'a unpredicta-
bility" aufficient grounda for conic-ant.

‘i'he Irankfurt State Court judgea prefer to leave the addicta to their
own devicea. It wae not aufficient-othe ruling atated--"that fro. a
uedical point of view and in the intereet of the individual concerned,
early treatment ia ilporative. The addict. too, haa the conetitutional
right of individual liberty and he or ahe haa the right wrongly to plan
or conduct hia or her life."

The Frankfurt State Court conceded that a drug addict could be co-itted,
but only if there ia good reaaon to expect behavior "which endangera the

individual'a health or life in auch a way ac to interfere with law and
order"--whenever that nay be.

Time the therapiat uaually doea not get to eee the addict until he or
ahe hoe co-itted a criminal offence-which aa a rule happena rather

quickly. For even «name who heepa illegal druga excluaively for hie

Frequently, theee inetitutione do not even differentiate between addicta
