[Excerpts] V. Expansion of Imports Froa Vietnam and Problems Therewith
1. Agricultural Sector

Rice is still the largest crop in Vietnaa's agricultural production. As is
coamonly known. however. Japan has a surplus supply of rice and uses a
different type of rice for food. Furthermore, it seems that for the present
Vietnam would have difficulty constantly diverting a sizeeble amount of
rice into exports.

One of Vietnam's agricultural products other than rice is coffee. Some
1,861 tons of coffee were iaported by Japan in 1976. and 666 tons were in-
ported in 1977. All of this was unroasted coffee beans. Vietnamese coffee,
however. is used in blends and is not sold as Vietnamese coffee; further-
more. because the market price of coffee fluctuates sharply, more time will
be needed to expand and stabilize coffee imports.

Rubber was previously the dominant export of South Vietnam. but rubber pro-
duction was heavily damaged in the war. The trees in existing plantations
are reportedly old enough to be due for replacement. Japan imported 1,211

tons of Vietnamese natural rubber in 1976 and 7&6 tons (660,000 dollars) in
1977.

Vietnaaese corn drew attention in March 1977 when Zenno signed a contract
with the Vietnamese (VINAGRO-OOOP. Vietnam Federation of Agricultural Pro-
duction Marketing Cooperatives) to cooperate in the development of corn
production. In this project. Zenno was to invest 1.5 billion yen to culti-
vate corn in a hilly area 100 km north of Hanoi. and the Japanese side was
to take the produced corn at the prevailing international market price.
Some 1,000 hectares of cultivated land were under development and a harvest
of about 2,000 tons had been predicted. In August, however. the project
was suspended at the request of the Vietnamese aide. Since Zenno imports
about 1 million tons of corn annually from the United States and elsewhere.

12

to obtain even 2.000 tons would be insignificant. but corn is a product for
which Zenno relies entirely on overseas sources and Vietnam could becose a
source of production and supply.

Sunflower is one of the crops for which cultivation in Vietnan is well
suited. Cultivation of sunflowers is possible in part of the central high-
lands and in the Mekong Delta as a second crop after wet season rice. The
oil taken from sunflowers is said to be good for the body and ideal as a
food because it is ends up alsost wholly of unsaturated fate.

Vietnas also has an abundance of tropical fruits. Bananas and pineapples
can be shipped throughout the year. For purposes of exporting to Japan.
out-coapeting products of other countries and earning foreign exchange.
however. the Vietnamese products have some drawbacks in taste and shape.
The pineapples. for exasple. have a high sugar content and are sasll. Cur-
rently. pineapples are being grown in the sounteins and bananas in the
valleys in Lao Cai and Phu Tho and efforts are being soda to increase pro-
duction. In the export sarket. however. there is sharp competition froa
neighboring countries in both bananas and pineapples. Consequently. it
will be necessary to iaprovs the type of product for export. to sake prices
coapetitive by raising productivity. and to make marketing efforts appro-
priate to the export market in packaging. naming. and so forth.

Lastly. we would like to sake some mention of vegetables. Nearly all
vegetables produced in Japan can be produced in Vietnas. Furthermore.
Japan relies on imports for aaay of its vegetables in the fora of dried or
frozen vegetables. The Vietnamese Government. too. wants these exports
and vegetables are reportedly being exported to the Soviet Union (Siberia)
and Europe. Toastoes. cucumbers. puspkins and cabbages are being sent to
Siberia and this trade is fairly well established. Dried vegetables (garlic
and onions) are sent to Europe and it seems that export contracts for a
fairly large voluse have been received from Europe. In addition. processed
pepper products which are produced near Hanoi are sea; to Eastern Europe.
Vietnas. than. is actually exporting types of vegetables. For the present
however. it seems that at least for northern Vietnaa. it would be very
difficult to export products other than these.

The above is a rough survey of the possibilities for expanding exports in
the agricultural sector and. although we can indicate sufficient future
possibilities. each of the products presents various problems for the
present. Regrettably. we have to say that expanding exports to Japan will
not be easy. Vietnam ranges fro: tropical to subtropical and there are

few crops. including cash crops. which Vietnaa cannot grow. It is said to
have the best land in the world for raising sugar cane and other such crops.
Quantitatively. however. it will lag behind in competition with products of
other countries in every case. In short. large scale production on a con-
nercial basis is not being carried on. Further-ore. in the north there
seeas to be very little room for developaent of large scale production.
Consequently. we can probably say that if Vietnaa tries to gain foreign

13

reserves from exports in the agricultural sector. it will depend on agri-
cultural development of the south.

There are. than. long range prospects for import of agricultural products
from Vietnam; but. at present. Vietnam is in a transitional period and it
seems that such imports would be rather difficult for the time being.
Therefore. since Vietnam is one of the few tropical agricultural countries
among the socialist countries. it will probably continue to export to the
Soviet Union. the Eastern European countries. etc. These countries. unlike

Japan. are not so stringent about quality and standards. and are easier ax-
port targets for Vietnam.

2 . Forestry Sector

High quality pine lumber was produced in the area around Dalat in southern
Vietnam and had one of the aouth‘s main products for export to Japan before
the liberation. Japan's first imports of this item after the liberation
were in 1977. Since the policy adopted by the Vietnamese Government regard-
ing luder exports says that Vietnam will export locally milled ludier. the
pine lunber imported by Japan has also become locally sawed lumber rather
than logs. The advantage of pine ludaer for construction is the beauty of
the wood'a grain. Furthermore. for this wood to be used in construction
requires milling methods tailored for distribution of the wood in the
domestic Japanese market. Since the Vietnamese side gives little consid-
eration to this point. there are serious problem in dealing with them.
Consequently. ! t would be possible to realize imports of a fairly large
volume of pine luber if the Vietnamese side would allow exportation of
legs; but. there are milling facilities in the production area. and the
Vietnamese side seeam strongly intent on trying to raise the added value
of the primary product before exporting it.

In addition to pine. Vietnam produces a great deal of tropical lumber.
Vietnam's forests. however. suffered considerable damage in the war and
pieces of steel are iwedded in the trunks of many of the older trees.
Furthermore. it is hard to say that the facilities are in place for fell-
ing and loading this kind of lumber. Nevertheless, the demand for tropical
luder in Japan is high and Japan imports a great deal of luster from Ha-
laysia, Indonesia and the Phillippimes. Consequently. it is fully conceiv-
able that. if conditions are right in the future Japan could import this
lumber from Vietnam. too. Therefore. the types of tropical ludaer produced
in southern Vietnam are listed below for reference purposes.

3. Marine Products Sector

In the marine products sector. large quantities of shrimp are already being
imported. Shrimp have long been plentiful in Vietnamese waters and prior
to the liberation shrimp ranked with lumber as one of the main items among
Japanese imports from South Vietnam. however. because of insufficient
refrigeration facilities and insufficient care in shipping in Vietnam, the
shrimp actually bring a low price in the Japanese market. For example, in
Japan shrimp are sized by the nusber of shrimp to the pound and trading is
based on this sizing. but it is said that many of the shrimp which are sent
from Vietnam are not of uniform size. In such cases. they are traded for
as if of the smallest size and the price they bring has to be low. It is
said that because of this many of the shrimp are diverted for use in
processing or peeling. If this point were corrected and freshness were
ensured, import of a considerable volume of shrimp could be expected.

In northern Vietnam research on raising prawns is also being carried on
with the cooperation of a Japanese enterprise. The possibility of imports
developing from this later on has been reported.

In addition to shrimp there are many kinds of fish in Vietnamese waters.
For example, it is reported that many kinds of fish liked by the Japanese,
such as horse mackerel. sea bream, Spanish mackerel, and fugu swim through
Vietnam's waters. Consequently, it seems that there is a future possi-
bility of importing these fish and processed products. such as smoked
products. as well.

It goes without saying that the main import in the mining products sector
is anthracite coal. Last year 900,000 tons were imported by Japan and
this accounted for an overwhelming percentage of imports from Vietnam.
This year, however. because of a reduced rate of op;r-tion in the steel
industry due to the recession. and because of competition from other coun-
tries' products, it is doubtful we will be able to import as much as last
year. One obstacle has been the fact that because the economics of Viet-
namese anthracite coal imports are based on the mark. their price has not
dropped as much as the price of other countries' products have dropped for
Japan because of the high yen.

As indicated in the survey in the report of the Vietnam Committee in 1977,
"The Current State of Vietnam's Economic Development." Vietnam has many
mineral resources besides anthracite coal. As is conmnnly known, one re-
source considered promising is oil. After many twists and turns over de-
velopment policy following the liberation. prospecting contracts were
signed with Deminex of Heat Germany. Agip of Italy and Elf Aquitaine of
France for development of oil fields offshore from the Hakong and it seems
this development will finally start moving in earnest beginning this spring.
Since a group from Exxon and Mobil successfully discovered an oil field

offshore from the Mekong in 1975, the venture is regarded as very promising.
Japan, too. is trying to participate actively in the development; it is ex-
pected that participation in the development will probably be realized
through a credit formula. This is the method by which the Japanese side
implemented its part in oil development in Sakhalin; that is. up to 50 per-
cent of the amount produced is to be exported to Japan and a set amount is
to be handed over at a discount as payment of the interest while another
set amount goes toward repayment of the financing. In any case. the main
recipient of exports of crude oil taken from the oil fields offshore free
the Mekong will undoubtably be Japan. If large scale oil fields are dis-
covered snd it becomes possible to export large quantities of crude oil to
Japan, Vietnam's exports to Japan will expand suddenly. Of course. it has
been pointed out that there are still many unknowns and there is much work
to be done and. consequently, optimism is not necessarily possible. Since,
however. the balance in world demand for crude oil will, in the long run.
inevitably tend to be tighter. the people involved on the Japanese side
hold great hopes for this oil.

Besides oil, phosphate rock is also regarded as a promising resource be-
cause world demand for it is tight; it is hoped that phosphate rock will be
developed with Japanese cooperation.

5. Light Industry

As is shown by the fact that the majority of imports ‘rom Vietnam are
primary products. it will not be easy to expand imports in the light in—
dustrial sector. Many people point to Vietnam's technological backward-
ness as the reason for this. For example. in the field of electronics.
Vietnam will have to compete with products from Korea, Taiwan and Hong
Kong; but, in the opinion of experts, Vietnam is about 15 years behind

these countries. Furthermore, a broad base of related industries is
needed to support production of exports in such fields and this still has
not been sufficiently built up in Vietnam. The Vietnamese, however. are
said to have a fairly high level of ability to learn technology and it
seems quite possible that with technological cooperation from Japan. they
will overcome these technological difficulties in a short time.

Another thing that is frequently pointed out is that the Vietnamese are
insufficiently aware of export lurketing to expand their exports into
Western markets. This is something which is not limited to Vietnam but
inevitably occurs in the trade systems of socialist countries. In many
cases they do not easily grasp the idea of giving real consideration to
quality, packaging, delivery dates. trademarks, volume and other standards,
of winning in competition in the export market. and of encouraging a will-
ingness to buy on the part of the consumer. This is no surprise since, in
the past Vietnam's external trade has been mainly trade with socialist
countries and Vietnam has no experience of actually having expanded its
exports to market economy countries. It would. however, be desirable to
use every opportunity to approach the Vietnamese side so that their under-
standing of the Japanese market will gradually be increased.

Due to such factors as these, the best way for Japan to expand imports of
light industrial products from Vietnam would be for the Japanese side to
introduce technology and to give financial aid. There is. for example,
the reverse consignment processing formula; this was implemented several
years ago in connection with "tie-dyed fabrics." In the current situation,
it would seem desirable to put effort into expanding imports by this for-
mula. Another idea which has been brought up not only in textiles but in
the electronics field as well is for Japan to supply the parts. Vietnam to
put them together, and the Japanese side to take the products.

If this arrangement makes further progress, it in also fully conceivable
that investments would be made from Japan and products accepted under a
joint enterprise format. The Vietnamese side also hopes for investments
in their export industry and, legally. it is possible for the Japanese
side to provide 100 percent of the capital. Under this formula, it is
possible to clear all of the obstacles on the Vietnamese side in connec-
tion with technology. export marketing, capital and so forth; this would
contribute greatly to expanding exports in this sector. At present. how-
ever, there are problems such as a lack of information and some tine will
be required before expansion can be realized.

6. Energy in Vietnam. Resources:

Primary :nergy consumption shows the following trends. (Unit: percent)

1973 1975 1976

(South) (North) (Entire country)
Coal 0.0 39.0 60.0
Oil 76.6 12.0 26.6
Water Power 0.2 6.0 1.1
Plants 26.6 65.0 32.5

In the future, however. oil and gas will have to play an extremely impor-
tant role in the various sectors of the economy. In the industrial sector,
unless a considerable number of factories can change their basic fuel to
coal. the demand for petroleum products will be increasingly greater and
by 1980 may be twice what it was in 1975. In the transportation sector.
Vietnam plans to reduce the rate of motor vehicle use. increase the propor-
tion of railroad and river shipments and expand the means of voltnne trans-
port; but because overall demand continues to grow. Vietnam cannot decrease
oil consunption. Conversely, if mechanization continues in the agriculture
and fisheries sectors. these sectors will come to constitute a considerably
great percentage of the demand for petroleum products. Thus. it is esti-
mated that national demand in 1985 will be three times that of 1975 and

in 1990 will be six times the 1975 demand. -

In order to develop oil enough to meet this domestic demand and to be able
to allocate oil for export as well. it is necessary to immediately deter-
mine policies on such areas as exploration, confirmation of underground
reserves, and refining and processing of petroleum. An appropriate policy
on international cooperation must be worked cut in connection with oil
development on the basis of the principle of nut-ml equality. The petro-
leum and gas industry is a large scale industry w. i-'.‘ requires complex
technology. ranges over many fields and demands heavy i..vestment. Vietnam
is approaching oil development with the policy that in the initial stages
it will handle by itself those areas it is capable of handling. but will
promote development by concluding service contracts with foreign enter-
prises and over the next several years will expand as far as possible the
areas it can handle on its own.

The composition of future energy demand will depend on the state of devel-
opment of the national economy. but, as shown below, hydroelectric power
and coal are considered important.
