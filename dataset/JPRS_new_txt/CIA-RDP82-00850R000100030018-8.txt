NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF WOROIDGICAL FIELDS “In! USE OF SATELLITE DATA

Abstract: A study was made of the effect of joint
use of serologicsl and satellite data in a four-
dinensional analysis model [9]. The model is based
on spatial-temporal optimus interpolation. The
authors give the quantitative characteristics of
the contribution of satellite measurements in
four-dimensional analysis for the northern hemi-
sphere in specific situations. There is an anal-
ysis of the influence of ssynchronicity of observ-
stions. Evaluations of a refinement of analysis of

011388 charts are given.

[Text] The problem of initial information is one of the most important in
the numerical forecasting problem. There are different approaches to solu-
tion of this problem. The most natural way to solve it is to obtain addi-
tional information on the state of the atmosphere obtained using new ob-
servational means, such as the method of remote sounding of the atmosphere
from artificial earth satellites. The use of satellite data in a numerical
analysis of meteorological fields is associated with solution of a number
of problems. One of them is computation of the vertical distribution of
teweraturs, relative topography and humidity on the basis of radiation
neasurements from a satellite. Another equally important problem is the
development of effective methods for taking into account data on these ver-
tical profiles in numerical analysis. This problem is the subject of this

article.

Data on the vertical distribution of tewerature and relative topography.
obtained on the basis of such sounding. constitute that form of informa-
tion which, it would seem. can be used directly in nuaerical analysis. In
actuality, however, definite difficulties arise here. In contrast to trad-
itional aerological measurements, as a rule rigorously tied in to definite

geographical points and observation times. satellite data can be arbitrar-
lly distributed in time and space. Therefore, allowance for them involves

a changeover from ordinary spatial (three-dimensional) objective analysis
to four-dimensional analysis. It is important that the errors in satellite
infatuation are considerably greater than in aerological data and also that
these errors may be correlated (for example. see [10]). In this connection
there is no clear idea as to whether the mentioned satellite data are ade-
quately reliable and to what extent they can be used effectively in numer-
leal analysis and forecasting: opinions on this score are extremely contra-
dictory [2. 11-13].

Below we present the results of numerical experiments on the joint use of
aerological and satellite data in numerical objective analysis; an evalua-
tion is made of the contribution of satellite information to the results

of the analysis and an attempt is made to clarify whether this contribution
gives a positive effect.

As was already mentioned above, reference is not to computation of vertical
distributions on the basis of satellite radiation measurements. but on the
use of already reconstructed vertical profiles of meteorological elenents.
Specifically, we were concerned with the problem of assinilation of satel-
lite dnta on the relative topography of the isobaric surfaces. The corres-
ponding intonation at the present tiara is being disseminated through the
in!) global telecommunications system in the form of SAM au-ariea (earlier
8le estuaries were transnitted).

The data assimilation method is based on spatial-teqoral optimum interpola-
tion. The effectiveness of use of this approach to solution of the four-di-
mensional analysis problem was daonstrated in [8]. Different aspects of op-
timum assimilation of various kinds of information were discussed in {3,

0. 7le

The numerical experiments were carried out on the basis of the four-dimen-
sional analysis method and model developed at the USSR hydrometeorologicsl
Center. This model is based on the spatial-temporal optimum interpolation
method. It ensures joint processing of data obtained using different observ-
ation systems and having different levels of errors and it takes the correla-
tion of measurement errors into account. More detailed information on the
four-dimensional analysis model can be found in [9].

The computations were made both for cases when only aerological data were
used (variant A) and for cases of joint of aerological and satellite
neasurementa (variant AS). In each case 3’: was made of aerological infor-
nation for one observation time and satellite measurements made not more
than 12 hours from this time. Satellite information was taken from $138
su-aries received at the USSR Hydrometeorological Center. As is well known,
this information was received only for ocean areas. The number of satellite
sounding points in the northern hemisphere for a 26-hour interval averaged
about 230 and varied in the range from 190 to 336. The number of aerological

about “0 and varied fro- 411 to 680. In the computations it was assumed
that the scan relative squer rrore in eerological and satellite data on
the relative geopotential I! are equal to 0.02 and 0.10 respectively.
This Deans that in the nidd e troposphere of the temperate latitudes the
error is about 2 and 5 due. It was also assunsd that the errors in satel-
lite intonation were correlated and horizontal correlation is described

by the fornula y"): 4'70.

In the analysis we used the values v0 - 0.7; r0 - 200 he.

'Ihe analysis was eade for a regular geographic grid with 5’ intervals along
the meridian and 10° intervals along the parallel (a total of 668 points on
the nap of the northe elisphere). The results of the analysis of the

relative topography “100 presented below were obtained using data for the

period fron 26 through 29 April 1977, 13 and 14 January 1977, 23 June 1975.

use the values

The d2 value is the mean square discrepancy between the fields of the leteor-

ical elenent is approximated by a series in spherical functions

This value is conputed both for the entire considered wave spectru- and for

Now we will proceed to the results of conputations. First we will evaluate
those changes which occurred in the analysed fields as a result of taking

acteristic we will cite the outer of points of a regular grid with dif-
ferent values of the discrepancies 5 . If this number of points is deter-
mined in percent of the total number of points at which the influence of
satellite data was manifested. we obtain the following data:

The results of comparisons show that at almost 602 of the points allowance
for satellite data led to changes of 0 den or lore. the mean change was

10.6 dam, the maximum change was 35.6 dam. Thus, their quantitative contrib-
ution is extremely significant. This sale fact is indicated by the spectral

was 5.9 daaz; the maximum differences are observed in the zonal cowonent

An interesting problen is the role of ssynchronicity of observations. For
solving this problem for variant As we carried out cosputstione with and
without allowance for the differences in observation times. the results of
which demonstrated the following:

It can be seen that due to nonsllowance for differences in observation tines
in 252 of the cases discrepancies (8) arise which are more than 2 dam, in
121 of the cases .'hese discrepancies exceed lo dam, the mean discrepancy is
1.28 dam. the maximm discrepancy is 19.6 dam. Thus, even in a time inter-
val less than 12 hours one lust not neglect the differences in observation
times.

The presented data indicat hat allowance for satellite interaction sub-
stantially changes the 01' 0 charts. However, it is isporrant to evaluate
whether in actuality in th” case there is an inprovesent in the quality
of the analysis.

It is difficult to give an answer to this question: there is no standard
which should be used in a cosperison of the results of nuserical analysis.
For that reason it is necessary to seek indirect ways for evaluating the
effectiveness of this infomtion.

One of these ways is a cosputation of the a priori theoretical error in op-
tinul interpolation. For such cosputstions it is necessary to know the geo-
ursphical distribution of sounding points. the levels of errors in sessure-
nents by different observation systems and the corresponding correlation

functions. mutations of this type were cited in [6]. without dwelling on
these results in detail. we mention only that allowance for satellite data
reduces the relative square error in optimal interpolation from 0.36 to

0.18 in the northern hemisphere and fro: 0.70 to 0.30 in the southern heel-
sphere.

Another approach is based on the arbitrary choice of a standard for conpar-
ison. For example. as a standard we can elect that variant of analysis which
is assunsd to be most reliable. As such a standard we used a careful synop-
tic analysis of the OT charts for the northern hemisphere carried out at
the USSR hydroneteorolog cal Center. Tables 1-3 give the results of a con-
parison of nunerical analyses (variants A and AS) with a synoptic analysis
(variant Syn). Table 1 shows the nunber of points (x) for different grada-
tions of the discrepancies (5 ) between the analyses. The cnnparison was
made for the entire northern hemisphere. It can be seen that as a result of
use of satellite data the deviations front the synoptic analysis were sonewhat
decreased: the nean discrepancy was reduced from 6.72 to 6.07 dam, there
were approxinstely 72 fewer points with considerable discrepancies (greater
than 6 dam), and there was an increase in the nunber of points with small
deviations. Table 2 gives spectral evaluations d2. here it can be seen

that allowance for satellite data made it possible to bring the numerical
analysis close to the synoptic analysis in all parts of the spectra, ex-
cept for the nest short-wave part (m?10). Still another characteristic
which can be used is the kinetic energy of the thermal wind (Table 3).
which in the variants AS and Syn was extremely close.

As an illustration. Fig. 1 shows a chart analysed by a weatherman at the
USSR llydroneteorological Center for 0000 hours on 28 April l977 and numer-
ical analysis charts corresponding to the variants A. As and the results
of a comparison of these variants.

Allowance for satellite intonation led to substantial changes over ocean

areas and brought the analysis close to the synoptic analysis. In the re-
gion of the Atlantic Ocean to the west of Great Britain a region of cold
developed, although less deep and sonewhat displaced in conparison with
the weather-en's chart. Northeast of the shores of South Anerica the heat
ridge becane clearer. Over the Pacific Ocean, in the region of the north-
western shores of North America. in variant AS in cowarison with variant
A the analysis cane close to the weather-en's variant. The maxi-am differ-
ence between variants A and As here attains 35 den.

For evaluating the influence of satellite data on a forecast we coaputed
forecasts for 108 hours in advance using the model in ll. 6). Allowance for
satellite intonation reduced d2 iron 16.6 to 16.7 damz. however. this con-
c'luaion oust be checked on the basis of a large nuaber of cases.

lie note in conclusion that the cited results indicate the desirability of
using spatial-toporal optiaun interpolation in the iour-diaensional anal-
ysis of serological and satellite neasurements.

identity approxination. The article cites exanples
of use of the nodel for solving the problea of
weather forecasting in an adiabatic approxima-
tion for a tine up to five days.

[Text] This paper describes a nuerical model for the nodeling of the dy-
nanics of at-ospheric processes on a spherical earth in an isobaric co-

Now we will formulate the properties of the finite-difference approximation
(2.16)-(2.18).

1) Difference operators. approximrting differential operators in spatial
variables. were introduced formally. that is. scheme (2.16)-(2.18) can
be regarded as a class of schemes of different order of approximation in
Spatial variables.

2) Scheme (2.16)-(2.l7) has a law of energy conservation in the form (2.15)
for any approximations in spatial variables under the condition that expres-
unions of the same type are approximated in a uniform way. that is. this
scheme is absolutely stable in space metrics Q” (2.2).

1) Scheme (2.16)-(2.18) formally approximates problem (1.6). (1.18) with the
first order of magnitude for the variable t (which corresponds to the order
of approximation of the nonlinear operators of the initial problem by lin-
ear operators).

in order to formulate a second-order scheme in time. in (1.9) it is neces-
sary to use a second-order approximation for the nonlinear terms and pro-
ceed to the corresponding quadrature formula in time. In particular. this
is achieved by using in (1.9) an extrapolation formula in the form

and a two-cycle splitting scheme lb].

not change if in place of the grid region ON?!) in the form (2.1) we use

This numerical experiment pursues methodological purposes. In essence. in the
course of this experiment we tested a complex consisting of a model of an-
nlysis and assimilation of the initial fields of meteorological elements.
described in [9]. and the model of atmospheric dynaaice set forth in this
article. The geopotcntlal fields were stipulated at the points of intersec-
tion in a regular grid region and on the basis of the variational principle
only the wind fields were reconstructed. Since the adiabatic variant of the
model was used and no additional information was used other than the geopo-
tential field. the estimates cited in the table must be regarded primarily

as an illustration of quality of the prognostic model.

Abstract: A solution of the linear problem of
characteristic oscillations of a neutrally
stratified ataosphere with respect to adia-
batic processes on a rotating plane with per—
iodic initial conditions is described by conflu-
ent hypergeoaetric functions. The dependence of
the frequencies of wave oscillations on their
length is deterained. It is shown that allow-
once for the influence of turbulent airing has
the result that in long waves. in contrast to
short waves, a hydrostatic and quasigeostrophic
balance is rapidly established.

[Text] The hydrostaticity of large-scale ataospheric processes is a well-
known fact [1]. that is. in the third equation of action the tera with ver-

tical acceleration is spproxisately two orders of aagnitude less than each
of the two other teras in this equation. It is used constantly by aeteorol-
ogiats in their practical work. in particular. in foraulating hydrodynasic
weather forecasting aodels. However, until now there has evidently been

no discussion in the literature as to how precisely this iaportant condi-
tion is satisfied, that is. whether initially arbitrary disturbances will
becoac hydrostatically adapted and how. Below, using a simple linear hydro-
dynnaic model of the ataosphere it will be deaonstrated that an adequate
condition for the modeling of hydrostaticity is allowance for the turbulent
dissipation of energy.

We use the following concepts as a point of departure. The ataospheric
disturbances arising under the influence of different factors can be any
arbitrary disturbances allowed by the particular node]. Accordingly, solv-
ing the problem as a problea with initial data without taking the lentionad

factors into account. we must assuss that these data are completely ar-
bitrary. In the absence of dissipative factors. the energy of the distur-
bances is saintalned and there is no energy exchange between types of dis-
turbances in the linear nodal. If it is found that the conbined effect of
dissipative factors extinguishes the energy of any one type of disturbances
considerably more rapidly than the energy of others. it is natural to as-
same that in such a nodal in seat cases this type of disturbances will vir-
tually lever be observed. Then. if the disturbances not filtered out by
dissipation have acne property. this property will be characteristic of

the model in general.

According to [6]. small ataosphsric oscillations on a plane. superposed on
a state of rest. are described by the following linear equations:

atmosphere and the spectrum of oscillations could be divided into gravita-
tional and acoustic parts. In [2), without taking the Coriolis paraneter
into account. the results Here generalized for the case of an arbitrary

tenperature stratification. But to a considerable degree they are qualita-

we will limit ourselves to a study of the characteristic oscillations in

It is of interest to conpare the constructed spectrun of oscillations with
the spectrum of oscillations also of a neutrally stratified, but quasi-
ntatic ataosphere [3]. There are five solutions:

,. M... 31/575747,

1- t 9,; the latter are expressed only in the velocity field. First. we
see that the value 2 - 0, corresponding to geostrophic disturbances, is a
solution in both cases. Second, since

gH Y'—;'— = R7,.

the low-frequency long waves with the frequency (18), being external acous-
tic waves. are also solutions in both cases. however, high-frequency os-
cillations with frequencies (19) and (20), being internal acoustic waves,
were transforaed into internal waves with frequencies A - :1» L and with

a pressure aaplitude equal to 0. For-ally this transition can be traced

as follows. Substituting the functions (8) into equations (1), we supply
the frequency A in the third equation of notion by the factor 8 , that is,

the transition to quasistatics will correspond to the transition 8"0. All
the results will rennin in force. but in place of the first two formulae
(ll) we obtain

a

_ ain’t": $_ ). g‘c-S—‘asu-m
a-W' "——_2u. '

It therefore follows that forauls (16) and the formula (18) which follows
from it rennin unchanged, that is, the external acoustic waves have the
ease frequency as in the full equations. At the ease ties, in the case hot,
1 with 8* 0 kt”. that is, t ere are no such oscillations, whereas in
the case ¢>ﬂ, l with 8» 0 1 ~12; expression (10) in this case shows
that p-eO.

We will apply the results to a study of the problea of a change in the fre-
quency apectrun under the influence of turbulence. He will take into account
vertical turbulent mixing occurring prisarily in the lower atmosphere -

ln the planetary boundary layer, and horisontal turbulent mixing. We will
begin with the first. There are different ways to take into account the
friction of air against the earth. As in [3], we will do this by the

method indicated in [5]. In accordance with this asthod, all the equations
in the nodal rennin the ease as without friction, and are seemed to de-
scribe the processes adequately everywhere. But at the lower boundary of
the ataosphare we stipulate a non-zero vertical velocity, taken fro- the
upper boundary of the Skull boundary layer, which is assuned to be drawn
out into a fill. The nagnituda of this velocity is given by the known
Dyubyuk foraula [S] K
”-T (pss+Pri)'

nnd K I 1.4402 Is. Using expressions (8), we obtain hence in place of the
boundary value condition (2) the following condition for amplitudes:

Thus. our nodel now consists of the systen of equations (1) with the boun-
dary value conditions (2'), (S) and condition (7) for the initial data.
It therefore follows that the solution. as before. is given by fornula
(10). but fron (2') we now obtain. for deternining 1 as a function of k.

real. because in accordance with (ll) this would seen theta. and B . and
therefore. in accordance with (12), the Kroner function at the left and

the function associated with it on the right, are also reel; therefore.

with periodic conditions. This nuns that all the solutions are now atten-
uating. Now we will convince ourselves that the nechanisn of this attenu-

ation is such that long acoustic waves attenuate rapidly in contrast to
quasigeostrophic and sone acoustic waves attenuating slowly.

For our purposes. obviously, it is sufficient to examine how the asylptotic
fornulee (18)-(20) change if equation (13) is replaced by (13'). Omitting
the coeputetiona, we will cite the results.

order to characterize the intensity of attenuation we will take. for ex-

the fict tious part shows that short internal acoustic waves attenuate very
weakly. If. for exa-ple. L - 30 lus. then 1'. > 100 days.

A Mailer problen in a quasistatic case [3] has six solutions: 2- 0. the
values (21) and (18'). and also 2- 1-! . As we now see. a quasistatic ap-
proxiaation. virtually not distorting stationary. quasigeostrophic and
external acoustic waves. filters out the internal acoustic waves. adding
in place of then standing waves with the frequencies 7t - t1. .

Now we will proceed to an analysis of the role of horizontal turbulent nix-
ing in the considered nodal of the atnosphere and we will show that under
its influence. first. the disturbances attenuate with a velocity dependent
little on their type. and second. the long-wave disturbances attenuate for
nore slowly than long acoustic waves under the influence of vertical turbu-
lent nixing. This is a very i-portant circa-stance and showa that under the
Influence of vertical turbulence a quasigeoatrophic and hydrostatic balance
is established at long waves. If it appeared that the little-selective in-
fluence of horizontal turbulence is appreciably stronger than the selective
influence of vertical turbulence. the fact of a sore rapid attenuation of
none types of oscillations in ooaparison with others under the influence of
this latter does not have any iaportance.

ln [6] the assmption was made that allowance for the forces of horizontal
turbulent viscosity. that is. the addition of Laplacians of the correspond-

ing conponents of the velocity vector to the three equations of notion.
leads to the attenuation of free oscillations with a logarithmic decreaent

corresponding functions was added to each of the five equations. Allowance

Now we will note the following. For long waves the difference between
these for-ulna and (ll) and (13) is snall. ‘iherefore, it is possible to
investigate the role of the'psrueters K and v separately. assming their
total contribution to be additive. He will not do this for short waves.
but in this case the problem is easily solved even without such an assum-

tion.

strated that the situation is also the ease in a stably stratified atno-

Abatract: ‘l'he euthore have evaluated the poa-
aibilitiee of different nethoda for auto-atic
control (checking) of data fro. taperuture
aounding of the atnoaphere from neteorological
antellitee. lt ie ahown that on the average not
leaa than 7-8! of the telegraea with data free
indirect sounding contain aerioue errors. For
detecting and eliminating theae arrora it ia
feasible to use etatiatical horizontal and
vertical control methods. aoeewhet Iodified

by taking into account the correlation of ran-
dom errore. As a reault of thie correlation

the eenaitivity of the conaidered lethoda
proves to be quite high. deapite the great dia-
peraiona of the randoe errora.

[Text] For any yeare data free: teeperature aounding of the atmphere fro-
neteorological aatellitea have been diaaeninated on a routine baaia. ﬂow-
uver. atteepte at the use of thie information together with ordinary radio-
:mnde data in constructing initial fielda for nmerical forecasting for the
moat part have led to disappointing rcaulta: foreceeta with the uae of data
fro- indirect aounding have, on the average. been no better than without
:Iuch use. At a result. up to the present time data frol indirect sounding
have not yet been included in the operational linea for the routine pro-
ceaeing of urological intonation at the world prognouic centers. in-
cluding at the USSR Hydro-eteorological Center.

One of the reaaona for such a situation. in all probability. is aa followa.
In the proceaa of collecting. proceaaing and moving any information through
communication channels there will inevitably be individual aerioua errore

must be discarded. This is the objective of methods for automatic control
(checking) with use of an electronic computer. to which, in particular,
radiosonde data are subjected routinely [1. 5]. However. applicable to
data from indirect sounding not only are automatic control methods not em—
ployed. but there has been virtually no discussion of the problem of creat-
ing such methods.

In an early stage in the development of indirect sounding the routinely die-
saminated information on the vertical profiles of temperature and geopoten-
tiel more or less uniformly covered the earth's surface and an appreciable
part of this information was for the region of land covered by data from
ordinary radiosonde observations. however. during recent years there has
been routine transmission of satellite sounding data only over the oceans
and sees. where there were few radiosonde data. Under such conditions the
principal means for checking data from indirect sounding is not their com-
parison with data from direct sounding. but a checking of their internal
consistency.

One of the methods for such checking could be statistical checking (control),
which is used extensively applicable to radiosonde data. It involves, as is
well known (for example. see [b]). a checking of satisfaction of the equa-
tions of statics (barometric formula for relative geopotentiel) in each
layer between two adjacent main isobaric surfaces, and specifically.
cosputation of the nonclosurea p1 of the equation of statics using the
formulas

pl="5+|‘”‘—Aj-Bl (!l+t‘+|)s (I)

where i is the number of the isobaric surface, H is geopotential gp dam, t
is temperature, 'c. A; and B1 are constants:

l _ - I
A,-.- 1342 lg 71': a, “.3 3,4372 lg 71-.- gg g.- (2)

In nddltion to individual serious errors. the ‘51 nonclosurea are caused
by always existing smell random measurement errors and also by the devia-
tion of the vertical temperature profile in the layer fron a linear pro-
file relative to the pressure logarithm. Therefore. the hypothesis of the
presence of serious error arises only when {31 in absolute value exceeds
some admissible nonclosure 151 whose value has been estimated in advance.

Analyzing in such cases the distribution of nonclosurea P1 in adjacent
layers, most commonly it is possible to ascertain the cause and magnitude
of the serious error and introduce the corresponding correction.

Table 1 describes the results of static checking of 912 telegrams with in-
direct sounding deta for 20 July 1976 reaching the USSR ﬂydroneteorolog-
ical Center. [These data were put at our disposal through the kindness

of Ya. H. Kheyfets.] Bach telegram contained data on temperature at 15 sur-
faces from 1000 to 10 mb and on the relative geopotentinl of all surfaces
above 1000 d). 39

Table 1 shows that about 8! of all the telegrans contain serious errors
detected by static checking (static checking (control) is not capable of
detecting all serious errors). This percent is appreciably lower than for
radiosonde data. but it goes without saying that it is impossible to

neglect such a number of errors. we also see that more than 70: of the de-
tected serious errors can be corrected without aabiguity using static con-
trol. and another 10% by means of a simple combination of static control with
none other method.

Unfortunately, beginning in July 1977 the data from indirect sounding. trans-
mitted on a routine basis, do not contain information on temperature. but
only include relative geopotential. This deprives the users of the possibil-
ity of extremely convenient detection and elimination of serious errors in
this information by means of static control.

Another widely used method is horizontal static control. This involves op-
timum interpolation horizontally to the~point to be checked on the basis of
data for surrounding points and comparison of the interpolated and observed
values. In this case the admissible nonclosure is assumed to be proportional
to the mean square error in the mentioned comparison. which is coeputed

in the process of determining the interpolation weights ll, 3].

In evaluating the possibilities of horizontal statistical control of data
from indirect sounding it must be taken into account that the random errors
of these data. first of all. substantially exceed the average errors of

radiosonde data. and second. in contrast to the latter, are horizontally
correlated.

The problem of the magnitude of random error in indirect sounding is now
quite clear: data fron many authors ([7. 11] and others) indicate an agree-
ment with one another that the mean square errors in data from indirect
sounding are approximately twice greater than in the case of direct sound-
ing. For example, for the temperature in the troposphere the estimates are
2-3' in comparison with 1-1.5'0 for radiosonde observations.

It is understandable that this fact reduces the possibilities of horizon-
tal checking of indirect sounding data.

The situation is different with the correlation of satellite sounding errors
horizontally. or to be more precise. along the satellite flight trajectory.
The ideas of different authors with respect to the reason for this correla-
tion and information on the correlation functions of errors are contradic-
tory. At the same time. the fact of the presence of correlation of indirect
sounding data. which was not given due attention over a series of years.

now is generally recognized. This can be judged from a series of studies

by Soviet and foreign authors, such as (7, 9, 10]; the correlation of errors
is traced to distances comparable to the correlation radius of temperature
itself.

Due to the ispossibility of static checking. it is accordingly desirable
to use the statistical asthod for checking indirect sounding data by seans
of vertical interpolation. Applicable to radiosonde data. such a sethod was
proposed by H. l. Yudin [8] (also see [16]).

it in nest desirable to use this approach in checking the values of the rel-
ative geopotential (thickness) of the layers between the adjacent nein iso-
baric surfaces

h. =Hn+| "' "0- up)

The intonation on the statistical relationship between the values of the
relative geopotential h of different layers necessary in carrying out such
checking can be obtained easily on the basis of available data on the inter-
level tespereture correlation. Precisely free the baroaetric female for
relative geopotential (co-pare (l) and (2) we derive the expression

"'3' ' Bo 3- ("WI 4‘ mm“ + "'12.. a + "'32:. MI )' (3-5)
where ”if? = (‘1 - iIW‘a - is)

are the covarietions of relative geopotentiel of "elementary" layers and
the tesperature of the isobaric surfaces respectively and 81 are coeffic-
ients detersined using forsula (2).

As an exasple, in Table 2 we have given the values sh. cosputed using date
fro- V. P. Boltenkov on the interlevel correlation of tespereture for the
winter season ([2]. see also [5]). Since the relative geopotential is pro-
portional to the seen teepereture of the layer. it is characterised by a
greater vertical statistical cohesiveness than the temperature of the iso-

baric surfaces. This can be judged by coapsring the values of the correla-
tion coefficients: “1:.

cited in Table 2 above the coin diagonal with the data published by IIolten-
kov on yfﬁ) [2. 5].

It is desirable. that the vertical control of relative geopotential be ac-
cospl iehed by scans of interpolation using data fros two adjacent layers
- above and belov that being checked, and for the extrese layers - by
scans of extrapolation using data for one adjacent layer. As in the case
of horizontal checking. it is desirable to use an optisun comarison.

As an examle. Table 3 gives the results of cowutetion of the interpolation
weights ‘i-l.i and 'i+l.i and the adsissible nonclosures

of such control on the basis of data on the covariations h from Table 2.
In these coeputationa the dispersions of errors in detersining h; were con-
puted using the formulae

The results of the coaputationa are given for the following variants:

ad that nip - 5(°C) , and for the remaining surfaces ; - 1.500)2 (1 9‘-

In the computations it was "all“! that k - 2.5 (cm-pare [5]).

The data in Table 3 lead to the conclusion that in the absence of correla-
tion between the errors the possibilities of vertical control of data from
satellite aounding on relative geopotential would be far lower than for
radiosonde data. but as a result of the correlation of errors of indirect
sounding the possibilities of vertical checking of both types of informa-
tion approximately coincide and are considerable.

Specifically. the admissible nonclosures of vertical checking of data from
satellite sounding on relative geopotential decrease due to the correlation
of random errors by a factor of more than 2, as can be seen from a compar-
ison of the A 1 values in lines b) and c). An exception is the extreme lay-
ers (in our case 1000/850 and 200/100 mb). the possibilities of whose check-
ing. naturally, are not great. With respect to a comparison of the A1 val-
uee in lines a) and c). it shows that the admissible nonclosures of vertical
checking of data from indirect sounding are even somewhat less than in the
case of direct sounding.

The weights and admissible nonclosures cited in Table 3 can also find di-
rect use in developing a routine method for the checking of data from in-
direct aounding of the atmosphere.

Abstract: It is proposed that the activ-
ity of the hurricane season in an ocean-
ic region be characterized by a complex of
quantitative values: intensity coefficient
K, mean seasonal velocity of movement of
tropical cyclones V. and also their total
internal energy 0. These characteristics
were coaputed for the period 1886-1974 for
the tropical and temperate tones of the
North Atlantic. The mean values and var-

iability of K. V, U agree well with uni-

directional clilstic variations over the
northern hemisphere.

[Text] A great aany studies [1-6. 9-11] have been devoted to all possible

aspects of develop-eat of tropical cyclones (to): frequency of recurrence.
soveaent, cloud and internal structure. energetics and theoretical invest-

igations. However, the activity of individual re and the hurricane season
In general have not been adequately discussed. The qualitative character-

istics "intensive," ”active" [11]. etc. used earlier in different descrip-
tions were aabiguous.

1herefore, our objective was at least a partial discussion of the problem
of activity of the hurricane season. to find quantitative values of this
activity, and also to ascertain the possibility of using infatuation fro-
TC for describing the peculiarities of the tropical zone and the theraody-
namic processes transpiring in it over a long series of years.

it is known that the existence of Tc is associated vitn an entire couple:
of necessary and for the tine being still not thoroughly studied adequate

conditions in the ocean and atmosphere [5. 6]. 0n the basis of regular ob-
uervations for each oceanic region we registered iniorsation, in the form

of the number of Tc. their trajectories and other characteristics. on the
realization of the necessary and adequate conditions for their existence
In the ocean-atmosphere system.

An the meteorologicnl-oeennoarnphir conditions accompanying the formation
of Tc. the authors of [2] used the turbulent transfer of latent heat of con-
densation QC. the turbulent heat flux into the atmosphere from the ocean
surface Qto and also the realization of the latent heat of condensation A.
All these parameters are considered to be the result of interaction between
the ocean and the atmosphere and a Tc is regarded as the result of this
process. Taking into account the conclusion in [2] that the values of the
mentioned parameters before and in the period of formation of TC differ con-
siderably (by an order of magnitude or more) from the "quiet" state of the
atmosphere. it is possible to speak of the existence of Tc as some optimum
in the thermodynamic atate of the ocean-atmosphere system.

The great variability in the number of TC from year to year [1. 3. 6. l0. 11]
makes it possible only in general features to formulate a hypothesis concern-
ing the value to be assigned to this optimum. realized is powerful atmospher-
lc eddies. and on the intensity of such a realization.

The intensity of an individual TC at the present time is evaluated on the
basis of the pressure at its center. maximum wind velocity. duration of per-
uistence of these extremal conditions. and finally. on the basis of the
economic and human losses caused by them. The intensity of the entire hur-
ricane season is judged. for example. on the basis of the total number of

Tc and their number reaching the hurricane stage. However, it is not dif-
ficult to compare these characteristics and they are not exhaustive for
analysis of either an individual Tc or for the entire hurricane season.

The application of a simple method to already existing information on TC
makes it possible to obtain an index of hurricane intensity which can be
used in characterizing individual TC and hurricane seasons in different
nccanic regions. He propose that this index be expressed by the ocean area

ST over which existed a TC determined from the length L of the trajectory
ans the zone affected (diameter D) by the TC:

81c - L9.

This area during the season related to the ocean area so. such as the North
Atlantic. will give the dimensionless coefficient

K - $1c/So.

showing over what part of the ocean region the necessary and adequate condi-
tions were realized during the course of the season.

1he length L of the trajectories for all 16 in the North Atlantic during the
period 1886-1977 in the stages of a tropical storm (TS) and hurricane (Hr)
was determined using the materials contained in [10. ill) and differing

with respect to reliability and systeaetisation in accordance with a
unified method. A joint allowance for the extent of the trajectories
in the storn and hurricane stages was node by us taking into account

that the Qc, QT and A values during the pre-hurricane period corresponded
to their values in a nature hurricane [2].

The choice of the lean disaster of a T0 was conplicated due to the differ-
ent lethod for evaluating its boundaries (on the basis of the diameter of
continuous cloud cover. on the basis of the last closed isobar. on the
basis of the deternined nininun wind speed. on the basis of the diameter
of the rain tone [3. b. 6] etc.). however, theoretical investigations of
Atlantic hurricanes. agreeing with the results of neasureaents in nature.
sets it possible to validate this choice [5. 9].

For an "average tropical cyclone" the radius. equal to 2' of aeridian, is
deternined as the distance to which cyclonic circulation is propagated

[5].

V. V. Shuleykin [9] estimates the radius of a "standard" hurricane at 225
kn. It serves as the outer boundary of a sort of "hurricane nucleus,”

playing a decisive role in all the energetics of the systen. The region
over the overheated ocean surface with such a radius is a real heater of

a heat engine of the fifth kind, the cooler for which is all the space
surrounding the hurricane system [9].

Considering the results of the investigations reported in [5, 9], we de-
cided that the disaster of an "average tropical cyclone" would be equal
to 6' of meridian.

If the area of the North Atlantic 50 is assuned to be bounded by the lati-
tudes 10 and 50's. and in longitude by 20 and mom. 1: measures 3.32-1013
.2 and will reflect the real boundaries of existence of s 10 in this re-
gion. The tropical part of this region iron 10 to 30'N and the tone from
10 to SO'N will be equal to 1.8301013 a and 1.69.1013 n2 respectively.

In the coeputations of these areas we took into account the changes of

non scale with latitude.

As a result we obtained the coefficients of intensity of hurricane sea-
nons K for the North Atlantic as a whole and separately for the zones to
the south and north of 30'" (Table 1).

It follows from Table 1 that in the secular variation K varies in the range
from 0.03 to 0.92. For the tropical part it varies from 0.02 to 1.26, and
In the tcnperate latitudes fro. 0.0 to 0.86. In a single year (1933) of

the 89 years which we considered the area of the ocean over which re ex-
isted exceeded the area of the tropical part (to the south of 30‘N). Dur-
lng this year the intensity coefficient was 1.26 and the number of 1c

was the nsxinun (21) for the entire observation period. Despite this. K

for the te-perate sons (30-50'N) in 1933 (0.53) only somewhat exceeded
the neon long-term value (0.38).

The variability of K (with respect to the standard deviation O'and the rel-
ative variability Va ). considerable in magnitude. is approximately iden-
tical for the tropical and temperate zones of the region and is somewhat
less for the entire North Atlantic.

The great activity of the hurricane seasons in 1887. 1893, 1933. 1953 and
1958. noted in [10, 11), found its reflection also in the quantitative K
values: 0.82, 0.85, 0.92. 0.72 and 0.66 respectively.

A weakening of activity of the hurricane season in 1970 and l972'[11] was
accompanied by a decrease in the number of TC and their intensity coef-
ficients; the latter were more than three times less than their mean long-
term value: 0.11 and 0.12.

The general direct dependence of K on the number of Tc is natural. but it
does not have a regular nature. For example. for a number of TC equal to

7 (and during the considered period there were 8 such years) the intensity
coefficients varied from 0.56 to 0.11. Therefore, it is clear that the cli-
matological characterization of the hurricane season solely on the basis

of the number of Tc incompletely reflects its peculiarities.

The coefficient K, quantitatively describing the intensity of the hurricane
season quite well. is dependent on the total length of the TC trajectories.
However, it only indirectly gives some idea concerning the time during
which the conditions in the ocean and atmosphere optimum for the life of
TC prevail. Determination of this time will undoubtedly refine the charac-
terization of intensity of the hurricane season.

If the length L of the trajectories is related to the time of their existence,
it is possible to obtain the mean velocity of movement of TC during the season
in the storm and hurricane stages for different parts of the region (Table l).
The maximum mean velocity of TC during the season in the tropics was 30.8
kmlhour; the minimum was 12.0 km/hour. Our computations confirm the known

fact of presence of a great velocity of TC in the temperate latitudes (the
maximum of the mean V there is 56.2 km/hour; the minimum is 10 km/hour).

The amplitude of the mean velocity in the temperate latitudes, and also

its variability. during the considered period is approximately twice as

great as in the tropics. The long-term values in the tropical (19.1 km/

hour) and the temperate (30.8 km/hour) latitudes reflect the mean velocities
of the zone of Trades and westerly transfer.

It is obvious that this characteristic in itself is important and can become
a separate theme for investigation.

A deeper understanding of different physical processes arises in an under-
standing of the energy characteristics associated with them. Therefore, we
made an attempt to determine them for the TC for the hurricane season in
the considered region. An individual TC could be characterised most com-
pletely by the energy balance for the entire volume and during the entire

period of its life. and for a season -- by the total indices of the bal-
ance components. Inuvever. such computations involved enormous difficulties
rnuaod'bath by the inadequacy of meteorological information from ocean
areas aad'by the constantly changing parameters of each Tc in the differ-
ent stages of its existence. At the present-day stage calculations of the
energy-balance and its individual components for a real Tc [2. t. S] with

a number of boundary conditions is a difficult problem, but it is soluble.
Such studibs of rc on the basis of data for TC which are 30—60 years old
are still-more difficult due-to the deficiency of meteorological data.
Theoretical investigations of an "average tropical cyclone" and the con-
clusions froa them which agree with the characteristics of real 10 observed
in nature [5. 9] make it possible to determine the mean value of the energy
parameters of a TC for a long series of years. Such an assumption involves
same percentage of error, but on the other hand it gives some idea concerning
the energy level of the TC during the season and its contribution to the
total energy of the northern hemisphere. As a result. it will be possible
to trace the long-term course of this characteristic in relationship to
climatic variations.

The total internal heat source of an "average" TC [5], equal to the outflow
of the energy produced in it. is 56.hs101° kJ/scc or 5.64-1021 erg/sec.

The total power of a "standard" hurricane as a func ion of the gnderlying
surface of the ocean is assumed to be equal to 2'10 UV or 2'10 1 erg/sec
[9]. The close. but lesser than in [5] energy level is probably associated
with its computation for a fixed water temperature (28°C) and air tempera-
ture (27‘c).

In a determination of the "order of magnitude" of the latent heat set free
in a TC. a value 2-601025 erg/day was obtained in [6] or 0.23-0.b6°1021
erg/sec, that is, an order of magnitude less than in [5] and [9]. In [6]
there was no indication of the dimensions of the rc for which the liberated
energy was estimated. ’

Computations for the real typhoon "Nancy" give a total internal energy for
one of the days of 82601025 erg/day [6] or 9.56.1022 erg/sec, that is, this
value exceeds by more than an order of magnitude the levels obtained in

5, 9]. The latter was caused by the radius of the typhoon, greater than 2'
of meridian. Near 20'" (where "Nancy" was situated) the mean radius of the
TC must be 185 miles [3]. Recalculations of the total internal energy of
the typhoon for an area with a radius of 2‘ in meridian gives a value 10.05
-l021 erg/sec. which only exceeds by a factor of 2 the similar energy for
an "average" hurricane according to Palmen and Newton [5].

In our calculations for an "average" hurricane with a radius of 2' in merid-
ian we used a total internal energy equal to 5.65-1021 erg/sec. In the opia-
ion of the authors of [S] themselves. this quantity is somewhat (by 10:) too
low, but rather fully characterizes an "average" to. Multiplying this quan-

tity by the total seasonal lifetime of Tc in the storm and hurricane stages,

we obtained the mean value of the total internal energy of the to (U) dur-
ing each year. The neen end extrelel U are given in Table 1.

troposphere constitutes an irreversible process [5]. it becomes clear how
important it is to examine the problem of Tc as an energy redistribution
mechanism.

If it is sssmaad that the efficiency of a heat engine (which a TC is) is
2.101 [5]. it is possible to determine the kinetic energy generated (Table
1).

Table 1 shows that the levels of the total internal energy of a m are sub-
ject to great variability (Va - 0.60-0.56). The yield of energy from m in
the tropical tone is twice as great as in the zone 30-50’N. The maximum en-
ergy release during a season was observed in 1933 and the minimua was ob-
served in 1916. The total enery yield from TC during the hurricane season
from a square meter of area over which Tc existed on the average was almost
three times greater than the energy which could be assigned to the entire
North Atlantic. The variability of this Tc index has a rather stable nature:
its relative variability for the tone lO-30'N is 0.17: for the temperate
latitudes it is 0.33 and 0.16 for the entire region.

Now we will make some comparisons for estimating energy processes in To.

The mean kinetic energy of the northern hemisphere in susmer is approximate-
ly 19.1-1026 erg [3]. however. the mean kinetic energy of rc for the North
Atlantic for the 09 years which we investigated was 6.21-1026 erg. that is.
a third of this energy. We emphasize that it was generated during 53 days
- the average lifetime of Tc in the Ts and Hr stages. The maximum level
of kinetic energy of Tc (16.14026 erg) was only somewhat less than its
mean value during the northern hemisphere super. The generation of the
kinetic energy of nean meridional circulation in snmer in the northern
hemisphere is astismted at 1-1010 l0! [5] and during the hurricane season
(53 days) is approximately equal to (lull-1026 erg) its generation in Tc
(Table l)e

The heat transport by ocean currents in the northern hemisphere, irected
poleward. attains a maximus at 20'N: 2.1.4022 egg/year or 2.8-102 erg/day
[8]. During the hurricane season it is 145.com erg, that is, approxi-
nately one-half the mean total yield of energy produced in a re (258.6-
1026 erg) and is comparable to the heat of rc released in the troposphere
between 30 and 50’" (85.6-1026 era).

The problem of the methods for atmospheric use of the energy released by
the atmosphere is important and remains inadequately studied. although
Mame aspects of this problem were touched upon in a series of studies
[5.6]. Directly in the zone 30-50‘N the energy of TC is expended on heat-
ing of the troposphere and the transformation of atmospheric circulation.
The energy of Tc in the tropical zone (to the south of 30’") is transport-
vd northward by the mean lladley circulation and participates in maintain-
ing the intensity of the frontal zone and jet streams over the hemisphere

Ne have already examined the presence of a good correspondence of to in-
dices for the North Atlantic and climatic variations on a global scale

in part in [l]. The qualitatively new information on the tropical tone

in this region obtained above on the basis of the characteristics of Tc
for a long series of years also makes it possible to compare them with
climatic variations for the last century. Taking into account the conclu-
sions in [8] that regional climate is part of its general changes and

this In a factor of great importance to be considered. and that the North
Atlantic is a sensitive indicator of these climatic changes. we will com-

pare the diatribution of the parameters which we obtained - the intensity
coefficient K. the lean velocity of Tc V and its total internal energy U
- during different periods of unidirectional climatic variations and in
general we will sttenpt to evaluate its modern trends.

Table 2 gives the mean values and variability of K. V and U during clear-
ly expressed periods of warming (1915-1939) and cooling (l9b0—l966). As a
comparison we have also examined a 25-year period of an insignificant in-
crease in air temperature over the northern hemisphere in the sodern per-
lod (1965-1974).

For the entire water area of the North Atlantic during the period of cool-
ing there are a maximum intensity of the hurricane season, a maximum mean
velocity of movenent of T6 for all the periods and a maximum value of the
released energy. The standard deviation and the relative variability of
these characteristics are not only less than their values for the entire
series, but also less than in the two preceding 25-year periods. This is
evidence of the stability of atmospheric processes forming and determining
the existence of TC in an epoch of global cooling.

warming over the hemisphere was accompanied by K. V, D values close to the
mean long-term values. but appreciably smaller than during a cooling. The
standard deviation was approximately equal to its value for the entire aer-
lea. but greater than during cooling. The relative variability of K and 0
had a maximum value for all the considered periods. In contrast to a cool-
ing, the atmospheric processes determining the existence of TC have an un-
stable character.

The distribution of the considered Tc parameters for the modern period
(1965-1974) and especially during the last five-year period (1970-1976)
for the entire region of the North Atlantic and its parts has tendencies
similar to the warming period (1915-1939). The intensity coefficient for
the entire region during the last decade was equal to K for the warning
epoch. During the last five-year period, in comparison with the period of
cooling. it decreased by approximately 601. The relative variability of
K in the eodern period exceeded its value for the cooling epoch by a fac-
tor of 1.6 and corresponded to the warning period.

A peculiarity of the distribution of the mean velocity of movement of TC
V is an increase in its amplitude between the tropics and the temperate
latitudes during cooling and a decrease during warming. A minimum value

56

of the amplitude was noted during l970-l97‘. The variability for the en-
tire region during different climatic periods does not have clearly express-
ud tendencies. however. for tones to the south and especially to the north
of 30’" it is easy to trace the correspondence of the maximum trend Va- val-
ues to the warming period and the minimum values during the cooling period.

During the modern period ‘7 and Val are closer in value to the warming per-
iods "

A decrease in the total internal energy of Tc. characteristic of the vars-
ing epoch, is clearly traced during the modern period and is accompanied
by a considerable increase in the relative variability of this index.

In checking the hypothesis of a statistical significance of the differences
in the sample means (Table 2) using the Student test [7], on the assumption
that the K. V and U sets almost conform to a normal law. significant differ-
ences were obtained in a comparison of the means for the cooling—warming
epoch. cooling-last 10 years epoch. This is manifested to a high degree
with respect to K and U in the temperate latitudes. The reliability of the

substantial difference in mean values was assigned a confidence coefficient
0.95.

The significance of the difference in sample means was also checked by a
comparison of their difference with the confidence limit expressing the
limits of random variations. The confidence limits of the means (t ) with
an evaluation reliability 0.95 are given in Table 2.

Summary

1. As a result of our investigation of Tc on the basis of data for many years
it was found to be possible to characterise quantitatively the poorly stud-
ied activity of the hurricane season by some new parameters: intensity coef-

ficient K. aean velocity of movement of Tc V and their mean total internal
energy U.

2. Quantitative values of qualitatively new information on the tropical zone

Abstract: An atteapt was sade to explain the
variability of weather conditions in the south-
ern part of the Far East on the basis of dynas-
ics of the Kuroahio Current - the seandering
and eddy for-stion processes. Prognostic rela-
tionahips are obtained. The conclusion is drawn
that there is a need for using satellite infern-
ation data in developing eethods for the long-
range forecasting of hydroneteorologicsl pheno-
sena.

[Text] According to sodern concepts, for successful prediction of weather
it is necessary to take into account circulation in the ocean. processes
of interaction between the ocean and the atsoephere. As is well known. in
the redistribution of heat on the earth an important role is played by sea
currents. They transport enorsous aasses of heat froa one part of the earth
to another. The influence which sea currents exert on the cli-ate and
weather of the continents has been described in many investigations.

During recent years serious changes have occurred in our ideas concerning
the nature of currents in the ocean. 1he old concept of "snooth" large-
ucnle currents has been replaced by ideas suggesting a systel of eddies.

A polygon experilent carried out in 1970 by Soviet scientists in the trop-
lcnl zone of the Atlantic and subsequent investigations [1] indicated that
the principal carriers of kinetic energy in the ocean are eddies uith notion
of water in clockwise (var: anticyclonic) and counterclockwise (cold cyclon-

ic) directions. At each particular assent it is possible to discover an en-
tire series of such eddies in the ocean. different in extent and with dif-

ferent reasons for their appearance.

The study of the physical nature of small- and mesoscale eddy formations
in the ocean and their interaction with the surrounding medium is the ob-
Jectiva of the joint Soviet-American POLIHODB program. The experiments
begun by "Penman-70" are continuing. but even now our investigations
show that the statistical picture of the distribution of eddies in the
ocean (in space and in time) varies. host frequently they are discovered
in the region of the main oceanic currents [1. 9, 10]. here. in addition
to small-scale and mesoscale eddies. there are large-scale eddies formed
from meanders. The diameter of these large dynamic formations varies from
several tens to several hundreds of miles. Harm enticyclonic eddies have
a tendency to move northward; cold cyclonic eddies have a tendency to move
southward. In the atmosphere such eddies are usually displaced in opposite
directions: anticyclonic - to the south. cyclonic - to the north. Giant
eddies — circulations. formed from meanders, determine the oceanic condi-
tions over extensive water areas [2. 10].

In order to clarify the role of meandering processes and large-scale ocean-
ic eddies in formation of weather in adjacent regions we carried out a com-
parison of data on Oceanic circulation conditions in the northwestern part
of the Pacific Ocean with data on the monthly quantity of precipitation

in Primor'ye during the period 1954-1976. Peculiarities of atmospheric pro-
cesses were not taken into account. It was assumed that the quantity of
falling precipitation during the month for the selected territory is an
index of various peculiarities of atmospheric processes. in the develop-
ment of which a significant role is played by thermal conditions in the
considered region of the ocean [3. 6. 8].

As is well known [2, 7. 9]. the northwestern part of the Pacific Ocean, be-
ing a region of interaction between the warm Kuroshio Current and the cold
Oyashio Current. differs from the surrounding waters by intensive heat
transfer processes and eddy formation on fronts. Here it is col-son to ob-
serve cases of the formation of large-scale eddies from the meanders of

the Kuroahio [2, 10. 11]. Several quasiststionary regions of current mean-
dering are traced: a curvature of the current in s southerly direction
(cyclonic meander) most frequently is observed between 137-llo0‘3, lbs-148's
and 152-1598. The curvature of the current in e northerly direction (anti-
cyclonic meander) most frequently is observed between ital-165°! and ins-152'

According to data in [2, 9. 10), the cyclonic eddies formed from the mean-
ders of the Kuroahio have a tendency to be displaced toward the south and
southwest. whereas snticyclonic eddies have a tendency to be displaced to
the north and northeast. with displacement. under the influence of process-
es of horizontal and vertical mixing with the surrounding water, the eddies

are destroyed. The rate of movement of the eddies. in connection with the
specific conditions. varies from 0.5 to 2 miles/day. The lifetime of these
circulations is a half-year to a year. '

Cyclonic eddies exist considerably less tine than anticyclonic for-ations.
Anticyclonic eddies are characterized by the greatest frequency of recurrence.
lntensity and lifetime. meee are formed from meanders of the Kuroshio, whose

for-scion occurs in the region 161-165'8. At the beginning the axis of the

current in this region forms a slightly expressed anticyclonic curvature
to the north. This curvature (meander) gradually increases.

(June-September) on rivers of Amur region. 1) on Ussuri River (Kirovskiy
post). 2) on Bureya River (Kamenka post).

At the base of the meander the distance between the opposite sectors of
the Kuroshio is narrowed; an anticyclonic eddy is formed which is later
detached from the main Kuroshio Current. The lifetime of the meander from
the noaent of its appearance to separation of the warm (anticyclonic) edd-
ies, according to the data in [2], is from one to five years.

The degree of development of meandering processes in the considered region
is different in different years. Thus. according to the investigations of
N. P. Bulgakav [2]. V. P. Pavlychev [9] and V. V. Pokudov [ll], during
the last 20-25 years, according to data which are far from complete (due
to the absence of continuous observations), the development of saticyclonic
meanders (surges of warm waters) in the region lbl-le’E was observed in
1955. 1956. 1959. 1960. 1968. 1971 and 1976. On the other hand, in 1956,
1958. 1966. 1969, 1970. 1972. 1973. 1975-1977 the Kuroshio Current did not
have great curvatures. During these years to the north of it there were
nnticyclonic eddies for-ed fro. meanders. The Kuroshio occupied a lore
southerly position.

period of development and destruction of an anticyclonic meander and the

formation of anticyclnnic eddies is shown in fig. 1. The computations
were made in the Division for Study of hydrological Processes in the
World Ocean in the Far Eastern Scientific Research Hydrometeorological
Institute on the basis of the results of expeditionary investigations.

The dynamic maps were taken from a study by V. P. Pavlychev [9]. Using
these maps. constructed on the basis of observations of the density field,
it is possible to obtain some idea concerning the streamlines and the
velocity of geostrophic currents at any horizon above the zero (reference)

surface. In this case as the reference surface the lower observation hori-
zon - 1.000 m - was taken.

As we see. the data in the figure graphically show different degrees of
neandering of the Kuroshio during different years. In the spring of 1971
the unified Kuroshio flow was observed only to the south of Japan (Fig. l.
at right). To the east of 162'8 the current divided into individual branch-
on, forming meanders. The northern branch of the current attained 60’“ and
at n meridian approximately 165°! turned southward. In the spring of 1972
the Kuroshio did not meander. The summer of 1974 differed from the summer
of 1975 by having a surge of warm waters to the north. In 1975 the Kuro-
shio axis was displaced southward; an anticyclonic eddy was observed to
the north of it. During these years a graphic idea concerning the varia-
bility of the current position is given by dynamic maps, where the Kuro-

ahio flow is clearly traced from the close spacing of the contours (fig.
1. at left).

"hot weather conditions were observed in Primor'ye during the period of
development of anticyclonic meanders in the region 141-165'8 and during
the period of their destruction and the formation of anticyclonic eddies?
Taking into account that for processes of interaction between the ocean
and the atmosphere the considered region is characterized by asynchron-
ous relationships [3-5. 8] and that the formation of eddies here most fre-
quently occurs at the beginning of spring and at the end of winter [10].
for the purpose of obtaining prognostic dependences we used data on the
monthly quantity of precipitation during Hay-August 1956-1976 for 10 sta-
tions in Primor'ye. Precipitation was averaged in area.

Figure 2 shows that during periods of development of anticyclonic meander-
ing in the region 141-145'3 (see the mentioned years) it was most common
to observe an excess of precipitation, whereas during the years of their
destruction and the formation of anticyclonic eddies there was a shortage
of precipitation and drought. The existence of the detected relationships
13 also indicated by data on the long-term variation of summer discharges
(QVI-Ix) of water in the rivers of the Amur basin: Ussuri River (Kirovskiy
post) and the Bureya River (Kamenka post). During the period of development
of a meander the water discharges on the Ussuri River increase by a factor
of 2-3 or more. whereas during the period of destruction they drop off.
The reverse picture is observed on the left-hand tributaries of the Amur:
the greatest water discharges are observed most frequently during the

destruction (absence) of aeanders in the Kuroshio and the foraation of
anticyclonic eddies: the ainiaua discharges are observed during the devel-
opnant of a acander [5].

The physical sense of the deter-ined relationships can be explained in the
following way. During a period of development of large-scale anticyclonic
meanders (surges of warm waters) in the region “1-le1 the high-altitude
frontal zone over the considered region [3] is displaced toward the north.
The extent of the Far Eastern high-altitude ridge decreases from south to
north during the spring-amt period. The zone of convergence of flow
aloft is situated over the Kurile Islands or the Sea of Okhotsk. and there-
fore the frequency of recurrence of anticyclones of the Okhotsk group in-
creases [6]. In the absence of anticyclonic meanders the frontal zone in
the atmosphere over the considered region occupies a sore southerly posi-
tion. In this case the greatest frequency of recurrence of anticyclones

is not observed over the Sea of 0khotsk, but over the northwestern part of
the Pacific Ocean.

“the role of Okhotsk anticyclones in the formation of sums: weather over
the Far East is well known [6]. With their intensive develop-ant, in Pri-
nor'ye there is a predominance of moist weather; with weak development
there is a predoainance of relatively dry weather. In the first case

the westerly and southwesterly cyclones, encountering a pressure barrier,
become stationary over Priaor'ye or regions close to it; in the second
case they pass along the bur basin and lore southward of Pri-or'ye and
this causes the noted peculiarities in variation in the quantity of pre-
cipitation.

The determined relationships indicate that the peculiarities of dewlopaent
of atmospheric processes over the northwestern part of the Pacific Ocean
and the regions adjacent to it are influenced to a considerable degree not
only by the "ocean-continent" temerature gradients [12]. but also by the
temperature contrasts between war- and cold water assess and the localiza-
tion of this zone of contrasts in space. The sign of the teeperature anon-
:nly of surface waters during the period of develop-ant (destruction) of a
meander and the formation (destruction) of the anticyclonic eddies can be
very different. An analysis of the ups of distribution of water tewera-
ture anoaalies at the ocean surface in the considered region during the
uu-er period 1966-1976 indicated that 1969 and 1971 were extrenly cold.
In the first case to the east of the Japanese islands there were anticy-
clonic eddies‘and the Kuroshio QIrrent occupied a southerly position. In
the second case, an anticyclonic meander was observed in the considered
region. The subtropical waters, as was noted above (Fig. l. at right)

were propagated to 50'“. The su-er of 1968 was extresely were. The season
was characterized by the develop-ent of an anticyclonic stander. by the
propagation of war- waters to 60'“ and northward.

“the noncorrespondence between the actual tawerature field of the ocean
and the distribution of water teaperature anomalies is evidently attrib-
utable to the fact that the norm available to the researcher in fact

are not entirely indicative for evaluating the thermal state of the water

masses in this season (month). This problem requires additional investi-
:mtiona.

Our investigations indicate that data on the dynamics of the Kuroshio Cur-
rent in the region 151-145'8 (meandering and eddy formation) give import-
ant information for evaluating weather conditions in the future. This re-
quires regular expeditionary observations of the Kuroshio regime.

Recently there has been rapid development of methods for satellite oceano-
graphy. Photographs taken from satellites make it possible to see the boun-
daries'of currents (temperature contrasts). cyclonic and anticyclonic mean-
ders and eddies. This means that data froa satellites and the determined
relationships even now can be used in developing methods for and preparing
long-range forecasts of hydrometeorological phenomena.

Abstract: The authors have foraulated the prob-
lem of nuaerical analysis of the ozone field
on the basis of the totality of data fro-
ground and satellite observations. The ar-
ticle proposes an algorithm for the recursive
assimilation of intonation supplying optimua
statistical evaluations at the points of inter-
section in a regular grid. Also examined are
spatial interpolation schemes. as well as
schemes for the smoothing and assimilation

of different types of ozone data. A study is
made of the spatial structure of evaluation
errors. The effectiveness of assimilation of
the temperature and ozone fields in the strato-
sphere on the basis of a combined observation
system is demonstrated. The characteristics

of accuracy in estimating ozone "hen using
different analytical schemes are presented.

[Text] There are two approaches for attaining a satisfactory accuracy in
determining the ozone field. The first involves an increased complica-
tion of a satellite experiment program (carrying out cobined measurements
of the lid), transparency and at the nadir [2]). In this paper we discuss
the possibilities afforded by another approach. A refinement of estimates
of the three-dimensional ozone field at the points of grid intersection
can be accomplished on the basis of realization of recursive procedures of
optimum spatial smoothing and assimilation of data froa satellite and ground
measurements and also the use of additional information from observations
of the temperature field. In this case use is obviously made of factual in-
formation on the statistical structure of the considered rando- fields.

Modeling of Ozone Gaservation System
On the basis of the results of neasureasnts from surface ozone sounding sta-
tions [9]. which we regard as the points of intersection in a horizontal

grid. we coaputed the first and second aoaents of the randoa three-dimension-
al ozone field. In this case it is necessary to have intonation not only on

the total content. but also on the vertical ozone profile. 'lherefore. there
was a possibility of using data for only two groups of stations (India -
0 stations, Europe - 5 stations). we used samples consisting of 60 realis-
ntions (records) (for each of the considered stations) and relating to the
spring period of 1969-1972 [9].

The structure of the vectors to be evaluated X is characterised by the disen-
sionality n - 10. The first coeponent is the total content «1(n ate-ca). the
nine following coaponents correspond to the vertical distribution q (nb) at
a particular observation point.

Now we will discuss setth for stipulating the specific fore of the opera-
tors ‘i' In the case of ground measure-ants the role of the indicated opera-
tor is played by the unit utrix I. We will assure that satellite reassure-
Iasnts are Ilsde at the nadir using a three-channel IR spectre-eter (ozone ab-
sorption band 9.6}ua. centers of intervals: was, 1055. 1065 “-1. spectral

in accordance with the_schene presented in [2]. on the basis of the corres-
ponding seen profiles q. The random observation errors s were modeled, pro-
ceeding on the assumption that the levels of errors in ground observations
are S~lO‘3 CI for (J, 3 nb for q, and the errors in satellite spectrometer
measure-ants are l erg/(cmzasec-srwu‘l).

In the course of an analysis of the coeputation results we discovered a
sieilarity of two statistical characteristics: the correlation coefficient
between 0 and q. and also the relative residual dispersion for the remote
sounding eethod. It can therefore be concluded that data from satellite
nadir aeasuresents for the lost part contain intonation on the total ozone
content. A more precise detersination of the vertical distribution of q

is accomplished by scans of a and regression.

Figure 1 shows the sasothed dependence of the horizontal correlation function
of the total ozone content obtained on the basis of processing of data for
46 stations in the northern heeisphere [9].

Martial ﬂodels for Spatial Analysis

Information on the spatial statistical structure of the ozone field make it
possible to use more coeplex analytical models for the interpolation, smooth-
ing and assieilstion of elements not only for the vertical, but also for the
horizontal comonents. The results of these computations are presented in
Table l in a uniform fora. The table gives the absolute and relative errors
and also the RBI) of the a and q estiastes. The characteristics relating to

«I were averaged for h.

First we will discuss optinula interpolation, the need for which arises

when there is e noncoincidence of the points of intersection in the regular
grid and the observation points. He will discuss the accuracy in determining
ozone on the basis of the remte nethod directly at the observation point
(analytical scheme c). In this case the error in evaluating a) is equal to

74

(5-10)°10'3 cs, which is a relative error of 2-32. The RRD of the evalua-
tions are 5-152. For the q profile the similar characteristics fall in

the range 5-20 nb. or 10-251, and the RR!) of the evaluations are 60-80%.
Thus, the relative errors in determining the q profile exceed by an order
of magnitude the errors in evaluations of the total content. The simplest
interpolation method is extrapolation from the observation point to the
closest point of intersection in the grid (scheme 3). The data for var-
iants 3 - l, 2. 3 make it possible to note the low accuracy in estimates of
the total content. even when using data from ground measurements. The de-
termination errors increase less appreciably. Howevar. the mm of the esti-
mates exceed the 801 level. In the case of extrapolation of data from sat-
ellite'msasureme'nts the errors in the estimates are still greater (3- lo).
'l'he RED values for q are 85-90:. Comparison of the 9 variants l, 2 makes
it possible to note a dependence of the extrapolation error on distance.

Optimum interpolation (scheme u) ensures a significant increase in anal-
ytical accuracy (Fig. 2a,b). With an increase in the nmber of points at
which ground observations were made (u - 1-5), it is possible to increase
the analytical accuracy by a factor of 1.5-2. The absolute values of the
errors for the European region are somewhat greater than for the Indian
region. Nevertheless, the RR!) values are approximately identical for both
regions. The data for variants u - 6, 7 indicate a smoothing of the errors
in satellite observations when using an optimum interpolation algorithm.
In this case the errors in determining a, are equal to (lO—lS)le‘3 cm,
which is 3-51. The errors in evaluating the q profile are 5-10 nb, or 10-
251 respectively. A comparison of variants c - 5, u - 6,7 indicates that
the interpolation procedure more effectively refines the :1 profile than

45 . A comparison of data for u - 2. 3, 6, 7 leads to the conclusion that
the accuracy of analysis on the basis of the results of satellite measure-
ments is 1.5-2 times lower than according to ground observations. He note
that the vertical structure of analytical errors varies little with an in-
crease in the amber of ground observation points (Fig. 2a) and is smoothed
with an increase in the number of satellite measurements (Fig. 2b).

In a case when the system of satellite observations is sufficiently ”dense"
in horizontal coordinates (relative to a regular grid) an important role
must he played by the procedures of spatial smoothing and assimilation.

The spatial smoothing of satellite information (scheme cc) ensures an in-
crease in evaluation accuracy (c - 3, cc - l) of U and <1 by 25-302. The
Rub values in this case are reduced by a factor of 1.5. The limited ef-
fectiveness of smoothing of errors is evidently attributable to the rela-
tively greater distances between observation points. The vertical structure
of errors in this case (Fig. 2c) remains extremely inhomgeneous. For re-
gions having a network of ozone sounding stations the procedures of assim-
ilation of data from satellite and ground measurements (scheme cyc) are of
practical importance. An examination of the variants c - 3, cyc - 1,2 indi-
cates that the use of information free ground stations situated at a dis-
tance of 1,000 km makes it possible to increase the accuracy of sounding

75

from a satellite by a factor of approximately 1.5-2. The vertical struc-
ture of analytical errors is considerably smoothed (Fig. 2d). Somewhat
poorer results were obtained for the European region (cyc - 3. lo).

11w cited research results indicate that information on the statistical
structure of the three-dimensional ozone field creates a basis for the
effective use of objective analysis procedures for the purpose of reducing
observation errors. increasing the value of data from remote sensing. and
also for representing the collected intonation at the points of intersec-
tion of a regular grid.

Assimilation of Ozone and Temperature Fields

The low accuracy in determining ozone from satellite measurements dictates
the use of additional information. Data from ground observations supply
data for only an insignificant part of the earth's surface. On the other
hand, already over a period of years a satellite system has been in develop-
neat for thermal sounding of the atmosphere. Researchers [11) also note
the presence of a significant statistical correlation between the diatrib-
ution of ozone and temperature in the stratosphere. Guided by these pre-
requisites, we carried out modeling of a combined system of satellite and
ground observations of ozone and temperature simultaneously. In this case
the components of the vector of parameters to be evaluated were obtained
from data on the total content 0’, concentration q and temperature 1'. Only
two stations in Europe -- Berlin and Hohenpeisenberg - had synchronous
aerological data of this type.

in the computations we used samples consisting of 60 ozone profiles and 60
temperature profiles for each of the mentioned stations for the spring per-
iod 1970-1971 [9]. In an analysis of the system for remote temperature
sounding of the stratosphere we used the matrix operator A1, corresponding
to the "weight functions" of the lo-channel SCR satellite IR spectrometer
[10]. In the computations it was assumed that the error in spectrometric
measurements made for thermal sounding purposes is l erg/ (cmzosec-srmm'l);
the error in aerological sounding is 1'c. The errors in measuring ozone
were the same as above.

How we will examine briefly the principal correlation characteristics of
the ozone and temperature fields. 1'. can be seen from the data in Fig. 3
that the spatial correlations of the tenerature field are the strongest.
The cross-correlation of teaperature and ozone on the average is 40-501

and is close in structure and value to the spatial correlation for ozone.
but is considerably poorer than the temperature correlations.

Several typical situations can arise in the assimilation of ozone and ten-
verature information. He will examine them. The results of numerical model-
ing are presented in Table 2. The simplest case is when we have information
on temperature (schema T) at a point of intersection in the horizontal
grid. It is found that the presence of satellite (1' - l) or aerological

76

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

(1‘ - 2) information on the thermal structure of the stratosphere ensures
obtaining not less precise (on the average) osone estimates than on the

basis of remote ozone sounding (c - l). A comparison of curves 2 in Pig.
loa,b'with the graphs in Fig. 2c makes it possible to note that the struc-
ture of the information obtained on q from the results of temperature
sounding differs considerably from that which is characteristic for the
ozone remote sensing method. This circmaatsnce serves as an additional
basis for the assimilation of both types of measurements.

Now we will examine a case when as the initial information for obtaining
an ozone estimate at a grid point of intersection it is possible to use
data from asrological sounding of temperature obtained at adjacent meteor-
ological stations (scheme not). A comparison of the variants 'r - 2. eat -
1 leads to the conclusion that with a noncoincidence of the temperature
observation point with a grid point of intersection the accuracy in es-
timating ozone decreases considerably. The use of two independent temper-
ature measurements (ua'l' - 2) and use of ozone measurements (ua'i' - 3) makes
possible a considerable increase in the accuracy of estimating ”and q.

In this case the errors are 15-10‘3 cm and 10 ab respectively. The vertical
structure of analytical errors is quite homgeneous (Fig. is).

Now we will discuss the possibilities of use of data from remote temperature .
sounding for estimating dand q (scheme uc'r). A conparison of the variants
uaT-2. uc‘r — 1 indicates that the replacement of aerologicsl temperature
data by satellite data leads to an insignificant loss in the accuracy of

the estimates made. me addition of satellite intonation on temperature

and ozone at an adjacent observation point (uc‘i‘ - 2) leads to an increase

in the accuracy of (J estimates by 202 and q by 10:. The inclusion of data
from surface measurements of ozone in combination with satellite information
on temperature (uc'l' - 3) has a more appreciable effect. The homogeneity of
the vertical structure of errors in this case is illustrated in Pig. lob. Thus,
in the interpolation of temperature data the accuracy in estimating ozone

ls (15-30)-10'3 cm for «land 10-20 nb for q.

Now we will examine an analytical scheme based on the spatial assimilation
of satellite data on ozone and temperature (scheme cc‘r). In actuality, our

rmqmrlmm of the variants cc'i‘ - l, 2 and c - 1,2 leads to the conclusion
that the use of data from remote temperature sounding makes it possible to
increase the accuracy in estimating ozone by 20-50%. The corresponding RED
values are reduced by a factor of 1.5-2. however. in this case the vertical
nonuniformity of satellite ozone information (fig. 4c) begins to have an
effect to a greater degree than in the situations considered earlier.

ﬂow we wlll discuss an assimilation scheme with the "st of data from aero-
logical measurements of tawerature (scheme ca'f). 0n the basis of a com-
parison of ca‘l' - l, 2 and c - l, 2 we conclude that the use of data from
surface temperature observations in a numerical analysis ensures an in-
crease in the accuracy of estimating a! by 20-60: and q by 30-50:. In

77

this case the MD decrease by a factor of approximately 2, attaining values
10-302. It should be noted that in mltipoint assiailstion the replace-ant
of scrological infatuation on tesperature by satellite infomtion does
not lead to a significant loss in accuracy in estilating ozone (cc‘l‘ - 1, 2,
ca‘l‘ - l. 2). There is sole smoothing of the vertical structure of errors
(Pig. lad) in comparison with the cc‘l' scheme.

Thus. temperature data are an luportsnt predictor of the actual ozone distrib-
ution in the stratosphere. The use of teaperature intonation (remote or aer-
ological) lakes it possible to increase the accuracy in nuserical analysis

of the ozone field by a factor of 1.5-2.

Abstract: On the basis of aicrocliaetic inves-
tigations in built-up areas. in streets, at in-
tersections, in open areas and squares and using
aircraft sounding of the underlying surface and
conputetiona it has been established that one of
the principal factors favoring an increase in air
tesperature on clear days in aux-er by 8°C and in
winter by 10°c in Alas-Ate city in cowerison with
its outskirts is the fact that the area is built
up. Urban nicroclinete can be regulated to a con-
siderable degree by the rational distribution of
green areas, fountains and water surfaces, in con-
bination with the built-up area.

[Text] As a result of the intensive growth of population and the sire of
cities the changes occurring in their cliaate are becoaing nore inpreasive
and appreciable. Large cities, regardless of their latitude and landscape-
cliastic tones, with respect to their aacroclinatic conditions are heat
islands [9, lb, 16, l7, l9]; esidet the saall cities of the steppe, seni-
desert and desert zones there are also oasis cities [5]. However, the pres-
ence of one heat island over a city is more clearly expressed in cities

in plains areas, provided that at the ease tine they are characterized by

.1 mifornity of built-up areas, a uniformity of green areas, etc.

The aicrocliaete of Alas-Ate is formed under particularly comlex orograph-
ic conditions [2]. The steppe begins along the northern margin of the city
and this steppe undergoes transition into desert; its southern nrgins

cone right up to the northern slope of the Zailiyskiy Alatau. 0n the south,
southeast and east the city is frased by hills which rise 600-700 In above
the city. In addition, the relief of the city, although uniformly, drops
off from south to north with a change in elevation by 200-250 a. Such a

coubinntion of relief and the city create a complex structure of inter-
action of the factors forming nicroclinate.

The urban built-up area is one of the factors introducing substantial
changes in alnost nil tho nicroclinatic characteristics of this particular
city.

In order to make a quantitative estimate of the degree of influence of
the factors favoring both an increase and decrease in temperature in the

city we carried out computations of the radiation tesperatures of well
surfaces. measure-ants of the temperature of the underlying surface of a
city from a sounding aircraft and experimental investigations at fountains.
walls of buildings. in squares and streets. at intersections. in green
areas and in open spaces in a city. These essentially involved measure-ant
of temperature and air humidity. determination of wind direction and velo-
city at a height of 1.5 m using HV-b aspiration psychroneters and HS-la
anemoeeters.

Computations of the radiation temperature of the wall surface (t uiv) were
carried out using actual regime data for scheduled observation tIges at the
Alma-Ate Hydrometeorological Observatory. The computation formulas used
were the formulas derived by A. M. Shklover [13]. taking into account that
for the conditions prevailing in Alma-Ate according to the SNiP (Construc-
tion Nor-n and Specifications) P-A-7-62 the heat transfer coefficient at
the surface of a barrier is Bobs - 20 Clem2'°C)and the coefficient of ab-
sorption of solar radiation by the outer surface of a barrier is P I 0.6.

with the exposure of a barrier construction to solar radiation the surface
tenperature of the wt Is subjected to the insolation during the daytime
during the course of the entire year increases by 13-17'0 and the tempera-
ture of the shaded walls increases up to 6°C as a result of secondary scat-
tering in comparison with the surrounding air (Table 1). K. A. Birskaya and
Z. L. ltnatetidze [l], on the basis of field observations and computations
for the Tbilisi urban area.drew the conclusion that for surfaces with dif-
ferent orientations the solar irradiation is equivalent to a considerable
temperature increase: for the eastern and western walls by 22.5'6, for the
southeastern and southwestern walls - by 20.2'c. for the northern walls

- by 6.2'c, for asuthern walls -- by 15.6'c. with a maximum (by 27.4'c)
for the horizontal surface.

Heating of the well surfaces and the underlying surface naturally also in-

creases the temperature of the surrounding air. This is confirmed by mater-
ials from flight experimental observations made in July and August 1973 and
averaged for 3-5 days during periods of clear and semiclear weather. These

same tables give data for equivalent and equivalent-effective temperatures

computed using the P. A. Kondrat'yev formulae [7].

The southern wall of a four-story building situated in a group of houses
heats the adjacent air layers. As a result, at a distance of 1.5 m the air
temperature on the average is 1.7'c higher in comparison with the tempera-
ture at a distance of 1.5 m from the northern wall of a building standing
parallel to it. From the moment of incidence of the rays on the north side
(about 1530 hours) the air at the wall begins to heat rapidly and after
I.0-l.5 hour the temperature is evened out. The influence of the southern
wall is also clearly traced at a distance of 20 m.

The wind velocity in the gap between the long sides of the buildings in
the considered case attains maximu- values in the middle of the passageway
and minimum values at the south wall. The considerable weakening of wind

velociyy_at the south wall must be attributed to an increase in turbulent
exchange.

Asphalted surfaces also favor an increase in air temperature. The air tem-
perature maximua in Lenin Square (the central part of Alma-Ate) was greater
by 2.3'c at 1430 hours than in an adjacent public garden and the relative
humidity was lower by 162 (Table 2).

The temperature differential between the square and the public garden favors
the development of convective exchange and an increase in wind velocity over
the square by 701 in comparison with the wind velocity at the Alma-Ate

Hydrometeorological Observatory and in comparison with the public garden
by a factor of four.

0n the basis of similar investigations carried out at Samarkand, Vblgograd.
Ashkhabad. Tashkent, Baku and abroad, it was established that during anti-
cyclonic weather in parks and wooded areas the air temperature can be re-
duced by 8°C, wind velocity by 801, and relative humidity is increased by
10-20! [3, 6. 8. 10, 18). Tress. especially broadleaf trees, forming a
continuous wall. are good absorbers of noise, reliably protect living
quarters against dust and improve air exchange in the city [15].

Green plantings improve the microclimate of an urban area, create good con-
ditions for rest in the open air. and safeguard the soil and walls of build-
ings against excessive heating. The distribution of temperature and air
humidity in a city can, to a considerable degree, be regulated by rational dis-
tribution of green areas.

Taking into account the high effectiveness of green plantings, Z. N. Chabo-
tareva [ll] reconnends for the conditions of Central Asia a normalization

not of the area free from built-up sectors and pavements, but the mass of
green with intensive irrigation. A similar opinion was given by Yu. L. Rauner
and H. H. Chernavskaye [9] on the basis of the radiation and heat balances

of the city. They note that in order to ensure the maximum possible micro-
climatic effect, in the southern regions of the USSR about 70-802 of the
built-up area should be occupied by plantings. In the middle zone this ef-
fect is attained with the greening of 50-601 of the built-up area.

In the opinion of many hygienists. the total area of green plantings in a
city should occupy approximately half of the entire area [12]. As a result
of different peculiarities of cities - relief, climate and distribution
of industrial enterprises -- the distribution of green plantings in the
area must be different.

the great dryness of the air and inadequate soil moistening. especially

tions in the city. In our opinion, the most pronising neana for supplying
water to cities is fountains.

As is well known, fountains are surfaces of active evaporation, and accord-
ingly, heat absorption. Therefore, experimental investigations were carried
out at fountains of all types in the city of Ala-Ate. It was established

that the fountains reduce the temperature of the adjacent air layer by 1.0-
1.0’0 and increase the relative huidity by 10-20:. with respect to micro-

clinnte. the nost effective leans was found to be lawn aprayera and these

As mentioned above, on sunny summer days asphalt and concrete pavements

are greatly heated and this favors heating of the soil with depth; in
addition, an increase in the heating of the underlying surface and the

soil in the city is also favored by a considerable increase in wind velo-
city. And this. in combination with the above-aentioned factors, favors the
formation of an increased temperature background in the city.

For example, observations of soil temperature in the cities Novyy Usen'
(1969-1970) and Balkhash (1971-1972) indicated that in the summer months
in the upper 50-cm layer there is an increase by 3.0-5.0'c in comparison
with sectors outside the city. As is well known, during winter the radia-
tion heating of the underlying surface is considerably weaker as a result
of a decrease in the influx of solar radiation and a more intensive thaw-
ing of the snow in the city. but in general a substantial increase in the
temperature of the underlying surface persists, which is also favored by
the internal heat release of an industrial and communal nature.

The circumstances outlined above indicate. first of all, a complex nature
of formation of urban microclimate. second, that local circulations caused
by temperature contrasts, seem to be a result of a combining of all the
factors enumerated above.

The synchronous instrumental measurement of air and soil temperature with-
in a large city requires enormous efforts. Therefore, we attempted to ob-
tain some idea concerning the field of distribution of temperature con-
trasts in the city by means of measurements of the radiation temperature
of the underlying surface. 35

Figure 1 shows caps of the radiation temperatrze field (temperature, tak-

that is. for the early evening (1600-1800 hours) and morning (0700-0900
hours) periods on 12-13 December 1975.

In the city in the early evening there are three clearly expressed heat
foci. These agree well with areas which are built up with buildings with
four or mare stories with a great density (Fig. la). The most intense of
these foci is situated at the center of the city, with a maxinum increase
in the radiation temperature of the underlying surface up to +0.2'c in
the neighborhood of the thermoelectric power station. A second focus with
a temperature of -lo'c occupies the industrial area of the city. In the
western part of the city (microrsgions) there is the weakest heat focus
with a temperature of -6'c, whereas beyond the limits of the city there
are sectors with a radiation temperature of -lO'C. Along the floodplains
of the Malaya and Bol'shaya Almatinka within the city area there is a
decrease in the radiation temperature of the underlying surface caused
by the runoff of cold air from the mountains. this is manifested partic-
ularly clearly in the vicinity of the Bol'shaya Almatinka River. In the
northwestern and southwestern parts of the city there are sectors with a
stagnating air mass and its cooling.

In the morning the nature of the field of radiation temperatures of the
underlying surface of the city somewhat changes. It is possible to trace
a temersture decrease over the entire area of the city, but its con-
trasts with s maxim. differential to 10°C at the center in comparison
with its margins persist (Fig. lb).

In conclusion. for improving the microclimate of the city it is possible
to recon-send the following:

1. For Alma-Ate it is desirable to weaken the ”heat islands" by means of
creating green zones (parks, public gardens. boulevards) of a meridional
direction through the entire city; there must be a further increase in
the greening of the built-up urban area. Its distribution should corres-
pond rigorously to the conditions for protecting the city against con-
taminations, noise and other unfavorable agents.

2. Aircraft soundings with the use of radiometers or heat sensors constit-
ute the optimum method for the regionalization of cities with respect
to their temerature regiee.

Abstract: The authors propose a precise solu-
tion of the nonstetionary problee of struc-
ture of the main thermocline. This makes it
possible to trace the evolution of disturb-
ances in the temperature field caused by the
interaction of currents and the distribution
of density in the ocean. At the sane time it
is possible to obtain a sore realistic de-
scription of the vertical structure of the
temperature field in the ocean than is pos-
sible when using "single-parameter" models
and to give a quantitatiu description of
the velocity and direction of displacements
of characteristic points on the temperature
profile (inflection point and point of maxi-
mum curvature).

[Text] At the present time a great number of studies have been published
on the theory of the main oceanic thersocline, based on geostrophic rela-
tionships and the equations of turbulent "diffusion" of density, includ-
(ng all the convective te‘ 1s (see reviews [6, 7, 16. 17]). Despite the
fact that n total solutio of this problem, with the influence of shores
and bottom relief of the ocean taken into accomt. has not been obtained
even for the simplest boundary conditions. it has been possible to explain
theoretically a number of peculiarities of the vertical structure of the
ocean and the thermohaiine circulation associated with it.

The successes attained are associated to a considerable degree with the use
of stipulated models of the distribution of the density anomaly 5 (relative-
ly constant value at the bottom) along the vertical. For computing the den-
uity profile in these models it is necessary to know only one paraseter,
which is found from solution of the problea; therefore they are called single-
parameter models.

At the same time. in the internal regions of urge-scale subtropical cir-
culations. occupying extensive areas of the world ocean. there is a lore
complex structure of the density field. From the surface to depths of sev-
eral hundred meters the density is virtually constant and only below this
begins to increase sharply (vertical profile 5 with an inflection point).
Single-parameter models are inconvenient for describing such types of ver-

tical density distribution and this greatly narrows the sphere of their
application.

In order to eliminate the mentioned shortcoaing of single-parueter sodels,
in [8. l5] a homogeneous layer is "spread” over the theraocline. llowever.
for closing the problem with such an approach it is isponsible to get by

without additional assmsptions. for example. the requireaent that Vertical
velocity at the discontinuity of two layers be equal to zero [8].

The purpose of ‘his study is fomlation of s two-parameter model, which
will make it possible to describe more complex density distributions than
:in exponential or any other single-parameter Iodel. In particular. a two-
parameter model can represent different 5 profiles having an inflection

point or some other characteristic points and the deformations of such pro-
files with time can be traced (reference is to long-period changes with a
characteristic tine scale of about several months). In addition, it is of
theoretical and practical interest to investigate the transport and defor-

mation of a density (tasperature) disturbance at the free surface of the
nccnn. stipulated at some initial moment in time.

The proposed mdel is simple and the most natural generalization of an ex-
ponential 5 distribution. At the same time. the fundamental equations of
the dynamics of a baroclinic ocean can be here completely satisfactory
under some additional conditions which will be mentioned below.

1. Formulation of Problem

He will examine a nonstationsry circulation in a baroclinic ocean outside
the boundary layers. The ocean is situated on a Ib-plane, has a finite
depth and is bounded only by an eastern shore. which is arbitrarily modeled
by a vertical wall extending along a meridian. The dynamics of circulation
is governed by the vertical Ekman velocity we and the density anomaly 8 d
stipulated at the lower boundary of the friction layer. Going on the basis
of estimates of the orders of magnitude in the fundamental equations of

hydrothermodynemics for a baroclinic ocean [1. 5], we tslte the initial sys-
tee of equations in the form

face is selected as the origin for reading of the vertical coordinate (x -

2. Solution Method

We will use a representation of the baroclinic component of the potential
function in the form [7]

Mix, y. :. !)=|m(x. y. 0+1: (x. y. l) -:| rum-0'. (2.1)

where n. n. k are unknown functions. which Iaust be found. Since one of these

is expressed using the boundary condition through the other two. there are
two independent parameters in (2.1) and the sodel can be called a two-para-
Iaeter nodel.

it is easy to confirs. using expressions (1.17), that with n - 0 the function
R4 corresponds to the concept "depth of the baroclinic layer of the sea."
defined as the level at which the density anonsly is attenuated by a factor
of e relativa to its value at the surface and n is the strea- function of
baroclinic total flows, sultiplied by the Coriolis para-star f.

in any density sodels there lust be satisfaction of the physical require-
ments of attenuation of the density anomaly with depth and stability of
stratification of waters. which for our two-parenter sodel have the fora:

are considered. also the require-ent of the existence of an inflection

or MlV(x' y, 0. () nk’(mh—4ll)>0. (2'3"
where ‘n is the depth of the inflection point.

After ole-entary transforlstions of the system of inequalities (2.2). (2.3a)
we obtain

mk< (3—kz)n;

Conditions (2.6) ispose sone restrictions on choice of the functions I, n, k.
They must be satisfied, at least. within the linits of the baroclinic layer,

since in the abyssal layer the density anoealy 6 becones negligible and the
restrictions on I, n, It lose sense.

The evolution of the disturbance is shown in Fig. lb.c.d. It can be seen
that the initial spot of war- water is displaced to the west, or more
precisely. taking into account the dependence of Cf on latitude, to the
west-northwest. This sane factor causes a characteristic deformation of
the spot (Fig. lb,c). It is drawn out into a narrow zone with a bend

tion of the for. of this disturbance are shown in Figures 1-6 in [16]. The
principal difference is the absence of displecenent of the eastern part of
the spot to the south according to our conputations. however, it can be
hoped that allowance for influence of the wind, which creates a meridional
circulation. will nuke it possible to reproduce in the nodal also this

that disturbances of the stationary density field with a tine scale of

In particular, in the Soviet polygon in the Tropical Atlantic [12] the cli-
matic type of teuperature (density) distribution of water Tu (vertically)

The expression h - 2f/h (B - ln q). as can be seen easily, with admissible

For an snticyclonic disturbance (the warmer water is situated in the middle)

it is of definite interest to compute evolutiOn of an initial field of the
type (3.11) with a periodic function ENS) (5 - 0.2, W“); l. ‘9’(£)

- sin(lm£)). In essence, the adoption of such an initial condition at the
parallel is equivalent to stipulation on the meridian of a source of har-
monic disturbances similar to that used in [3, lo]. It is therefore not un-
expected that the patterns of evolution of the initial field shown here
(Fig. 2a,b,c) coincide with the similar patterns in [3, la]. Additional a1-
lowance for the influence of nonlinearity in our model leads to an overturn-
ing of the disturbance in the south after 1-2 years and in the north after
3-12 years, which coincides with the estimate of the time t8 of onset of
the first overturning of the harmonic wave in the middle latitudes when us-
lng a single-parameter model [9] (t a 3-6 years). The results of comput-
ations for 5J4 years are presented in Fig. 2d. The upper half of the region
is occupied by regular waves and the lower half by waves breaking down as

:1 result of the nonlinear effect.

The qualitative similarity in the peculiarities of evolution of the initial
density (temperature) disturbance in the ocean to field data. and also the
correspondence of the velocity of movement of characteristic points on the
vertical density profile to the conditions of the hydrophysical polygon

in the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean, indicate the possibilitiec of
the proposed two-parameter model. The principal mechanism considered here
is the mutual adaptation of currents and the density field in the ocean.
An improvement in the model will make it possible to take into account the
influence of bottom relief and the ocean shores and also the wind effect.

Abstract: The reasons for long-tern varia-
tions in water volunes in rivers are devia-
tions fro. the scan values of the cliaatic
factors of runoff and the influence of econ-
onic activity. For Isost of the rivors in the
USSR the runoff nous was established in 1961.
Analysis of the results of observations froa
1961 through 1976 dennstrated that despite
the exceptionally snail water volumes of
1971-1976. affecting a great part of the
territory of the USSR, the inclusion of
these years in the preceding period allost
does not change the runoff norn. According to
data front a water use inventory in 1976 and
colputation of the channel water balances

of the principal USSR rivers. the Iagnitude
of nonreturnsble water consul-prion is 149 In: 3/
year. which is approximately 31 of the nami-
tude of the water rescurces in USSR rivers.
In Central Asia 651 of the water resources
are consued without return. in Transcaucasia
- 202. in the Northern Caucasus and Kazakh-
stan - 181. Vithin the linits of the Euro-
pean North. Siberia and the Far East the run-
off of rivers is virtually natural.

ter-ined reputedly by different authors.

In 1975. at the State hydrological Institute. in connection vith the prep-
aretion of eateriels for the General Plan for Hultisided Uea and Conserva-
tion of the Hater Resources of the USSR. specialists node a nore precise
deteraiaation of water resources [1]. The new coeputations confined the
earlier established total volume f the water resources of the USSR. lt
vee found to be equal to 6,720 k- , or. rounded off. 4,700 ice-1. Changes

in river runoff were established only in individual regions of inadequate-
ly etudied regions. These changes are in sole cases significant. For ex-
:tnple, the veter resources of Kaschatsltaya Oblast according to former coe-
putations vere 265 h3/year. but according to recent calculations - 303
u3. For Kaachatka such an increase in vater resources is considerable and
In about 25!. But the increase in the total water resources of the USSR
as a result of this is only about 11. Investigations sede earlier indicat-
cd that the total water resources of rivers in the USSR as a vhole are
quite stable. Their deviations in individual years do not exceed #101 of
the lean volue for a long-tern period [5].

The reasons for the long-tern variations of river value can be deviations

of the clisatic runoff factors fros the mean and the influence of econosic
activity.

In estineting the long-tern variations of river runoff it is necessary to
ascertain the reliability of the lean volt-a of water resources or the
runoff nor- relative to which these variations are detenined.

M is well known, the runoff nor- is the min characteristic of water re-
uources. For nest of the rivers in the USSR it was established in 1961 [6].

of the USSR vee analyzed for the purpose of checking the stability of the
runoff nors and its reliability.

At the present tine a considerable nuber of the main large rivers of the
IISSR have been regulated and reservoirs have been established on then.
Therefore. the checking of the change in river volunes during the east re-
cent tine period vee based on the inflov into reservoirs.

There are now 15 aajor reservoirs on the principal rivers.

In the analysis of variations in inflov into reservoirs it vee found that
the 10-year period fro- 1961 through 1970 was average with respect to vol-
me (the lean nodular coefficient was 0.997) and its inclusion in the long-

tern series does not change the runoff norn. The last six-year period
1971-1976 in the territory of the USSR was characterised by exceptionally
unall volu-es. A particularly low runoff volume was obserVed in the south-
ern half of the European USSR and in the southern part of western Siberia.
In the Don basin the neon nodular runoff coefficient was 0.6. in the Dnepr
hasin -- 0.75-0.83. in the Volga basin - 0.68-0.89. in the basin of the
upper Irtysh - 0.93. in the 0b' basin - 0.95. in the Yenisey basin -
0.96.

In the northern regions of the European USSR and in Eastern Siberia during
this same period the neon runoff was above the norn. In the Kass basin

the nodular coefficient was 1.02, in the Angora basin - 1.07. On the aver-
age. for all 15 large reservoirs in the territory of the USSR the nodular
inflow coefficient was 0.89. Such a low-water volune period is exceptional
for the territory of the USSR with respect to area affected and the degree
of low voluse.

Information on inflow into individual large reservoirs during the period
1971-1976 is given in Table 1.

Despite the exceptionally low volume during the period 1971-1976. affecting
a large part of the territory of the USSR. the inclusion of these years in
the series of preceding observations alsost does not change the values of
the runoff nor-s. If one arbitrarily assumes that the onset of observations
on USSR riverswnu 1n 1900(in actuality. they were initiated on the Iajor
rivers considerably earlier - in the 1870's-1880's). the inclusion of the
last six low-water years (1971-1976) in the 70-year series (1900-1970)
changes the earlier established runoff nor-s by only 12.

Thus, it is possible to consider the earlier established runoff nor-a to be
stable and the ceaputed water resources can be considered constant.

The problem of the influence of econosic activity on water resources has
been studied for a long tine.

Hater consumption and water use began with the appearance of san. but over
a long period of tine it did not alter the natural cycling of water.

During the last period of tine. approxinately since the 1950's, there has
been a change in the runoff of individual rivers under the influence of
ccenoaic activity. These changes were also known earlier. but they were
clearly asnifested only in regions of intensive development of irrigation

- in Central Asia and the Caucasus, where the waters were used for centur-
les. and possibly sillenia.

it is a widely held opinion that econonic activity leads to a decrease in
river runoff. however. in soae cases as a result of econo-ic measures the
river runoff can even increase. This can occur with an isprovenent in the
infiltration capacity of the basin, for exasple, as a result of deeper

110

plowing of the soil and an increase in the ground water reserves with a
simultaneous decrease in total evaporation.

An increase in runoff c: be a result of an excess of the discharge of

water into riVars over ta. volume of water intake from them for economic
needs.

An analysis of data on the volumes of water intake from and discharge into
rivers during 1976 indicated that in some of the most developed regions

of the European USSR the volume of water discharged into rivers exceeds the
water intake from rivers. The reason for this is that the rivers receive
not only "used” industrial, household and irrigation river waters, but also
water from ground water horizons and also mine water.

For example. it can be noted that the volume of water discharged into the
Neman, Zapednaya Dvina, Beresins. Oskol. Medveditsa and Kal'mius Rivers
exceeds the water intake. For the Oskol River this excess is 0.11 km3 and
for the Kal'mius it is 0.57 km3lyear.

A more common situation is an excess of water intake over discharge into

the river. and as a result, a decrease in river runoff as a result of econ-
ouic activity. .

An estimate of water use. that is. a direct determination of the influence

of economic activity on river runoff in the modern period, can be accomplish-
ed on the basis of a determination of the channel water balances of the
principal river systems.

The results of computations of channel water balances of the Volga. Kuben',
Dnepr, Ural, Amudar'ys and Lena Rivers for 1976, carried out at the State
Hydrological Institute. and also data from a water use inventory (intake

and discharge) for this same year, generalized for the basins of the main
rivers of the USSR and for the territories of economic regions. made it pos-
sible to determine the magnitude of nonreturn water consumption and losses
in evaporation from the water surface of reservoirs. that is. the decrease
in runoff under the influence of economic activity.

As is well known. the intake and discharge of water are determined by tech-

nological processes in industry, the area of irrigated lands and the numbers
of population.

Hater consumption by all three water users does not have marked changes with
time and within the limits of several years can be considered constant.
Therefore, the magnitude of runoff losses determined in 1976 can be adopt-
cd for the near past and future and it is possible to determine the change

in water resources under the influence of economic activity during the mod-
ern period.

Thus. an estiaate was made of the change in total runoff within the lie-
its of individual econoaic regions and in the territory of the USSR as a
whole (Table 2).

The lost significant changes in runoff as a result of nonreturn losses oc-
cur within the limits of 202 of the territory of the USSR falling in the
southern regions of intensive irrigation.

In Central Asia there is a 651 nonreturn renewal of the water resources of
rivers, in Transcaucasis -— 201. in the Northern Caucasus and in Kazakhstan
- 182 in each case. Shall runoff changes were established in the Central
Chernoses region (52) and in the Volga region (32). They are still less con-
upicuoua in the Baltic region (21) and Belorussia (1:). The enuserated regions
constitute approxisately 101 of the entire territory of the USSR.

Within the lisits of an enoraoua territory, constituting about 702 of the
area of our country, occupying the northern part of the European USSR, Hest-
ern Siberia. Eastern Siberia and the Far East. the nonreturn losses constit-
ute less than 12 of the water resources of rivers. The runoff of rivers in
this territory is virtually natural.

The total change in runoff of USSR rivers as a result of nonreturn water con-

sunption is 169 ks 3lyear. which is equal to approxisately 32 of the water re-
sources in the rivers.

If we turn to an analysis of the influence of economic activity on the run-
off of individual rivers it can be established that the greatest changes
occurred in the river basins on the s0uthern slope. For econosic needs there
is e nonreturn intake of 621 of the runoff of the Asudar' ya, 60% of the
Syrdar' ya runoff, the Terek - 63%. Kare - 612. Ural - 162, Kubaa' - 81:
each year there is a 162 reaoval froa the Dnepr. fro. the Don -- 132.

It is always of considerable interest to estiaate the changes in runoff

of the sain river of the EuropeanUSSR and the European river with the great-
est runoff volume -- the Volga. Proceeding on the basis of an inventory

of Volga water use and its channel balance, it can be established that at

the present tise the runoff of this river has changed by an average of 31.

If we also take into account additional losses in evaporation fros the Volga-
Kasa cascade of reservoirs, constituting about 2 kn 3lyeer, the total runoff
losses of the Volga will be about 62.

it is also necessary to take into account the possible changes in runoff as
a result of agricultural and silviculturel aslioration in the river basins.

This setter was investigated in detail by V. Ye. Vbdogretskiy [3]. Accord-

ing to his data. the greatest changes in runoff as a result of agricultural
and silvicultural Ielioration occurred in the southern regions of the Euro-

pean USSR. but even there they are small. The runoff changes during the per-
iod 1935-1975. according to Vodogretskiy. are equal to:

112

Volgp - l! of the long-tern nore, Dnepr -- 2!. Don -- 3!. Ural - 2!. Ir-
tysh — 22. In the renaining territory of the USSR the influence of agri-

cultural and silvicultursl neliorstion is negligible and need not be taken
into account.

The influence of agricultural and silviculturel eolioretion on the runoff
of large rivers is an order of ngxnitude less then the influence of water
use and allowance for it say not significantly change the estimates of the
influence exerted on runoff by other econoaic activity factors.

Thus. by a detersinetion of the use of water and the computation of channel
water balances of large rivers it is possible to ascertain the principal
losses of river runoff due to econoaic needs in the aodern period.

Abstract: On the basis of writing and solution
of an equation taking into account the diaper-
sivity of the snow cover and describing the pro-
cesses of sggloseration of snow particles and
their destruction, an sttespt is node to esti-
nate the time of occurrence of avalanches at

the time of snowfalls or directly after them.
Ways to develop a nethod for computing a fore-

cast of avalanches fros freshly fallen snow are
defined.

[Text] The investigations which are discussed in this conunication were
carried out for the purpose of attaining sone clarity in the problem of
the nature of the stability of a snow cover on a slope during the tiae of
n snowfall or soon after it on the basis of creation of a mathematical
scheme for estimating the snow cover.

Here we will attenpt to explain some anpirical rules and procedures taking
it possible in actual practice, under specific meteorological conditions,
in a given territory. with some degree of success to make a prediction of

the onset of the avalanche danger and we note possible ways to improve
them.

It is well known that the onset of an avalanche danger period for freshly

falling snow is reckoned from the moment when snow of a definite thickness
(20 no of water) has already fallen and the snowfall continues with an in-
tunsity not less than a definite value (3 s-lhour). Then. in the presence

of n definite thickness of the snow cover, some tine interval after cessa-
tion of the snowfall is considered dangerous for avalanches.

This indicates that freshly fallen snow can be stable on a slope. despite
its sufficiently great thickness, provided that the intensity of the snow-
fall is snll, and vice versa, with great intensities of the snowfall

111.

avalanches of snow of a small thickness can be formed. At the same time.

the danger of an avale..che is not precluded during a definite tine inter-
val after a snowfall. although the intensity of the snowfall (in centre-

diction to what has been said above) is equal to zero.

This suggests the following proposal: first, that in the case of small
(large) snowfall intensities the snowflakes succeed (do not succeed) in
becoming agglomerated end this makes the snow cover more (less) stable:
second, that in the snow cover processes can transpire which lessen its
stability even after a snowfall.

Now we will visualize that the downhill sliding of the snow occurs in the
direction of the y-axis (from left to right) and that the mean macroscopic
velocity v of its sliding increases in the direction of the roads (up-
wards). In order to simplify the investigation the snow is assumed to be
a monodisperae medias. In the snow thickness we discriminate a layer dz

- 5 (where: is the linear dimension of a snowflake) felling between the
planes s-soandz- 10+3.

If the lower-lying layer in the sliding process moves as a whole with some

neon velocity v - vo, the considered layer moves relative to it with a
mean velocity Av - av/Jz d: - av/az 8.

This movement can be assumed to be governed by a force acting on the con-
xidered layer from left to right from the direction of the next layer sit-
uated over it and tending to entrain it. This force is determined for the

most part by the process of agglomeration of snow particles belonging to
the above-mentioned slow layers. It is known from the physics of agglomer-

ation that the contact area of agglomeration between particles increases

proportional to time and the time of total agglomeration is determined by
the formula [1]

“.8810- -const exp 7'7, (1)

where w is the energy of crystal lattice disintegration. k is the Bolts-
mann constant, 1' is absolute tewerature.

Evidently, the magnitude of the force f(t) necessary for separating the
n-th particle by shear can be considered as conforming to this same lav.

Thus, the lesser (greater) is the velocity gradient 3v] 3:. the greater
(lesser) on the average is the time

2’. , do

that the particles are in contact. the greater (lesser) is the agglomera-
tion area and the greater (lesser) is f(t) and the more stably (less
stably) does the snow lie on the slope if the velocity gradient is such
that the time t falls in the interval (0, “3310.). with t) “3310.. (small

velocity gradients) £(t) - const and. accordingly, the stability of the
snow on the slope is not dependent on the velocity gradient in this range
of its values. The latter, as is easy to note. can occur for ssall snow
thicknesses or for sufficiently gentle slopes.

Obviously. the shear strength of snow can be expressed by the Eorsule
{snow - f(t)°N1, (3)

where N1 is the number of snow particle aggloneration contacts for a unit
area of the surface of the considered layer with particles of the above-

lying layer.

Thus. the shear strength of snow is dependent on the number of snow par-
ticle agglomeration contacts and its value changes not only due to an
increase in the contact area with tine, but also due to a change in the
nuber of contacts of agglonerating particles between the layers in the _
process of downward sliding of the snow. It is evident that the nusber of
contacts is dependent not only on the nunber of particles per unit area

of the surface of the considered layer, but also on the type of packing.
Evidently, it can be seemed that with an increase in the velocity gradient
in the snow thickness the probability of existence, even over a short tine
interval. of packings with a great nusber of contacts is decreased.

First we will name that on a slope we have a snow cover of a definite
thickness in which there are already active processes of aggloseratioa of
some particles and sticking with the destruction of the contacts of others.

If the nusber of possible contacts per unit of surface area between two
arbitrarily selected layers is denoted N, then the process of sggloseration
and destruction can be described by the equation

‘!7NL_-k,r,gh,-'--quv-.V.) -k:?gh.,lnx'\'l (‘)

or, introducing the dimensionless values using the formulas

iI-kmghcosu-l. Ila-NM. (5)
the latter is rewritten in fore (the lines over the letters are ositted)
where R1 and R2 are constant coefficients dependent on the velocity gradi-
ent, type of snow and totality of seteorological elesents; ho is the thick-

ness of the snow lying on the slope; P is snow density; g is the accelera-
tion of free falling; at is angle of slope.

He will examine two possible entrees cases:

116

1) At the initial aonent there is not even one agglomerating contact (N1

to which the two solutions presented above tend with tine (one downward,
another upward).

Thus. the snow lying on a slope, depending on its initial st’ate, can with
tine decrease or increase its shear stress to a definite limiting value,
expressed by equation (9). In other words, the avalanche danger after a
snowfall is dependent not only on the thickness of the snow cover, but
also on the pattern of change in the totality of meteorological alenents
accomanying a snowfall, which also determines the initial state of the
snow cover necessary for finding a special solution of equation (6).

how we will assume that snow has fallen on a bare slope with a constant in-
tensity. As a silplification of the investigation the dependence of the
agglomeration process on the normal gravity cosponent will be assued to
be the ease as the dependence of the destruction process on its tangen-
tial coaponent. that is. proportional to the intensity of the force. Then
the equation describing the agglomeration and destruction processes. for
a qualitative investigation can be written in the for-

equation (10) assuaes the fora of equation (6). It therefore follows that
the stationary solution of equation (10) and equation (6) coincide. but
the law of tendency to this solution changed greatly: the index of the ex-
ponential function became dependent on the square of tine.

It is evident that the landslide danger occurs when the tangential coupon-

Abstract: In this paper, vithin the framework
of a unified mathematical nodel. the author
examines the processes of snow melting and
thawing of the soil. in the model it is pro-
posed that standard observations be used.

in practical respects the results can find
application in agrohydrology. because the
final objective of the cmutations is a
clarification of the conditions for the ap-

pearance of a vorn ice crust and determina-
tion of the moisture reserves in the soil
after ending of snow melting. These same re-
sults also have application to computations
of the dynamics of spring high waters vith
respect to the detection of runoff losses

in infiltration into 2": ::11. .°..'. example
of the computations is given.

[Text] Intensive tlmva or spring snow melting are accompanied by thawing

or the soil and the infiltration of moisture. The quantity of percolating
uater is dependent on meteorological conditions on the eve of the thaving
and during its course. the degree of ice saturation of the soil and its
temerature. These factors determine the reserve of productive misture

hy the time of ending of the spring season and also to a considerable de-
gree the volume of surface runoff during the period of disappearance of the
snow cover. The practical importance of the stationed agrohydrological char-
acteristics explains the great attention which has been devoted to a study
of these processes by hydroeeteorologists.

The problems relating to snow melting have been examined in detail in [8.
15]. In these sources the emphasis is on the problem of deriving convenient

considerable errors in the computations. in addition. within the fro-evorh
of them». aethods there are no possibilities of tracing the dynaaics of
nelting and taking into account the influence of the soil. As a result of
this type of approaches there is no possibility of tracing the restructuring
for the tenperature fields in the snow and soil. and also the aigration of

moisture; this. in turn. does not sake it possible to proceed to cosputa-
tion of soil thawing.

There hes nov been considerable dsvelopuent of the theory of structure of
the surface layer of the ataosphere. In addition. the use of the electronic
coaputer is elilinating the problan of nunerical calculations when using

Specifically, the conutation procedure is reduced to the following. The
nosent of onset of snow aelting can in principle be determined if I at any
tine during the day becoaes greater than zero. However. for this it is neces-
sary to have inforaation on the diurnal variation of aeteorological chants
and begin checking with a great advance tine. and this coqlicates the con-
putetions. Therefore, it is possible and desirable. as an additional indi-
cation. to use the date when the aariaua daily tenperature '11,.“ becones
positive. but even then it is possible to nice situations when.“ there is a
purely solar melting. It therefore follows that it is necessary to be or-
iented on the cliaatic date of onset of aelting. However. if up to this
moment there is a case with 1", “,0 0. it can be used as the basis and
checking for l>0 begins with the corresponding data. This sass index can
and east be taken into account for detecting the moment of onset and ending
of a winter thaw. After establishing the initial date. using data fro- reg-
ularly scheduled observations. by the aethod set forth in [10), we recon-
struct the diurnal temperature variation Tb“). Then each day with an inter-
val of l hour we make coaputations of l. The values uv. (1% (j is the title

ing in each interval in the (j+l)-t interval. During periods when 1},(t)

practical use because the accuracy of the results for all intents and pur-
poses falls within the range of measurement accuracy. The more rapid dis-
appearance of the snow (in coeparison with that actually observed) can be
attributed to the absence of allowances for precipitation during the snow
aslring period; this can in principle be done without significant complic-
ations. (In the given case we did not have the appropriate data.)

Initially we determined the heat expenditures on snow nelting I. Then the
velocity of aovanent Ht). that is. v0 - dt Idt was assumed to be equal
to the rate of filtration of water in the snow v.“ - 0.05 ca/sec [0]. The
method proposed in [13] was used in solving the thernel probles in the
layer - I(t)< r<ll. after which we cosputed tho left-hand side of equation
(6) and the result was cosparsd with the I value. If A‘l. the conclusion
can therefore be drawn that the quantity of nelting moisture is sufficient-
ly great and the water aovee downward with the filtration rate. Otherwise
the zero isothara penetrates into the snow more slowly. Then its rate can

case it is necessary to have recourse to iterations, successively equating
the values on the left- and right-hand sides of equation (6).

he soon as {(t) beconss equal to zero, the noisture reaches the sell sur-
face. Then. in the presence of free porosity infiltration begins. These
processes were studied under both field conditions end by leans of labor-
atory experisente [2. 6-6. 14]. me theory of this probles is also the
subject of a nudist of studies [9. 12. 17] whose authors propose cosputs-
tion aethods based on use of the equation of noisture novenent. however.

in this case the authors strive to replace the physical relationships by

a set of coefficients. Thereby the physical sense of the latter is obscured
and. in addition. special erperinents are required for their deter-ination.
The values obtained are tied in to the specifically used conputetion nodel.

The conclusion can be drum that the use of any “ready-ads" cowutation
nodal for the problen considered here is not possible as a result of dif-
ferences in purposes and formulation. In this case we are not interested
in the field of velocities of the fluid sowing in the soil, but the condi-
tions for eccqulation and the quantity of aoistura accumulated in it.
Therefore, it is desirable that the analysis be carried out on the basis
of thernophyaicel principles. This requires allowance for interaction be-
tween the atnosphere and the thawing underlying surface by means of a joint
solution of a closed systes of transfer equations in all the nedie partic-
ipating in the process, which in the sentioned investigations was not done.

Now we will turn to an analysis of the processes trenspiring in the soil.

the Mt) plane is divided into two parts: in the lilits 0<z< .(t) the
teaperature is equal to 0°C and when h(t)< s<h(t) its negative values are
observed. Different infiltration regiaes can arise in dependence on the in-
tensity of snow thawing and the teapereturc of the freezing soil: total ab-
sorption or appearance of a layer of “supported" wisture. lbs latter can
be caused either by the total plugging of the soil pores by ice or due to
an excess of the quantity of salt water above the absorptivity of the soil.
Below we will era-ins the conditions for the appearance of each of the anus-
orated situations.

Ileat transfer upward in this case does not occur due to the absence of a

Abstract: On the basis of use of data on cyclonic
system and amoaphsric fronts the authors denon-
strate the possibility of predicting distant trans-
aigrations of insects haraful for agricultural crops
and the regions of their sass settling are deter-in-
ed. The article characterizes ways to solve this
problaa on the basis of asny-sided cooperation be-
tween the Plant Protection Service and the USSR
hydro-eteorological Service.

[Text] Agriculture in all countries experiences enoruous losses tron pests
and diseases of agricultural crops. The developsent of lost branches of
plant cultivation is mprotitable without special work on plant protec-
tion. There must be a scientifically sound prediction of the resettling.
condition and nu-ber of her-fol organism in order to for-ulate rstional
ways to prevent «sage and to plan expenditures on plant protection. it

is particularly difficult to predict those species vhich are capable of
prolonged noveaents over great distances. ‘l'heir migrations lead to enor-
nous concentrations of pests and the infliction of serious losses in agri-
cultural production.

Accordingly, it becones necessary to foresee in advance the probability.
tins and direction of transaigrations of harnful insects and the causative
agents of diseases. to deter-ine the regions of their increased concentra-
tion and the possibility of further developoent in landing places. A know-
ledge of these para-stars makes it possible to ensure tinely organisation
and routine inplenentation of a system of seasures for optinising phyto-
uanitary conditions.

In our study of the patterns of transnigrations of harmful insects as the
nodel object we used the beat webworn. a dangerous polyphageous pest which
occurs widely in the principal agricultural regions of the country. The
nature of 'the behavior. resettling and reproduction of this species are de-
pendent for the nest part on the state of environsental hydrothermal factors.
It is heat- and aoisture-leving: at a temperature below 16-l7° and an inade-
quate environaentsl noisture supply there is a marked decrease in fertility
and population. remaining harmful only at foci with favorable nicroclimatic
conditions: at a temperature above 19'c and a huaidity-teaperature coef-
ficient greater than 1.0 there is a rapid restoration of numbers and a
threat of universal mass reproduction is created. Depending on the habitat
and the weather conditions in the growing season the beet webwora can develop
in 1-3 generations. The adult stage of the insect - the butterfly — is
capable of transmigration; the damage is caused by the caterpillars. espec-
ially those of internediate and older ages [2. 3. 7].

A clarification of the factors responsible for the use movements of the
best webwora demonstrated that they usually occur when there is an inten-
sivc aultiplication of the pest and are closely associated with synoptic
processes in the atmosphere. The influence of weather differs in dependence
on the transsigration phase.

The first phase is the rising of the butterflies into the air and their
flight around within the limits of the center of reproduction (in a radius
up to 25 ha) is favored by anticyclonic weather with a predominance of
clear days or days with few clouds with a wind velocity not greater than
5 alsec. The rising up of. the butterflies is stimulated by a search for
optimum thermal conditions. It is observed primarily at twilight and at
nighttime, with a decrease in teqerature of the surface air layer to 13°
C. and also in the near-aidday hours. when it rises above 30°C. Due to the
infrequent falling of precipitation in an anticyclonic system the maturing
of butterflies under these conditions is retarded and often it ceases ea-
tirely. causing their coaplete infertility.

The second phase is distant flights of the best webworm. associated with
its mvements into other regions. The flight of the butterflies is with
the wind and therefore its direction usually coincides with the prevailing
direction of the winds. that of the insects fly at an altitude up to 100 I.
Taking into accomt the variability of wind direction and velocity. relief
conditions and the limited strength of the butterflies. it is assumed that
in 2’4 hours they can fly no are than 50 km. Accordingly. transmigration
at UN heel. wehwurm over greatest distances are favored by a stable nature
of the weather with a relatively constant direction of the winds. However.
since the transmigration of the butterflies also occurs in the higher lay-
ers of the atmosphere. not rarely without their active participation. these
concepts require further refinement.

The final phase of the transmigration - the settling of the beat webworm
within the limits of a new territory - occurs under conditions of a cyclonic
type of weather. A considerable cloud cover and prolonged falling of rain.

their subsequent developaent and reproduction. This process is manifested
noat clearly in extensive. slowly aoving cyclones. for the soot port in

their central parts and in the sons of a were front.

Thus. knowing the seteorologicnl conditions causing the beginning of dis-

However. checking of these detarained dependences and rsconendations for

years. This becaae possible only during the lest decade in connection with

Ukrainien 331! there was everywhere a great population of the beet vebworn,
and in individual centers it defied evaluation. In these regions during
the flight period of the first generation of the pest (second and third
ten-day periods in June) there wee a predoainance of hot and dry weather.
The air tenerature during the daytine hours daily exceeded 30'0 but at
nighttise dropped to 10-15% or below. The precipitation. not frequently
brief, fell once or twice during the 10-day period and constituted not sore
than $01 of the non. Such conditions favored the rising of the butterflies
into the sir end their active flight.

The predominance of an easterly flow. created by the periphery of the anti-
cyclone persisting for a long tine over Kazakhstan end the southeastern
European part of the country. caused the soveaent of the butterflies into
the western and southwestern regions of the Ukrainian ssn and the Moldavian
SSR. where during a prolonged period of ties a cyclonic pressure field was
unintained. frequent (6-7 tiaes in a 10-day period) and abundant (150-250:
of the non) precipitation in these regions cemed the seas settling of the
butterflies and their concentration in seer-nus mders. especially in the
zone of etaospheric fronts. These sane conditions ensured a high fertility
of the butterflies and favorable conditions for the feeding of the cater-

pillars. es a result of which there was considerable danage to the crops
and n decrease in their productivity.

An evaluation of the situation developing in 1975 confined that the nsin
reason for the distant flights of the beat webworn aust be regsrded as n
definite codination of weather conditions developing under the influence
of cyclonic system and fronts. An analysis of these processes lads it pos-
siblc to establish the possibility of preparing short-range predictions of
transmigration of the pest and detenining the pleces of its sass concen-
tration and harafulnass. Since the appearance of danging caterpillars

usually occurs not less than lo days after the flight of the butterflies.
such an advance warning is entirely adequate for the tiaely preparation of
field agencies for carrying out protective aeaaures.

For the purposes of practical realization of these ideas a relationship has
been established between the operational agencies of the Plant Protection
Service and the prognostic subdivisions of the State muittee on llydro-
meteorology. An agree-ant has been concluded on creative cooperation be-
tween the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Plant Protection and
the northwestern Mainistration of the State Colesltteo on Hydroseteorology.
As a result of their joint activity a syetea has been developed for drawing
up a forecast of transnigrations of the beat webwora. It is based on the
detection of regions of the uses concentration of butterflies. an analysis
of the synoptic situation within the llaite of these territories during the
last 10-15 days. and also evaluations of weather conditions at the locations
of the suraised resettling of the beet webwora. taking into account their

probable changes in the inediate future. Such predictions were node in
1976 and 1977.

For era-pie. in 1976. in connection with the extensive reaettling and good
initial state of the beet webwora. there was expected to be a nasa repro-
duction of the pest and a possibility of its distant flights. however. un-
stable cool weather with corked fluctuations in temperature and the frequent
falling of precipitation during the course of alaost the entire spring-sun
season sharply reduced the intensity of Iultiplication of the pest in nest of
its habitats. Such a nature of the weather also did not favor high rising of
the butterflies or their prolonged transnigrations. Centers of increased
density of the pest persisted for the seat part only in the southern Euro-
pean part. but the possibility of its resettling free these regions was re-
strained by the prevalence of winds of northerly directions. Taking into ac-
count the developing situation. distant transnigrations of the beet webworn
were not foreseen in the forecast. At the ease tine. it was pointed out

that during individual periods with warn dry weather and winds of southerly
and easterly directions the flight of butterflies about the area was probable.
but due to the brevity of favorable weather conditions the radius of their
flight would be insignificant. Such local migrations. in accordance with

the forecast. were noted. for exasple. during late June and during the

first ten-day period of July in the territory of the Northern Caucasus.

During l977. during the period of develop-eat of the beet webworn in the
liuropean USSR. there was a predo-inance of moderately war- weather with pre-
cipitation falling everywhere and with winds of variable directions. Such
conditions ensured the normal developuent of the pest and did not neces-
sitate 'ts transaigrstion over great distances. Insignificant mveaants of
butterflies of the generation which had survived over the winter were pre-
dicted only for brief periods of dry weather with winds of easterly direc-
tion and were observed in late April and the first days of Key froa regions
along the Lower Volga into Rostovsltsya (blast.

Favorable conditions for distant transnigrations of the beat webworn develop-
ed in 1977 within the linits of the Asiatic part of its range. During the
period of flight of butterflies of the generation which had survived the
winter (first half of June) over a great expanse of Hestern Siberia and
Kazakhstan there was hot. prinsrily dry weather with brief reins of local
inortance and s predoninance of easterly and northeasterly winds. This
favored the extensive flight of the beat webwore and the intensive trans-
port of its butterﬂies in s westerly direction. “their sass settling. as
expected. occurred in the territory of the Seuthern Urals. Hestern Kazakhstan
and the Middle Volga. where the frequent end abundant falling of precipita-
tion was observed. As a result. the population of the teat webwors in the
uentioned regions was considerably greater than could be supposed judging fro-
the nunbers of the pest surviving the winter.

An anticyclonic nature of the weather also persisted in the Asiatic territory
during the tine of flight of first-generation butterflies (second half of
July): this also ensured the possibility of their transsigration over great
distances. however. stable hot dry weather favored infertility of the beet
webworn and a reduction in its population. as a result of which the flight
ntrength of the butterflies was insignificant. Passing rains in individual
regions of Kustsnaysksya and Chelyabinshsya Oblasts caused none increase

in the intensity of pest flight. but since its population was snell. the
transsigrations. as predicted. were not of a sass character.

Predictions of the probability of transnigrations of the beat webworn were
nade available to the USSR and RSPSR Ministries of Agriculture and the All-
Union Acade-y of Agricultural Sciences. ‘l'hey nsde possible a timely orient-
ation of the Plant Protection Service on the need for carrying out prevent-
ntive and extersination plans.

At the sane tine. for a deeper study of the patterns of beet webworn trans-
nigrations and extensive autonstion of the process of collecting the neces-
sary information. joint investigations have been begun by the Main Geophys-
lcal Observatory and the All-Union Institute of Plant Protection on the pos-
sibility of using seteorological radars for these purposes. Under experinsn-
tal conditions it was possible to detersine the physical paraseters of the
butterflies and the fundanental possibility of their detection by radar
apparatus. Taking into accent the collected data. technical prerequisites
were formulated for detecting the novenents of insects using meteorolog-
lcal radars and netth were developed for neasuring the principal indices
of their flight: altitude. speed. direction. reflectivity. etc.

Such work is being carried out in our country for the first tine. It is salt-
ing possible a changeover to nodeling of the flight dynanics of the beet web-
worn and deternination of the principal links deternining the singularity

of this process in dependence on the state of the pest and physical-synop-
tic conditions in the atnosphere. In the future the fornulsted concepts and
methodological principles will be tested for predicting the transnigrations

Abstract: The article describes a radio wave
meter for measuring, and transmitting via a
radio channel. data on the height and mean
period of a wave in the coastal zone of sees.
me radio wave meter is designed for routine
hydrological support of geological prospect-
ing and other work at sea.

[Text] The specific nature of drilling work, usually carried out from small
floating bases on different parts of the shelf , in regions where usually
there are no hydromsteorological posts. iwoses additional requirements on
the means and methods for measuring wave parameters. The principal objec-
tive in hydrological support of drilling at sea is the regular routine
supplying of all drilling crews with intonation on waves. This informa-
tion must be convenient for interpretation without additional instrumental
and mathematical processing and the wave meters the-elves are reliable.
mobile and must ensure automatic measurement, processing and transmission
of the generalized statistical characteristics in the system of dispatcher
radio coumication of a geological expedition [lo]. Among the types of
wave meters known in our country for the ahove-aentioned purpose we can
recomsend only several instruments, such as the Git-61 coastal recording
wave neter [l] and the 62-2 self-contained radio wave meter.

1he 02-2 radio wave meter was specially developed for solving problese in
the hydrological support of geological reconnaissance work at sen. It makes
it possible to measure and transmit. through a radio channel. the mean cher-
ncteristice of waves in digital form. Special receiving apparatus is not re-
quired. Intonation is received directly by car from the loud speaker of a
standard geological radio station of the "Karat-I1” type. has processing of
measurements. determination of the mean characteristics of waves, coding

As the wave sensor in the radio wave meter we used an electric contact bee-
con. Using a pulsed converter, designed in the fore: of triggers connected
to each beacon contact. any closing of a contact by the water is converted
into a counting pulse. The function of blocking of repeated counting pulses
from each contact during a wave period is performed by nesory triggers con-
nected in series with the converter triggers. Thus. the height of an indi-
vidual wave is converted into a number of seaory switchings proportional

to it. in this way there is exclusion of the secondary wave fluctuations
above (below) neen sea level. Figure 1 shows a diagran of converter opera-
tion.

A device for setting the emery triggers in a zero position and a wave
counter are connected to the contact situated near nean sea level for the
registry and counting of individual waves.

In regarding the cloeinga of definite contocta ea independent neaaureeente

An incorrect detereination of the nean aea level contact by the aeaauring

ratio of the nuher of errora to the total value of the cute. Figure 3
show curvea of the dependence of error frequency in operation of the lean

ternining lean aea level. Soee diacrepanciea were noted in the ceae of wave

We note in concluaion that the limits in aeaouring lean wave height with

independent period of operation ia up to one aonth; the error in datereining

The described radio wave eeter can be teoyed in the hydrological euppo:t

Abstract: This article is devoted to the prob-
lems involved in organization and effective-
ness of hydroseteorological support of the
fishing industry and merchant marine. The
rational use of data from shipboard observa-
tions, aerial reconnaissance. observations

at shore stations, all these yield an apprec-
iable economic effect (60 million rubles an-
nually from the servicing of the fishing fleet
alone by synoptic groups). An important role in
the hydromsteorological servicing is played by
the development, by the institutes of the State
Conittee on Hydrometeorology, of methodolog-
ical principles for predicting natural pheno-
mans, both those dangerous for the fishing
fleet and those exerting an influence on
physicochemical and biochemical processes

in the water medium which exert a direct influ-
ence on links in the biological chain of the
world ocean, as well as the preparation of
regine-reference Ianuals for fishing regions.

[Text] Scientific-operational hydroneteorological servicing of Ian's econ-
osic activity is arising and developing under the influence of practical
need, the requirements of production. In turn, hydroesteorological ser-
vicing, including, in particular, extensive hydrometeorologicsl informa-
tion, scientific forecasts and sound computations, is itself beginning

to exert an influence on production and is becoming a cosponent part of it.

ly being decisive. In connection with the growth and developnent of the
ocean fleet. the exploitation of new fishing regions. poorly studied in
llydroneteorological respects. situated hundreds and thousands of siles

fron shore bases and ports. the use of diversified and coaplex catching
gear and procedures, the hydrousteorological support of the fishing fleets
and expeditions by weather bureaus has become exceedingly difficult. of a
low level of effectiveness. and frequently even iapossible. Conditions have
required new. more aodern ferns and netlmde for the hydrousteorological sup-
port of the fishing expeditions and fleet.

Synoptic groups servicing the nerchant narine and fishing expeditions in
the northern sees and the Atlantic were organised in 1950 aboard the ships
and floating bases departing for work froa Hurnanslt [26]. In the late 1950's
the servicing of fishing expeditions in the North Sea and in the Norwegian
Sea by such groups began. In 1960 a synoptic group was dispatched fron Pet-
ropavlovek-Kanchstskiy for servicing the fishing fleet in the northern part
of the Pacific Ocean. the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea [31]. In 1961
n synoptic group fron Vladivostok serviced the catching of cololabis and
herring in the southern Kurile Islands [20]. “this was followed by the ser-
vicing of expeditions in Antarctic waters by synoptic groups from Klsypeds,
Kaliningrad and Odessa. Later the groups were enlarged and an oceanologist
was included: they were outfitted with aodern receiving-transmitting and
facaiaile apparatus and are being transfer-ed into large floating hydro-
neteorological bureaus. ‘lhe experience of the first synoptic groups was
extended to all regions of the open seas and oceans where the fishing ex-
peditions of the Soviet Union work. During recent years the servicing of
ships in the fishing industry and fleet is also carried out by synoptic
groups based on scientific research weather ships in the Atlantic [16].

Host of the fishing regions of the world ocean are characterized by severe
hydroncteorological conditions. For examle, in the North Atlantic the mean
frequency of recurrence of storn winds with a velocity of 15 ls/sec or more
«luring the winter is sore than 602; the continuous duration of a stora at-
tains J-b days, the wind velocity attains $0 slut and the wave height at-
tains up to 25 n [6]. Many fishing regions of seas in the northern basin
and the North Atlantic (Barents Sea. Greenland See, Davis Strait, Labrador
shelf, etc.) a considerable part of the year are locked in heavy ice [1?],
are in a zone of noderate and heavy icing. As a whole. over the water area
of the fishing regions of the northern seas and the North Atlantic during
the year there are 80 or sore particularly dangerous hydrooeteorological
phenonena for ships of the fishing industry and fleet.

11ie fishing regions of the Bering Sea. Sea of Okhotslt and Sea of Japan and
:he northern part of the Pacific Ocean are also characterized by intensive
cyclonic activity; the average for the year here is more than 120 cyclones
and about 20-22 typhoons. In the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotak and along
the shores of Alaska during the winter season there is an exceptionally
heavy icing, leading to ship dauge and destruction. In these very sans re-
gions fishing is sude difficult by floating ice.

Floating antarctic ice and icebergs during winter in the entire antarctic
zone reach 50's and constitute a serious danger for fishing in these re-
alone.

All this puts the hydroseteorolOgical servicing of fishing expeditions in
the open sea in the ranks of the least important tasks of the USSR State
Cos-sittee on llydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring.

At the present time there are 6-11 synoptic groupn operating simultaneous-
ly in different parts of the world ocean. 1hey are servicing hundreds of
fishing ships. Each group consists of S to 7 persons. During the course

of the day the forecaster and the oceanologist repeatedly consult the
fishing director and the conference of captains. where the natter of the
disposition of the fleet is discussed and solved. Each year the synoptic
uroups and the weather bureaus carry out the servicing of runs made by
floating docks. floating cranes and convoys of vessels with a short naviga-

tional range. many of which oust travel great distances from Europe to the
ports of the Far East. Atlantic. etc. '

For successful work of a synoptic group use is made of all the hydroseteor-
ulngical and synoptic material received from Soviet and foreign centers in '
the particular region: surface charts for all the observation tines. pres-

sure pattern charts. infomtion on tropical cyclones. etc.

The successful hydroneteorological servicing of the fishing industry is al-
so favored by the great amount of work carried out by the administrations
of the State Co-ittee on hydrouteorology and institutes on the organiza-
tion or an observations service and expeditions.

Already at the beginning of the century Nikolay Mikhaylovich Knipovich
wrote that without the organization of large special sea expeditions and
regular voyages, which must be developed quantitatively and qualitatively,
without an adequate study of environmental conditions and the totality of
phenomena transpiring in the atmosphere, hydrosphere and in space in their
unity. interdependence and intercausality. the rational use of natural re-
sources is unthinkable.

Due to the great amount of work carried out by the State Gonittee on Hydro-
neteorology and the agencies of the fishing industry and fleet. we have
auto than 1.800 shipboard stations without standard observers. half of
which are based on fishing and reconnaissance vessels of the fishing indus-
try. They carry out observations and transmit to different data collection

renters the results of more than 2,000 observations per day from different

regions of the world ocean frequently completely uncovered by hydrometeor-
"logical observations. And although this information is exceptionally valu-
able for hydrometeorologicel and fishing science and practice. we still
have not done everything for it to be complete. that it be of a high qual-
ity and that it be received on time. For example, most ships for different
reasons transmit sue-aries for the nighttime observation times with a lag

up to six hours. The observations fron sons ships are of a low quality.

For sany years now all hydroneteorological agencies have sade extensive use
of photographs fro. our earth satellites for are precise deternination of
the location of pressure centers, in frontal analysis, and in detecting the
presence of fog and precipitation. Satellite infatuation is of great isport-
ance in evaluating ice conditions and deteraining the edge of the ice in
northern and far Eastern basins.

During recent years in alaost all basins specialists have been carrying out
leasureaents of surface teaperature of the sea using a radiation theraoaeter
froa an aircraft incidentally with the carrying out of ice reconnaissance
and deternination of the position of the ice edge (28]. The frequency of
the flights and the position of the runs are determined for the most part
by fishing and transport objectives and also by the goal of obtaining re-
niae characteristics, coaputstions and predictions of the theraal structure
of surface waters, prediction of the onset of ice phases and the position
of the ice edge. Specialists have developed and are successfully using a
method for coaputing the teaperature of the surface and surface layer of
seas on the basis of esterials from aerial thermal surveys [10].

Joint flights of workers in the fish reconnaissance service and shipboard
:nydrologists of the State Conittee on Hydromteorology are the practice;
this aakes possible the tiaely introduction of corrections into the organ-
iration of search for the catching of schools of fish and gives a great
econosic effect. For exanple. in the Far East. in the Kurile-Iiokkaido re-
gion. this asthod for the search for fish in a nusber of cases nde it pos-
sible to increase the productivity of fishing by a factor of 2-3. In soae
cases the data from such reconnaissances sake it possible to prolong the
voyage and navigation season.

For the servicing of the fishing industry extensive use is aade of infer-
stion free our scientific research ships. uhich operate in all northern and
Far Eastern seas, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Standard and ”secular"
sections for determining the dynamics of the principal currents. fronts.
etc. are of inestiaable inportance. For aore than 80 years there have been
regular observations of the hydrological section along the Kola meridian

in the Barents See; these are being used successfully in preparing aany
meteorological. hydrological and fishing forecasts.

The high require-ants imsed by the fishing industry agencies on our infor-
nation and servicing are forcing hydroaeteorologists to work on constant
reconnaissance. For exaaple. the aultisided hydroseteorological servicing
of the fishing fleet in the Labrador region. first initiated by specialists
of the lluraansk Administration of the liydroaeteorological Service in the
late l960's-early 1970's, using synoptic groups. a ship perforaing the role

of an "ice patrol." and a helicopter for ice aerial reconnaissance. is find-
ing broad use in other fishing regions. for examle. the econosic effect

obtained as a result of a knowledge of ice conditions and the saving in
fishing tile. is about 2 Iillion rubles [21].

The success of work of the synoptic group is determined by the fact that be-
ing with the fleet. the weatheraan and the oceanologist concentrate their
attention. aaong the entire diversity of hydrosneteorological factors char-
acterising the weather and the hydrological regime, on the ones which are
the east inortant. exerting the greatest influence on the results of fish-
ing and the safety of navigation (wind. waves. icing, water temperature,

ice conditions and deterioration of visibility). A knowledge of the actual
and predicted weather and extensive inforaation on hydroaeteorological and
ice conditions in this region enable the fishing director to plan correctly
the operation of the fleet, on a routine basis, with a knowledge of the

actual conditions, to project its relocation, and to achieve a high effec-
tiveness of fishing.

The total econoaic effect free servicing of the fishing fleet of our coun-
try by synoptic groups is increasing annually and is about 60 aillion rubles.
which is several orders of magnitude greater than the expenditures on the
mintenence of the synoptic groups. And it is entirely natural that great
attention is devoted to this problel in the draft of the national progra-

on oceanology for fisheries.

Hydroeeteorological servicing carried out froe ashore has not lost its in-
portance.

The leading workers and specialists of the hydroneteorological service.
weatherman and oeeanologists are participating in the work and are present-
ing reports at the fishing councils of fleets, combines and ministries.

In the fishing councils a decision about the redisposition of the great
fleet. dispersed in many seas and oceans, is asde taking into account the
anticipated hydroaeteorological conditions.

For emaple. each day for aarine and fishing organizations of the northern
basin specialists prepare about 80 forecasts and warnings which are sent to

270 addresses. They also prepare forecasts and consultations at the request

of captains of ships. the directors and dispatchers of fleets; each day they
are sent out to note ther 2.000 addresses.

The agencies of the State (Io-ittee on Hydmneteorology have data on the
disposition of the fleet; this lakes it possible, differentially, to issue
forecasts, warnings and consultations for individual squares in the sea.
taking into account the type of fishing and the navigation region. The opin-
ion of the wenthemen and oceanologists are of decisive importance in deter-
mining the order of movement of the ships, the choice of the route to be
taken, the places for refuge and the lost favorable tine for carrying out
the work. Great attention is devoted to the servicing of sea ports, where
there is a concentration of a great nulber of ships and there is an enor-ous

flow of freight: here the stern warning service is particularly well organ-
ited.

In the event of receipt of a hurricane waming, special neasures are taken

in the port for the tying-up of ships at wharves, the watch aboard ships is
strengthened, and the captains and fleet directors are called by radio, tele-
vision and ship's telephone. During the last 10 years a total of 120 strong
stores have been observed in ports along the shores of the northern basin.
They were all predicted a sufficient tine in advance. asking it possible to
avoid possible losses and to register a conditional econonic effect of about
18 nillion rubles.

During recent years the servicing of ships with the soot advantageous navig-
tion routes through the ocean in dependence on hydroeeteorologicsl conditions
has gained greet popularity anong navigators. 'lhe basis for this nethod is.
taking into account forecasts of weather and hydrological conditions in the
ocean, for several days in advance to conpute such a route on which the ship
will experience a ainiwa loss of speed (lo, 5]. The nuber of vessels using
the recs—endations of the State Co-ittee on Rydroneteorology is systelat-
ically increasing. In the world ocean each year about 3,000 ships of the
USSR are serviced by recs-tended courses; this gives a savings of froa 7 to
10 hours travel tine per voyage and the total economic effect is up to 3.5
nillion rubles per year.

In the practice of servicing of the fishing industry and fleet, during re-
cent years there has been continuous around-the-clock transnission of fore-
casts and stor- warnings by special radio stations in Humansk, Odessa,
Yuthno-Sakhalinsk and other ports. The watch navigator at any tins of day
can switch on his radio receiver and learn the weather, hydrological and
ice conditions in the fishing region, along the navigation route or in the
port of destination.

An effective hydroeeteorologicsl support of the fishing industry in the
oceans and sees is attained when there is a good scientific-aethodological
hose.

One of the principal tasks of scientists of the Hydrometeorological Service
Is the fornulation of nethodelogical principles for the prediction of hydro-
neteorological phenonena, and in particular, phenomena which are dangerous
and particularly dangerous for the fishing industry and fleet. as well as
the preparation of different regime-reference annuals on present-day and
pronising fishing regions.

A nuaber of scientific investigations have been devoted to study of the dy-
nanics of the atmosphere deter-ining the laws of for-atiOn and distribution
of cyclones, typhoons, stern-driven waves, icing of ships, position of the
ice edge and icebergs. For example, during recent years specialists have
developed a synoptic-statistical nethod for predicting the novenent of
typlwutw in Pet Eastern seas for a period of 1-3 days [23] and physical-

statistical aethods for predicting stern winds in the North Atlantic and
other fishing regions [22, 25].

On the basis of the spectral theory of waves and generalization of numer-
ous data from instruentsl observations it has been possible to refine ex-
isting and develop new methods for computing and predicting wave fields [12.

26], in particular, for the North Atlantic, Barents Sea. Norwegian Sea and
Greenland Sea.

A detailed study has been made of the physical conditions for the appear-
nnce of the icing of ships [13, 15]. Synoptic and numerical methods have
been developed end introduced into practice for predicting icing in the
north polar regions [13. l9]: these are being employed successfully for
issuing warnings to fishing expeditions and ships, this msking it possible
to prevent the entry of ships into zones of icing end to avoid damage.

Important investigations of the ice regime were carried out for the fishing
regions of the Northwestern Atlantic. Barents Sea. Greenland Sea, Bering
Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk. Methods for the long-range forecasting of the
total ice content and position of the ice edge for these regions and the 9*“
tremnl boundaries of distribution of icebergs were determined; computed
undels of ice drift in dependence on hydrometeorologicel conditions were
obtained [7. 17]. Experimental investigations are being carried out to de-

termine the dynamics of the ice cover with the use of modern technical means
and methods.

Effective fishing and the safety of navigation are deternined to a consider-
able degree by visibility conditions, especially in regions with a great
concentration of fishing ships. 0n the basis of experimental investigations
In study was made of the physical conditions of formation of sea fogs and
methods have been developed for predicting them [32], as is also the case
for evaporation fogs in northern seas [27]. The economic effect is more than
one million rubles simply as a result of warnings of the appearance of evap-
oration fogs for the fishing industry in the northern basin during winter.

The success of fishing is dependent to a considerable degree on the physico-
chenical and biochemical processes transpiring in the water medium, which
exert a direct influence on intermediate links of the biological chains in
the world ocean. In these processes an imrtmt role is played by water
temperature, characterizing the habitat of co-ercial fish. Investigations
of the horizontal and vertical structure of the temperature fields in sea
water make it possible to detect themlly homogeneous water masses and to
ascertain the position of hydrological fronts and the boundary of the sea-
Mona]. themcline.

A study of formation of water teaperature fields. development of methods
for predicting the thermal state of the sea. and determination of relation-

ships to fishing can be found in a great nuber of publications of the
Institutes of the State Committee on Nydrometeorology, the USSR Ministry of

[3. ll. 16. 18]. These investigations are based on extensive nultisided
experiaental studies. also carried out within the framework of national and
international progress: ”POLBKS.” "sauna." "merits." "DIM“ and others.
The State Uemittec on llydruncteorology 1. taking an “no. part in those
prograns and is carrying out independent research in this direction.

A series of practical reference nanuals has been prepared for fishing and
navigation. For example. the USSR Register has published the reference book
men I VOW V exam I mum: (Wind and waves in the Oceans and Seas)
[6]: it contains the nest couplets inforsation on the frequency of recurr-
ence end guaranteed probability of wind velocities and wave heights in the
world ocean. The work of prognostic agencies is also based on wave and wind

atlases [2] published by the Uydroaeteorologicel Service in a «non forest
and covering the principal fishing regions. Atlases of dangerous and espec-
ially dangerous hydroeeteorological phenouna are being prepared for these
seas regions. They will give the stochastic characteristics of the wind.
waves. icing of ships and ice conditions. Provision has also been ends for
the issuance of a series of atlases of standard synoptic situations deter-
sining especially dangerous hydmseteorological phenoaena in the northern
parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. in northern and Far Eastern seas.

we feel that the specialists of the State conittee on Hydroseteorology and
the USSR Ministry of Fisheries sust work out long-range plans for the prep-
aration. pdlication and adoption of hydrosetaorologicsl meals in accord-
:nnce with the long-tern plans for the develop-sat of fishing.

The State Oceanographic Institute and a nusber of other institutes at the
present tine are refining the list of requirements on the accuracy. dis-
creteness. ranges and other characteristics of paraseters which must be
seasured aboard scientific research ships. The institutes of the Ministry
of Fisheries aust also be involved in this work.

On the basis of sodern concepts concerning the significant nonstationarity
and variability of oceanographic fields (fluctuations in the thernocline.
stratification and inhongeneity) it is desirable to determine the require-

ncnts isposed on oceanographic seasuresents along profiles in fishing re-
pious and interpretation of the collected data [1. 8, 9. 29. 30].

It not be deter-ined whether it is legitiaste to use tenperature data col-
lected along profiles several days and a week before. and especially. in
the organisation of reconnaissance and fishing.

In the great. aultisided and cosplex task of hydroneteorological support
of the fishing industry and fleet there are my shortconings and unsolved

probless which are constantly being worked on by groups of scientists and
specialists at institutes and local adsinistrations of the USSR State Gos-
sittee on liydroneteorology and Monitoring of the anironsent.

the well-known general ”infatuation explosion” there is a really enoreously
increesing number of investigations of nonlinear processes. The foreulation
of nonlinear natheeeticel sodels sufficiently well reflecting the physical
process is a difficult problee. but its solution is necessery. 0n the oth-

solving linear problem: ”purely" nonlinear solutions are the exception and
not the rule.

An ennlysis of the nethenaticel formulation of the problem oust begin with
an enelysis of the physical essence: otherwise it is possible to ”construct"

the nethods for such a preliminery enclysis is the eothod based on an en-

heat source. it is shown how it is possible to solve the paradox which
arises. provided there is introduction of a new concept -- self-similarity
at the second kind. The sense of this concept is deterslned by a nonunifora
limiting ’frnnsition free a nun-self-siailar probleie to a self-sisilar prob-
lea. that in, one in which the values of the unknown functions at different
aoeents in tine can be found by a trensforeetion of sisilarity.

in the next nine chapters the author uses the introduced concept in solving
different problans of both a physical and a netheeatical character. In order
to give sole idea concerning the breadth of the probless involved and the
constructiveness of the introduced concept. we will cite the titles of the
subsequent chapters with brief co-enteries on then (given in parentheses).

shock wave Front and the Problem of a Brief Ispact: Self-Similar Solutions
of the Second Kind.

Chapter 5. Classification of Self-Siailar Solutions. (“the author defines

two kinds of self-similar solutions: first kind .. regular self-ainilarity.
here the eethoda of sieilerity theory are applicable vithout reservations:
the second kind is irregular self-similarity. Here ”self-sinner“ variables

in a general case cannot be detersinad from the concepts of sisilerity

11mm. the. concepts of intermediate asymptotics and self-similarity of the
second kind introduced by G. I. nsrenblatt proved to be an effective work-
ing tool for research, in seeking solutions and in interpreting an extreme-
ly broad range of physical problems.

As usual. n new concept Is not always deemed to be absolutely acceptable
or even unquestionable. even with respect to its name. In physics we know
of those processes vhich after ”entry" into an asymptotic regime begin
their "second life," in which they have their own asymptotic fora. In such
n case it is also natural to call the first asymptotic form "intermediate."
A clear example of this is the process of adaptation of the pressure and
wind fields in the etnosphere. in the extratropical sons: after establish-
ing a geostrophic correspondence (first asymptotic regime) all the geo-
strophics under the influence or the Rossby ,B-effect is slowly turned

and drawn out along a circle of latitude (second asysptotic regise). It

is a pity that the author olnost novhere uses Ieteorologicol applications
other than turbulence theory.

One thing is unquestionable: the book is very useful to a broad range of
investigators of linear and especially nonlinear processes in any branches
of physics. The book is ispossiblc to obtain. Ihercforc, in place of an
entirely merited conpliment to the Gidroneteoizdet for a very well pro-
dsted publication of this sonogreph. I end with e reproach for the dearly
mﬂeer of copies printed - only 2,000.

[Review by Candidate of Geographical Sciences A. V. Plashchev]

[Text] During recent years a great nuﬁer of monographs and scientific

works have been published in our country in the field of hydroneteorology.
For the last part they are addressed to specialists. However, uany readers
who are not specialists in this field would like to know what the channels
of our rivers were like thousands of years ago, what is responsible for the
marked changes in weather and how Our climate and environsent would change
in connection with the proposed southward shifting of part of the runoff of

northern and Siberian rivers. And they would like to obtain answers to many
other questions.

The reader has been waiting for interesting popular science books to be writt-
en on this subject. For the tine being, unfortunately, there are very few
such books, particularly in the field of hydrology. Therefore, the publica-
tion of the book by I. V. Popov, entitled ZAGADKI RBMOGO RUSLA (Mysteries
of the River Chanel), must be welconed.

At the present tine the problems related to study of deforuations of river
channels and floodplains are extrusely tilely. Very frequently they deter-
mine the fate of nany structures in the river channel and on the floodplain.
He can cite any exasples when a river has destroyed water intake structures
or when a river has left its channel and has washed away foundations, the
supports of power transmission lines. puping stations and other structures
on pipelines. And the reason is always the sane - the engineers planning
these structures did not take into account the cones of the channel process
or river channel deformations.

This book is devoted to an exposition of the principles of the hydronorpho-
logical theory of the channel process, in whose formulation the author of
this book participated. At the ease tile it is a sort of caution to design-

ers and builders, reminding the- of the need to take possible channel changes
into account.

The book consists of two parts. The first is called "Short Stories About
the River Channel." These are stories about what man did not make pro-
vision for and what happened because of this. Their author is a well-known
scientist in the field of investigation of the norphology of river chan-
nels and the develop-ent of sethods for their rational use. lie and his
students on many occasions have gone out into different regions in the
USSR in order to sake on-site evaluations of the coaplex nature of the

channel process and to observe the further course of river channel defore-
stion.

The second part is entitled "Hhat is the Nature of the Hydromrphologicsl
Theory of the Channel Process.” he begins this with the question: ”now
Old are Our Rivers?" In reading this section, the reader gets an idea on

how to deternine the age of a river channel. about the relationship be-
tween age and glaciation and recent defomtions.

Before explaining to the reader the essence of the hydronorphological
theory of channel processes. the author tells how it is possible to deter-
sine the age of a river, about reversible and irreversible deformations
of the river channel. runoif of sediments, laws of notion of suspended
and bottom sediasnts. types of channel process. etc. The knowledge obtain-
ed on this and other matters will assist the reader in conprehending the
hydronorphological theory. its practical applications.

In conclusion the author expresses the opinion that regional specialists.
school children and students at technical schools and colleges can par-
ticipate in and contribute such to channel investigations. The infom-
tion which they collect on channel deforutions can find practical use.

He hope that in the i-ediate future professional hydrologists will write
Isny interesting popular science books.

K. P. Voskrasenekiy began his activity in the field of hydrology with the
study of channel processes at the State hydrological Institute. During 1931-
1936 he actively participated in the work of the Amudar‘ya Channel Station,
in investigations of the channel regime of the Volga. Oka. the rivers of

the Caucasus and the Par Bast. During the prewar period (1937-1961) K. P.
‘loskresenskiy carried out a series of investigations in the field of hydro-
logical forecasts. he participated in the development of the scientific prin-
ciples of a method for predicting the water regine of large rivers in the
USSR.

During the period of the Great Fatherland Her Konstantin Petrovich was in

the Soviet Army; he participated in the battles at Leningrad and was ser-
iously wounded. Beginning in 1965. and for 25 years. he headed the key sci-
entific subdivision of the State Hydrological Institute - the Rater Bal-
ance and Runoff Oonputation Division. Beginning with that time the scientific
interests of Konstantin Petrovich were closely associated with solution of
the central prohlens in hydrological engineering - the development of new.
and improvement of existing. methods for computing runoff during construc-
tion planning. The results of his investigations in this field were complet-
ed by the preparation of three scientific nonographa in 19684953. in 1956

he published a monograph entitled GIDROUOGICHESKIYE RASCHBTY PR1 PROYRKTIRO-

[Text] The Fifth All-Union Conference on Radiometeorology was held in lush-
inev during the period 15-19 May 1978. he conference was attended by about
160 representatives of 143 organizations in the Soviet Union. Specialists from
C:SSR and the GDR were present as conference guests.

At the conference there were representatives of 16 organisations of the State
Couittee on hydrometeorology. six institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences,
9 colleges of the Ministry of Higher and Intermediate Education USSR, and 11
organizations of industrial ninistries and departments.

A total of 12 reviews and 93 reports and comications were presented in two
sections at the three sessions.

The reports denonstrated the results of scientific research work in the field
of new applications of radiophyeical equipnent and methods in meteorology. in
the creation of specialized apparatus. and accumulation of experience in the
processing, dissemination and use of the collected intonation. At the confer-
ence great attention was devoted to investigations of clouds and precipita-
tion using radiometric apparatus, laser and acoustic sounding, and also radio-
metric determination of the profiles of meteorological elements in the lower

troposphere.

During the time which has elapsed since the Fourth All-Union Conference, held
In [975. definite successes have been achieved in radar measurements of pre-
cipitation. in the detection and short-range forecasting of dangerous pheno-
nenn, in the study of nesoscale flows in clouds, and in isprovement in radar
servicing of hail protection services. At the sane time new apparatus has been
created and existing equipment has been improved for the processing. analysis
and dissemination of data obtained using radars. A new generation of aeteor-
oiogical radars is being introduced in the subdivisions of the antihail ser-
vice.

Also being developed are new principles of radiophysical methods for study-
ing the structure. dynamics and electric characteristics of clouds. There
has been iaproveeent in the interpretation of radar measures-ence and also

observations of the geometrical and microphyaical characteristics of clouds
and fogs. Definite possibilities for measuring the liquid water content of
clouds and the intensity of precipitation during synchronous radar and radio-
metric observations have been established.

Theoretical and experimental investigations have made it possible to estimate
the ranges of wavelengths promising for radiometric scasurements of atmospher-
ic parameters. Specialists have also developed principles and methods for
radioacoustic sounding of the stunsphere. Theoretical and experimental stud-
iea have been made of the possibilities of interpreting the results.

A conference resolution noted the generally successful development of work
on problems relating to radiometeorology, broadening of interest and partic-
ipation of scientific cadres of the State Oomittea on Hydrometeorology and
other organizations in carrying out investigations, developing apparatus and
applying measurements and observations. At the same time, the resolution not-
ed:

- the need for intensification of work on the metrological support of re-
note, radar, radioeetric, lidsr and acoustic eeasurements;

- the desirability of creating specialized polygons outfitted with instru-
ments and equipment for the reliable interpretation of data from remote meas-
urements;

- the timeliness of developing methods and apparatus for the multisided en-
ulysis of information from the network of meteorological radars on the basis
of use of modern computers;

- the need for a deeper study of the needs of users for infomtion obtained
by remote methods for routine and scientific research purposes. Particular
attention must be devoted to a shortening of the time required for practical
introduction of the developed radiophyaical instruments and methods.

lhe conference aces-ended that particular attention be given to:

— development and improvement of means for the detection and identification
of dangerous weather phenomena for the purpose of short-range forecasting
and artificial modification;

- creation of remote methods for determining the profile of meteorological
elements to an altitude of 2-3 km for the servicing of aviation and the pre-
diction of atmospheric contamination;

— realization of a measuring system, including meteorological radars and
small electronic computers, for storm warnings and measurements of precipit-
ntion over great areas;

— development of methods for determining gas components in the atmosphere
(carbon dioxide, water vapor, nitrogen) applicable to environmental problems;
- broadening of work favoring the use of radiometeorological methods in
scientific-research problems in atmospheric physics, such as study of clouds

and precipitation, air currents in clouds, clear-sky turbulence and predic-
tion of hail activity.

In the field of investigation of the influence of meteorological processes
on radio wave propagation the conference deem the following desirable:

166

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

-- theoretical and experimental study of the mechanism of radiation trans-
fer, taking into account the influence of the underlying surface;

- continuation of work an investigation of the spatial distribution of
the refractive index and absorbing properties of the troposphere;
- development of statistically supported models of the atmosphere and
the phenomena trnnspiring in it applicable to determination of the influ-
ence of meteorological conditions on radio wave propagation;
- study of the structure of precipitation fields in different climatic
zones for problems involved in maintaining radio communication via space
vehicles.

In June 1978 the State Committee on Hydrometeorology held an interdepart-
mental conference on problems relating to investigations in the field of
applied climatology and improvement in the system for supplying the
national economy with data on the climate of the USSR.

The conference was opened by S. K. Cherkavskiy, head of the Hydrometeorolog-
ical Services Division of the State Committee on Hydrometeorology. In an
introductory speech he noted that recently there has been a continuous
increase in the requirements on climatic information both with respect to
direct data on climate over a long period of years and with respect to the
methods for determining the climatic parameters with different frequencies
of recurrence and climatic resources on the basis of the characteristics of
an oblast, kray and republic.

This phenomenon is caused by a number of circumstances, the most important
of which are:

- development of industrial, transportation, agricultural and urban con-
struction in regions of Siberia and the Far East. Central Asia and Kazakh-
stan, where climatic conditions exert a substantial influence on construc-
tion work, operation of transportation. agricultural production and condi-
tions for the work and the life of the people;

-- use of new types of construction of structures. including high (up to
500 m) structures, new construction materials;

-- an increase in the technical level in construction planning and a more
complete allowance for climatic factors for the purpose of increasing the
reliability of operation of structures and reducing their cost:

- increasing requirements on the creation of comfort of the environment
of cities by means of a more complete allowance for the peculiarities of
climate in their building:

- a more complete allowance for the resources of heat, moisture, snow and
wind power resources in the national economy (agriculture, power, etc.);
- development of measures for preserving the environment;

-- improvement of national and departmental standards associated with cli-
matic conditions (expenditure of heat, special clothing, etc.).

The problems involved in climate, its natural variations and changes as a
result of anthropogenic factors, have attracted the attention of many in-
ternational organizations. Profound scientific investigations of this prob-
lem must be carried out.

The USSR State Cousittee on llydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring
is proposing that an inventory (reference annual) on the clients of the
USSR be prepared.

The first deputy chairman of the State Cosmittee on llydronetcorology Yu. S.
Sedunov noted the usefulness of the conference, the materials of which will
enable us to understand how the national economy is supplied with data on
climate. In this connection the Main Geophysical Observatory mat deter-
nine what must be done in order to iaprove clisatic servicing to users and
give solutions for the following problene. Are there enough observation
points for covering the territory in clinatic respects? h‘hat should be the
accuracy of observations. the usefulness of the collected data, the com-

pleteness of the set of observed parameters? To what degree do the publish-
ed generalizations on the climate of the country satisfy users? What must

be done in order to ensure specialized clinatic servicing of different
branches of the national economy?

In principle. such servicing nest be carried out on the basis of a data
bank registered on technical carriers. A "question-response" system must
he created for routine use.

At the present time the problems related directly to clinstic data are tied

in to the problem involved in contamination of the environment and climatic
change.

It is also necessary to bring into order the system of scientific develop-
meats. devoting particular attention to trends in small regions. to sys-
tenatise data for foreign territories, to increase the mﬂer of climatic
parameters and their complexes.

Ye. P. Borisenkov. director of the Main Geophysical Observatory. presented
a report entitled "Physical Principles of Climate. Status of the Theory of
Investigations in the Field of Applied Climatology and Prospects for its
Development," in which he gave a brief characterisation of the USSR national
program for study of the physical principles of clinete end its change, and
also reported on the status of investigations in the field of applied cli—
ustology.

A report entitled “Status and Prospects of Servicing the National Econoay
with Data on Climate, Fundamental Principles for Conducting an Inventory
of the Climate of the USSR" was presented by the deputy chief of the Admin-
istration of Hydmneteorological Servicing of the State Oouittee on Hydro-
meteorology. c. c. Sivoplyas.

The speaker told about the present status of servicing the different branch-
es of the national economy with cliuatic data; he noted the shortconings in
this work and reported on the prospects for the future.

The conference also heard a report on a draft of the PoleileA 0 KADASTRE

l’o KLIHATU 888]! (Principles of a Clintic Inventory of the USSR) (handbook
on the climate of the USSR). 168

It ie'proposed that the inventory will be intended for supplying interest-
ed organisations, enterprises and institutes with information on the cli-
natic resources (including heliopower and wind power) and the climatic
parameters in the territory of the USSR. which in their makeup. accuracy
and time of dissemination must correspond to different requirements of the
national economy.

A representative of the Central Scientific Research Institute of Construc-
tion Designs of the USSR GOSSTROY A. A. Bat'. in a report entitled "Re-
quirements for Climatic Data for Supporting Construction Designs." report-

ed on the leading requirements for climatic information on snow end wind
oads.

The chief engineer of the Main Scientific Research Project of the USSR
Power Ministry L. I. Kudoyarov outlined the requirements on climatic data
{or the planning of power structures and enterprises (including the energy

resources of the sun). noting the need for preparing the complex character-
istica of climate.

N. H. Chernavskaya (Central Scientific Research and Planning Institute of
City Construction) formulated requirements on the content and form of rep-
resentation of climatic date for planning the built-up areas of cities and
populated places.

H. V. Obolenskiy, representing the Institute of Engineering Physics at the
conference, reported on the requirements on computed climatic parameters
used in architectural-construction planning.

A series of proposals on the development of the nomenclature of climatic in-
dices for the classification of dwellings was expressed by the chairman of
the Central Scientific Research and Planning Institute of Standard and Ex-
perimental Planning of Dwellings. V. K. Litskevich.

The scientific basis for creating a specialized medical-meteorological in-
formation and forecasting system was presented in the proposals of V. P.
0vchnrovn. representing the Central Scientific Research Institute of Cur-
ortology and Physical Therapy.

D. I. Shashho (State Scientific Research Institute of Land Resources) dealt
with the problems involved in agrometeorological support of development of
work on the problem of use of land resources.

Ye. P. Nikiforov told of investigations of glaze and glaze-wind loads on

electric lines, which are carried out at the All-Union Scientific Research
Institute of Electric Power.

The conference make known certain successes in the development of research
in the field of applied climatology and the introduction of the results of
these investigations in the practice of construction designing, long-term

planning and also in the development of measures for safeguarding the en-

vironment against contamination. However, it was noted that presently

169

available cliaatic intonation does not fully correspond to the imposed re-
quirements. Some types of observations have not been developed: UV radiation.
vertical distribution of individual meteorological elements in the lower
part of the boundary layer. heat balance components under urban conditions.

The Lilowing do not meet the practical requirements of accuracy in measuring
some meteorological elements: glaze-rimc deposits. wind speed.

No systea has been fully developed for the transmission of climatic inform-
ation plotted on a technical carrier to users.

In order to improve the servicing of the national economy with climatic in-
formation the conference called upon the 088% State Committee on Hydrometeor-
ology and mvironmental Monitoring with the following requests:

-- in the plan of scientific research work of the State Oouittce on Hydro-
meteorology. make provision for carrying out investigations for improving
existing and developing new methods for computing climatic parameters for
construction planning when there is an inadequacy or absence of observations.
including methods for computing dangerous and especially dangerous meteor-
ological phenomena which rarely recur:

- take measures for increasing the accuracy in measuring glaze and rims de-
posits and wind velocity:

— in the plane for development of the meteorological network, make provis-
ion for the organisation of observations of UV radiation. especially in re-
gions of new industrial construction and the building up of new cities.

The conference also called on the USSR Gosstroy to examine the problem

of improving the system for the development and refinement of standard
docuents containing climatic characteristics and include work on refin-

ing requirements on climatic information and improving existing methods

for computing climatic parameters in construction planning in the scientific
research institutes of the interested ministries and departments.

the brief tine elapsing since the discovery of large annular oceanic cur-
rents the number of such systens which have becoee known to science in the
northeastern part of the Atlantic Ocean has exceeded ten. The basis for
their existence is the Gulf Streee. which in passing by Cape Ilatteras
(United States). is deflected free the shores of North America and begins
to neander. that is. for! looplika curvatures.

Some of these "loops" are detached fron the min channel of the Gulf Stream
and hecoee independent annular currents. The velocity of water novenent in
then attains high values. in individual cases up to b Ina/hour. The disaster
of such rings is 150-300 la. “the water sessee occupied by then extend el-
eost to the ocean floor, here having a depth of about 2.500-3.500 s.

It has now been established that the ”rings.” separating from the Gulf
Stress fro- its southern side. differ from the surrounding warn waters of
the Sargasso Sea in that at their center there is a nucleus with a rela-
tively low teqerature. 0n the other hand, those same "rings" which are
separated from the northern side of the Gulf Stream carry warn "nuclei"
at their center.

An annular current. having a warn "nucleus," is usually displaced in a HS"
direct ion with a velocity up to 5 lot/day. The ”lifetiee" of such an individ-

biological conunitiee in the annular currents are extremely unusual in
comparison with the remaining regions of the ocean.

The circa-polar current. moving around the Antarctic continent, also, it
was found, generates annular cold independent systems. However, evidently,
their dimensions and velocity are smaller than those observed near the

Gulf Stream. For example. the annular current discovered to the south of
Cape Horn has a diameter a little more than 100 km and a velocity of rota-
tional motion of about 1.1 its/hour. Specialists are postulating that thie

is associated with the greater velocity of the Gulf Stream itself in compar-
ison with the Circmpolar Current.

1he study of annular currents. obviously characteristic of all regions of
the world ocean where powerful flows of water masses are present. is of
great theoretical and practical importance.

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON HIKHAIL ANDREYEVICH VELIKANOV (1879-1966)
Moscow HBTEOROLOGIYA I GIDROLOGIYA in Russian No 1, Jan 1979 pp 126-128

[Article by Ye. G. Pepov]

[Text] This year marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of the oututand-

ing scientist Mikhail Andreyevich Veliksnov, one of the founders of Saviet
hydrology.

 

The name of Professor Veliksnov stands in the ranks of the leading hydrol-
ngists of the world and is inseparably associated with the forming and
developing of hydrology of the land as one of the geographical-geophys-
ical sciences, destined not only for learning the general laws of the ex-
istence, distribution, circulation and regime of different foras of natur-
al waters of the land, but also to solve many vitally important engineer-
ing and national economic problems relating to evaluation and use of water
resources, hydraulic construction. irrigation, water transportation and pro-
tection against dangerous vster phenonens. Five editions of his book
GIDRDLOGIYA SUSHI (Hydrology of the Land) (1925, 1932, 1937, 1968 and
1965) were a fundamental contribution to a systematizing of knowledge

and scientific methods in hydrology. These books were used for many years
in teaching and learning in Soviet hydrology.

A brilliant.theoretician and lecturer. Mikhail Andreyevich Velikanov node

n aajor contribution to [emulation of a series of very important prob-
lens in hydrology and the developaent of its individual branches. his in-
vestigations were characterized by a combination of a profound physical an-
alysis of conplex natural processes and their mathematical description with
the execution of laboratory experiments. with the ispleaentation of the
necessary field observations and experinental work. His range of scientific
interests was also extreaely broad: froa the problem involved in the con-
tinental cycling of moisture and the water balance within the liaits of a
basin to the dynaaics of channel flows; from the laws of formation of high-
water runoff to channel processes and the theory of movement of sediaents
in rivers. A recognition of the great scientific services of Mikhail An-
dreyevich Velikanov was his election as a Corresponding Hember USSR Acad-

esy of Sciences and award of the honorary title of ”Heritorious worker in
Science and Technology RSFSR."

:likhoil Andreyevich Veliksnov was born on 22 January 1879 in Kaaan', the
son of an engineer. lie studied there in the gymaaiu. Upon graduation he
entered the Institute of Transportation Engineers in Peterburg. from which
he graduated in 1903. lie enters. therefore. into the ranks of those Russian
engineers (V. c. Glushkov, N. H. Dolgov, Ye. V. Blitnyak. D. 1. Kochergin.
N. S. belysvskiy, V. N. lpkhtin and others). who, devoting themselves to
the study of rivers and their regimes. processes of the formation of sur-
face runoff and channel processes, laid the basis for a relatively young
science ~- hydrology of the land.

The work activity of h. A. Velikanov after graduation from the institute
began in Siberia. where over a period of alnost 10 years (from 1903 to
1912) he made studies of Siberian rivers and devoted half this tine to a
study of the Yenisey. During the period 1913-1916 he carried out hydrogrsph-
ic investigations of the Severnaya Dvina. Sukhona, Zapadnyy Bug. Berezins
and Volga. continuing to study the laws of channel processes and the for-
nation of channels in direct relationship to the dynamics of water flows.
In 1917 he began his teaching activity at higher educational institutes.
First this was at the Tank Technological Institute, and in 1920. at Omsk,
at the Siberian Agricultural Institute. here he was named a professor and
was approved for that title.

In 1921 H. A. Velikanov moved to Moscow. where he worked in the comma and
in the Cauncil of the higher Technical Conittee of the People's Conissar-

lat oi’ Transportation and also presented lectures on hydraulics and hydrol-
ngy at the Moscow Land Surveying Institute (1921) and at the Moscow Higher

Technical School (1922-1929). Between 1930 and 1941 he headed the Departaent
of llydrology of the Land at the Moscow Hydrometeow-‘ugical Institute. For
"any years )1. A. Velikanov worked at the Power Inst. cute USSR Academy of
Sciences. There he created (1935) a laboratory of physical hydrodynamics

and headed it. During the post-war years he reorganized this laboratory

into a laboratory for the study of channel processes. Continuing his teach-
ing activity, liikhail Andreyevich in 1965 organized the training of special-
istc in the physics of channel flows at Moscow State University.

The multisided scientific activity of Hikail Andreyevich Velikanov was
closely related to the State llydroIOgical Institute and other institutes
of the llydrometeorological Service. lie was an active participant in the
first two hydrological congresses held by the State hydrological Institute
in 1926 and 1928. His ideas and points of view on the ways for development
of hydrology and methods for studying the processes of formation of runoff

meteorological observations, in creating rmoff stations as field experi-
mental bases for study of the physical laws controlling hydrological pro-
cesses under the conditions of a specific physiographic environment. Being
a scientist of the theoretical-experimental school, Velikanov insisted on
the need for ”transforming hydrology from a descriptive into a physical
ul'lvm‘v, otherwise, a part of geophysics." emphasizing the danger of exces-
sivc attention as a strictly geographical science or any strictly statis-
tical direction in the development of hydrology. llis theoretical studies
on the problems of formation of high-water runoff. the dynamics of channel
flows and the movement of sediments indicated the fertility of his ideas
and their practical significance became more obvious with the appearance
of electronic computers. making it possible to realize many of those theor-
etical proposals which up to that time seemed virtually iwossible. Over a
period of a number of years during the post-war period H. A. Velikanov
worked in a second position at the Central Institute of Forecasts, being
engaged in the training of graduate students and being an active member
of the Scientific Council of this institute. Here. in particular, he was
engaged in solution of the important hydrodynamic problem of computing
unsteady movement of water under conditions of mutual backing up of waters
when two watercourses come together.

The multisided scientific heritage of ii. A. Velikanov is very great. It is
surprising in the breadth and depth of his understanding of natural pro-
cesses, in the clarity of his formulation of fundamental problems in the
developocnt of hydrology, and his uncompromising evaluations of inadequate-
ly correct approaches to solution of complex problems and attempts ore-
sentcd to justify them with use of inadequate initial data. in a brief
Journal article there is no possibility of examining the significance of
even the most important studies of H. A. Velikanov. Therefore, we will lim-
it ourselves only to the most general consents.

in addition to the already mentioned five editions of the book GIDROIDGIYA
SUSHI, serving as a study aid for many generations of students. there are
other books by H. A. Velihanov which enjoy wide fame: VODNYY BALANS SUSHI

Despite all the diversity of the contribution of H. A. Velikanov to the de-
velop-ant of hydrology of the land, the principal field of his scientific
interests nust nevertheless be considered the problem of the dynamics of
channel flows, channel processes and the movement of sediments. his first
studies (1911-1913) were devoted to these matters. He also devoted laboratory
experiments to study of the turbulent structure of channel flow at the Tomi:
Technological Institute. later at the Kuchinskaya hydrological Station. and
still later in the Camel Processes Laboratory USSR Academy of Sciences.
These matters occupied him to the last days of his life. his published works
enumerated above made a fundamental contribution to science. In particular,
we should mntion H. A. Velikanov's gravitational theory of the motion of
suspended alluviu, which, from the point of view of physical validation,
differs advantageously from the siwler (and up to now, aore attractive)
diffusion theory, which, however, as noted by Mikhail Andreyevich, is correct
for the transport of a ”weightless substance" and in principle is applicable
only for extremely light suspended aaterial. The debatable problems assoc-
iated with evaluation of these two theories were broadly discussed at one
tine on the pages of IZVES‘I'IYA WI "Am: 8588 (News of the USSR Academy
of Sciences)(l952). It can only be regretted that even now, with the avail-
ability of electronic comuters. the gravitational theory of motion of sus-
pended sedinents nevertheless has not received suitable approbation

and developmnt. He also note Velikanov's proposal of hydromorphological
dependences which recently have cone into use in solving the problea of
scale relationships in hydraulic aodeling.

Hith respect to the studies of H. A. Velikanov on the theory of formation
of shower- or snow~induced high waters, we note that the equation derived

H. A. Velikanov was an opponent of the special segregation of statistical

Imethods in hydrology. but at the same tine he repeatedly eaphasired the
major role of statistics in the solution of many problem in hydrology. In
particular, he examined such problem as the use of "composition” methods

in establishing the distribution functions of peak high-Hater discharges,
the stochastic structure of hydrological forecasting and allowance for its
errors. One of the last of his studies was. as already noted. a book devot-
ed to measure-en: errors and empirical dependences. It would be useful to
republish this book.

Siaultaneously with the great scientific and pedagogic work of K. A. Vell-
kanov, as a consultant and expert he participated in the creation in our
country of large water neaagesent systems, hydroelectric power, navigation
and irrigation structures.

Soviet hydrologists honor the Beauty of Mikhail Andreyevich Veliksnov. They
now lake extensive use of his ideas and studies in their investigations for

the further develop-eat of hydrology and in solving its practical problees
and will long continue to do so.

[Article by s group of comrades]

[Text] Candidate of Geographical Sciences Hileyko Georgiy Nikitich. a sen-
ior specialist at the USSR Rydrouetsorological Center. died prematurely on
6 September 1978.

 

Georgiy Nikitich became associated with the Division of Marine Hydrological
Forecasts on the eve of its creation. In 1966, after graduating from the
llydroueteorological Institute, he was sent to the Central Institute of Fore-
casts, where he worked to his last day.

During his first years of work at the institute G. N. Kileyko headed a sec-
tion on Iarine information. invested much energy and all his knowledge in
order to improve the servicing of national economic organizations

with narino forecasts. repeatedly participating in both organizing and
carrying out marine expeditions and ice aerial reconnaissance. He worked
for nany years in the field of counting and predicting the distribution

of water teaperature and the position of the ice edge in the oceans and
8.0.0

The scheee which he developed for predicting water temperature is used in
the routine practice of the USSR Hydro-ateorological Center and a nulber
of Adeinistrations of the Hydroeeteorologicsl Service. Recently G. N. Hil-
eyko developed a nethod for computing convective heat transfer free the

ocean into the atmosphere; it is used for the purpose of numerical long-
range weather forecasting.

‘9
c. N. Hileyko was one of the authors of a code for shore hydroeeteorolog-
icel observations at sea stations and posts (KN-02. and also the codes KN-
05 and RIB-06) and manuals on the use of aerial methods in oceanography. In
1977 he published an atlas of the lean long-tern characteristics of the
teeperature regime of waters in the North Atlantic. The director of this
work was 6. N. Hileyko. He was one of the initiators in organizing the

guidance of ships on the most advantageous navigation routes in the seas
and oceans.

Georgiy Nikitich Mileyko combined his any years of experience in the field
of marine forecasts and research work with routine servicing, sethodolog-
ical work and the teaching of young specialists in the division. He carried
out all work with great care and on tine. He taught these things to youth.
The memory of Georgiy Nikitich Mileyko will forever remain in our hearts.
