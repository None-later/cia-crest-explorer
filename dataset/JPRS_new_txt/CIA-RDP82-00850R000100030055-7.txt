ACTIVITIES IN NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE REPORTED
Duesseldorf ATOHHIRISCHAFT-AIOMTECHNIK in German Feb 79 pp 76-82
[Article by G. Lurf. Hanan: "French Activities in Fuel Cycle“]

[Text] The comprehensive French nuclear energy program
calla for a fuel cycle industry which can meet require-
ments in all phases of supply and waste removal. This
applies not only to light-water reactors but also. in a
preparatory manner, to sodium breeders which in France
are already a firm part of medium-range planning.
Natural uranium supply, conversion. enrichment, and
reprocessing were or are being developed with the goal
of securing not only domestic needs but also being

able to make offers on the world market. The develop-
ment stages attained and the contractual ties reveal
already today that France is pursuing this objective
through close partnership between government and industry.

1. Introduction

The start of technical development in nuclear fuel supply in France goes
back about 30 years. High priority was assigned to a program which was
supposed to make France independent in all component sectors of the fuel
cycle. The organization of this activity provided that all research and
development work was to be done by the CEA (French Atomic Energy Cosmussion).
After most of these activities-which, by the end of the sixties. had been
geared toward the gas-graphite reactor line and since then to the light-
water reactors and sodium breedera--had reached the stage of industrial
maturity. the French government in 1975 authorized the CEA to establish a
company of its own to handle the entire fuel cycle. This company. called
Cogema (General Nuclear Materials Company) then was formally founded
in January 1976 as a corporation [a company with limited liability]. It

is a loo-percent affiliate of the CEA and its competence today already
extends over 80 percent of the entire sales volume in the field of the fuel
cycle in France. Parallel to that. private companies are active mostly in
the natural uranium sector and in fuel element production. The sales

2. Natural Uranium

France'e extractable natural uranium depoaite have been eetilated at a
total of 95.900 t U. Thie can be broken down ae follova: proven reaervee
of 37.000 t U which can be extracted at a coat of up to sao/kg U and
eatinated additional reaourcea of 24.100 t U in the ease coat category.

In the 380-130Ikg U coat category, the proven reaervee have been reported
at 16,800 [19 and the additional eeti-ated reeervea have been given at
20,000 t U .

as well as the Dong-Trieu French Real Estate and Mining Company. controlled
by Empsin-Schneider. and the Pensrroya and Mokte firms which belong to the
Imetel group; the latter two coapsniee pursue their uranium interests vie
a Joint partnership in CFMU (French Uranium Mineral Company) in which
Cogema however is also a partner. SMUC (Center Uranium Mines Company). in
which Cage-a. CFMU. and, indirectly, Imetal share to the extent of 33-1/3
percent, each, operates the Le Besee uranium mine; SCUMRA (Central Uranium
and Radioactive Minerals and Metals Company). a loo-percent affiliate of
Minatoma. is mining the deposit in St. Pierre. in the Central Massif. A
new mine is scheduled to go into production at Mailhac in 1979. The
Dong-Trieu French Real Estate and Mining Company is planning on an initial

output capacity of 230 t U/a [tons of uranium per year]. which is to be
expanded to 500 t U/a by the early eighties.

Until Cogema was founded early in 1976. Uranex was France's central natural
uranium purchasing organization. Parallel to the transfer of all natural
uraniue activities of the can to Cogema, PUK and CF? coabined their share-
holdings in this field in the newly-founded Hinatoma. This separation was
made final early in 1978 when Hinatome ceded to Cogsma its shares in the
holding firm of SH?H (Pechiney kuta Mining Company) which, in turn. is

a partner in Uranex. It was agreed on that occasion that Uranex uranium
delivery contracts would be filled by Cogeea and that Hinatome would supply
Cogena with certain quantities of uranium for this purpose.

In addition to operation: in their own home country. French firms are also
involved in uranium production in Niger. Gabon. Central Africa. Namibia.
and Canada. Moreover. there are numerous partnerships in exploration
companies in the above-mentioned countries which are not shown in the
illustration. Cogena by the way is involved in uranium exploration in
Canada, Australia. and the United States via loo-percent affiliates.

Overall, a total of more than 27.000 t U has been mined so far in France;
since 1972 it has been possible to increase the output slightly each year
(Table 1). Out of 1977 uranium production, 1.700 t U cone from the mines
controlled by Cogegs. The other, private uranium producers mined 600 t U
in France in 1977 .

The future development of uranium production in France as well as the
possible uranium imports into France were compiled in Figure 3. Here of
course in each case we considered only those uranium mines which are already
in production or where we can expect production to be started (Table 2).

It is therefore probable that the output will. after 1984, increase to a
greater extent than illustrated in Figure 3. Along with the output from
French mines (curve 1), we also considered here the production in keeping
with the French shares in foreign mines in Niger. Gabon. Namibia. and
Canada (curve 2). France furthermore in the past also marketed the
production shares of the national government partnerships in mines in Niger
and Gabon.

Nining Company]. of Niger, which began experimental operation in the Autumn
of 1978. But if we start with the assumption that France, in the case of

the other projects, in the future likewise. will get the share of the govern-
ment-owned fires of Gabon and Niger. then France. over the next several years.
would have available the natural uranium quantity illustrated in curve 3.

Of that amount, of course. one would have to deduct the requirements for
military purposes and research as well as the export obligations undertaken
up to the year 1971.. After that. France did not sign any new export con-
tracts. The scope of the delivery contracts with supply enterprises in
Belgium. the FRO. Holland, Japan, and Iran. as well as Nestinghouss—agreed
upon regarding the sale of a part of the share of Hestinghouse in Framstome-
can be estimated at a total of 19,000 t U for the period of 1978-1987.

Figure lo shows that, even after deduction of these delivery obligations and
the silitary requirements. France will have enough uranium available during
the coming years in order to meet the natural uranium requirement from existing
enrichment contracts and for the supply of the natural uranium reactors—
provided that France also gets shares from the uranium output coming from
the government-owned firms in Gabon and Niger onthe basis of partnership
terms. After 1983 however, under the assumptions made here, the output

will be so great that France will be able to meet its requirements also
without these government shares. Not considering existing stockpiles in
France, we therefore will have a cumulative natural uranium surplus of

about 50,000 t U by 1990 (Figure 5). If additional plants should start
production during that period of time, then the stockpile would go up
accordingly or more uranium would be available for export to other countries.

3. Conversion

The conversion of uranium concentrate into uraniun hexafluoride (UF6) is
being handled in France by the Comurhex firm. The partners in Comurhex
are: Pechiney (512), Cogema (392). and Mokta (102).

Comurhex has two plants available for conversion: uranium tetrsfluoride
(UFg) is produced in the Malvesi plant. A part of that is converted at
Halvesi into uranium metal which is used in gas-graphite reactors. The
overwhelming portion of UP however is transported to the second plant in
Fierrelatte and is converted into UF6 there.

The Pierrelatte plant presently has a capacity of 10,000 t U/a. Although
only a part of that capacity is needed for French requirements, the plant

has a full workload ahead of it through conversion orders from foreign
customers until 1980. Flans are to expand the capacity to 12.000 t U/a

in 1980. An expansion of the capacity to a total of 15.000 t U/a is possible
at the current site. A further capacity increase can be achieved only by
building a new plant. The development in worldwide requirements would

lead us to expect the construction of an additional plant only during the
second half of the eighties.

Table 3 shows that France presently has 22.4 percent of the Western world's
conversion capacity.

Io. Enrichment

The Pierrelstts plant, which works according to the gas diffusion metuod,
was erected for military purposes during the middle of the sixties and
accordingly is designed for high degrees of enrichment. The plant‘s
capacity has been estimated at about 600-600 t UTA/a [tons of uranium
conversion work per year].

In October 1973. EURODIF [European Diffusion Agency] was established as
an international company to erect a big diffusion plant (for shareholding
terms, see Figure 6).

 

Figure 6. Enrichment Industry Shareholding Conditions (Figures in Percent).
Key: AGIP--National Italian Oil Company; CNEN-[Italian] National Nuclear
Energy Comndssion; SOBEN-Belgisn Nuclear Company [7]; COREDIP-Csseoue
Diffusion-Factory Construction Company; [Other abbreviations unknown].

The plant built in Tricastin. France. by BURODIF (Figure 7 [not requested]).
is to start operations with an output of 2.600 t UTA/a in 1979 and is
presumably to attain a full capacity of 10,800 t UTA/a in 1982. In the
vicinity of the enrichment plant. EDP [French Electric Power Company] will
be building four pressurized-water reactors with 925 HTU, each (Tricastin
1-4), which are to be placed in operation one after the other. starting in
1979. For the power supply going to the energy-intensive diffusion plant,
the output of about three out of the four reactors will be needed when the
enrichment plant is ready in its final form.

The planned capacity of the EURODIF plant will be used as follows: a group
of Japanese electric power supply enterprises has made total purchases of
10,000 t UTA [uranium separation work]. The deliveries are to be made
between 1980 an 1990. An enrichment contract covering a total of about

700 .' UTA was signed for the Swiss nuclear powerplant at Kaiseraugat. with
deliveries to be made between 1.981 and 1989. There is furthermore a contract
with M! (Rhine-Heatphalinn Electricity works. inc.) on the delivery of about
700 t UTA. starting in 1983. The entire renaining separation work will be
taken by 30110an partners in accordance with the particular capital shares.

In spite of the delays in the reactor construction programs of their countries.
the EURODIP partners intend to build a second. big European diffusion plant
under the new COREDIF (for shareholding conditions. see Figure 6). The

exact location of the site has not yet been picked.

According to official plans, the first 008301? phase. with a capacity of about
2.500 t UTA/a. is to be completed roughly in 1986; the output is to be
expanded to about 10,000 t UTA/a later. In view of the worldwide surplus
capacity in enrichment during the eighties. it scene iuprobable that the
project will be coapleted by the indicated deadline. The capacity of the
consort plant therefore was not included in the study of the supply of

France and the EURODIF countries with separation work (Figures 8-11).

France is also planning the construction of s denonstration plant which
is to work according to the method of "French Che-ical Uranium Enrichment
Process." The plant is to have the capacity of about 50-100 t UTA/a and
according to can announcements. it is to go into operation possibly even
before 1985. Looking at the situation free today. it is expected that
the chemical exchange method will be used for enrichment in large-scale
industrial operations roughly around 1990.

Figure 0. illustrates France's supply with separation work for the period

of 1978-1990. as covered by this study. The actual separation work require-
sent--which was determined on the basis of the specific consumption of the
reactors and the installed nuclear powerplent capacity-~is conpsred here

to the separation work delivery quantities already contracted for and to

the acceptance obligations toward EURODIF. In computing the separation work
requirement in Figures 8-11. we started with a rails-Assay of 0.2 percent
0-235.

From the difference between curves (1) and (2), in figure 8. we get the
surplus or the uncovered requirement for separation work which is reproduced
in figure 9 and which was illustrated both annually (left-hand bar) and
cunulstively (right-hand bar). In the cumulative values. we considered

an existing stockpile of about 1.000 t UTA. including these supplies. we
get, for France. during the first half of the eighties. a steadily rising
surplus of enriched uraniua with a separation work content of 8.500 t UTA

in 1985 which however. under the assumptions made here. that is to say.

that France will take only the share corresponding to its participation in
tunonu. will again dwindle entirely during the second half of the eighties.
But this eases unrealistic if we look at the overall situation such as it
involves 80300117.

In Figure 10. we have illustrated, in sumrized fashion. the supply with
separation work for the countries which participate in the 808001? plant.
that is, France. Belgius, Iran. Italy, and Spain. The actual separation
work requiresentnwhlch was detersined on the basis of the powerplnnt
capacities of those countries as listed in Table Ira-is coepsred here to

the contractually stipulated ship-ants of separation work and the acceptance
obligations of the BURODIP countries.

Free the difference between curves (1) and (2) in Figure 10 we can calculate
the existing surplus or uncovered requirssent for separation work which was
plotted in Pigure ll and which was illustrated annually (left-hand bar) and
cuulatiwely (right-hand bar). The cusulative values do not contain any
existing supplies of separation work. Under that assusption, we get—for
the WM? countries-n surplus of enriched uraniu. which will constantly
increase until late into tho eighties. with a maxi-us separation work content
of 47,000 t UTA in 1989.

That of course can happen only if the participating countries abide by their
delivery obligations for feed ureniun—sonething which eust be doubted at
this tine. EURODIF see-s to be thinking at this tine in tensor finding a
way out of this situation.

The fuel elseents for the m line. on which the French nuclear progran is
based. are being eanufsctured by the rare (French-Belgian Fuel Fabrication
Coepany). The Trench-Belgian fuel elenent producer--in who- EUROPUEL parti-
cipates with 80 percent, while the Belgian mu (Nuclear Hetellurgy and Hachine-
Building Company) shares with 16 percent and Hestinghouae with '0 percent
(Figure lZ)-operates the plant in Dessel. belgiula. as well as the production
plants in Rosana. France. which it had taken over from men (Conany for

the Study and Henufacture of Atonic Fuel) and at whose site it is presently
erecting a cowletely new fabrication plant.

In addition to PBPC. CIRCA. founded in 1957. in which Creusot-loire and
PUK share in equel parts. turns out fuel eleeents for various reactor
types but especially for gas-graphite reactors and research reactors.

6. Reprocessing

CEA in 1958 sterted operating the UPI (Irradiated Fuels Reprocessing and
Plutoniun Extraction Plant) in Nercoule; in 1966 it began to operate plant
UPZ at Cape la hegue (Figure 13 [not requestedl). Both plants were designed
with a capacity of about 800 t U/a. each. for the purpose of processing
netallic fuels of the Hegnox reactor line. The plants work according to

the PUREX method end so far have processed nore than 10,000 t U. After the
French government in 1970 hsd decided to introduce the LHR line. plant

UPZ in Cape la aegue was expanded by the addition of a heed-end for oxide
fuels (HAO-highly radioactive oxide workshop). which is designed for an
output volune of 600 t "In and which was conpleted in 1976.

Both plants have been operated by Cogene, the can sffiliate since 1976.

DEVELOPMENT OF ARIANE PROPULSION SYSTEMS DETAILED
Paris L'ABRONAUTIQUE ET L'ASTRONOAUTIQUE in French 1978-6 pp 69-66
[Article by J. P. Livi and D. Thevenot]

[Text] This article follows one by Mr Thevenot that appeared in No 59, an
Ariana special (1976-6).

After some review. we shall try to present the development status of these
systems and the framework within which this development is taking place.

Background

The Ariane propulsion systems using storable propellants are the refinement
of the work undertaken for more than 25 years by the Vernon LRBA [abbrevia-
tion not identified) and taken up again by the SE? [abbreviation not identi-
fied] at that same center. This work had begun with Veronique. and was
continued with Vesta, Vexin. Coralie [2nd stage Europa I and II). and L 17
(let stage of Diamant B).

Propulsion was provided in all these systems by engines supplied with
propellants froa tanks pressurized by scans of a gas generator.

In order to increase the performance of the propellants, it was then de-
cided to develop an engine whose combustion chamber would be supplied with
fuel by a turbopump. That gave rise to the first Viking engine with a
thrust of 60 tons. which was first tested in June 1969.

On the basis of this component. various propulsion system configurations
were studied within the framework of the Europe III-B two-stage heavy
launch vehicle project having a first stage using storable propellants
(UDHH-N204) and a second stage using cryogenic propellants (Hz-02).

As far as the first stage is concerned:

-120 tons of fuel. 5 motors with 60 tons of thrust.

-l20 tons of fuel. 6 motors with 55 tons of thrust.

17
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

-150 tons of fuel. 4 notors with 60 tons of thrust.

So very naturally at the tine the Europa 111-8 tests were stopped (1972)
and work was begun on L 111 S. which was later to becone Ariana. the basic
part was retained. while the heavy launch vehicle becsne a third stage.

-First stage. 160 tons of fuel. 4 Viking 1! engines with a thrust of 60
tons each on the ground (68 tons in a vacuulb.

-8econd stage. 33 tons of fuel, 1 Viking IV engine with s unit thrust of
72 tons. derived fro. the Viking 11 by adaptation the diffuser nozzle to

space flight conditions.

Since 1973. the year of tne decision to get the Ariene progrsn underway.

6 years after the first tests of the prototype enter with a thrust of 40

tone. the develop-ant has taken place in the 60-ton thrust configuration.
12-13-73. First test of the Viking 11 engine (60 tons).

6-23-76. First test of the Viking 111 engine (ground version of the Viking
IV engine).

12-16-76. First test of the Viking 1V engine in s vacuun.

11-17-76. Pirst propulsion bay test of the Drakkar propulsion system with
heavy tanks.

10-19-76. First group test of the L 33 propulsion systen with heavy tanks.
12-13-76. First test of flight version of the Drakkar propulsion systen.
1-26-78. Piret test of flight version of the L 33 propulsion systen.

The evaluation tests are to begin for the two propulsion systems in late
78 and early 79.

DESCRIPTIO“
The DRAXKAR (flow diagram, figure 1)

The propulsion system of the first stage is conposed of the following nain
conponents:

The fuel tanks are designed for the storage of 165 tons of fuel. The UDHH
and N204 tanks have the sane capacities (3.80 n in dianeter) and are struc-
turally independent. They also serve as a thrust transnission structure.
being inter-connected by an inter-tank skirt.

POI! OWYCTAL "RF ONLY

The propulsion bay is composed of:

«the engine mounting, a cylindrical structure transmitting the thrust to
the tanks on which the following are mounted:

«four Viking V engines equipped with a connectron with 1 degree of freedom
to permit roll. yaw. and pitch control by means of one servo actuator per
engine, equipped also with main fuel and water supply valves. The Viking V
is a curved diffuser nozzle version of the Viking ll whose nozzle is conical.

«The tank pressurization system using hot gases (1000'0) taken from the
generators. supplying the turbo-pumps after cooling by water injection.

«A toric tank containing the water used for the cooling of the generator
and pressurization gases.

«A control mit which distributes a reference pressure or pilot pressure
for the engine regulation function. This pressure also serves to actuate
the engine supply valves (um. N204. H20).

«A control unit for the P000 correction systems.

«The filling and emptying components ensure fuel and fluid linkages between
the ground installations and the propulsion system. These components are

situated at the base of the system on a heat shield which blocks the space
inside the engine mounting.

«The various fuel and fluid circuits.
The I. 33 (flow diagram. figure 2)

The propulsion system of the second stage is composed of the following
principal components:

The fuel tanks for the storage of 310 tons of fuel. The tanks are of the
same capacity. but unlike those of the first stage, they are dependent from
the structural standpoint since they have a co-on bottom.

They have a diameter of 2.60 m, and are made of light alloy (AZ 56). This
difference in material with respect to the Drakkar causes an important dif-
ference from the pressurization standpoint and led to a pressurization sys-
tem using cold gases (helium at ambient temperature) as opposed to hot
gases.

The propulsion bay is composed of:

«a conical engine mounting (with cylindrical skirt) on which the following
are mounted:

«the Viking IV engine, using a connection with 2 degrees of freedom to
permit yaw-pitch control by means of two servo actuators. The engine is
likewise equipped with its main valves.

produced by SNIAS.

SNIAS produces the fuel tanks end integrates the letter in the propulsion
bay to form a propulsion systea. This system is then delivered to 82?.
which arranges testing on the PF 20 test stand at Vernon.

The L 33

88? produces the various materials other than structural materials.

SNIAS has the following constructed:

--tho fuel tanks. by Bernie: (Ger-any)

--the structures (engine mounting. forwerd shirt) by Brno. as well as the
water tank (subcontracted for Brno by MD!) (Germany).

SNIAS subcontracts the overall integration to Brno. The propulsion cysts-s
thus for-ed are sent to SE? for testing. The conducting of the tests is
subcontracted to the DFVLR (Germany). the definition and exploitation of
the results of the tests being done by 53?.

ORGANIZATION AND DEVELOPHBhT PRO“ SUBSYSTEHS STANDPOINT

--The design and development of the materiels end subsystess for which 82?
is responsible are divided into:

--SBP's own development and fabrication.
--developmsnt and fabrication subcontracted to European cooperators.

H2.l test on 3-31-78 at the nominal duration of 138 seconds, followed by
a second firing with the same propulsion system.

M2.2 of short duration, 17 seconds. for a special purpose.
The third propulsion system H3 will be tested in the second half of August.

In the first two systems tested there was no damage to the nozzle throats
of the engines. and this result confirms those obtained in the C tests.

ASSEMBLY AND CONTROL
At Vernon the assembly shops are able to install the following components:

-engines;

-hot gas pressurization systems;

--cold gas pressurization systems;

-vslves and components of the filling and draining systems;
-control groups;

—-POGO control units.

These materials are either sent to BRNO (Bremen) for integration into the
propulsion system with the technical assistance of the SEP, for the L 33,
or integrated at the Drekkar propulsion bay level in a shop specially
fitted out for that purpose and including. in addition to the specific
installations of the 88, three integration docks and one dock for disas-
aembly after firing.

All of these materials (components or propulsion bays) are undergoing the
set of controls and acceptance tests prior to delivery to ERNO or SRIAS
for purposes of integration at the propulsion system level.

Teams of mechanics are assigned to work on the materials being tested.
They are working in cooperation with the ERNO teams for the L 33 propulsion
systems.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE GUYANESB SPACE CENTER

Personnel who participated in the developaent of the propulsion systole
will he unborn of the teens preparing the launch vehicles in Guyana:

“from the controls and adjust-outs standpoint after erection:

—fron the standpoint of preparation for firing and precheckout operations
which will have been previously tested and evaluated at the tins of the
tests in Europe;

-fron the standpoint of exploitation of the flight tests.
CONCLUSION

Anyone reading this article has seen that. in spite of a najor technical
problen with the Drakker nozzle throats. the development of the Drskkar
propulsion systems is satisfactory; the general concept of these systems
was not inpugned, and the functional integration has given good results.

Since the throats prohlee has been clearly identified and technological
solutions are available. the correction should he lads without great
difficulties.

To be sure. iaprovemants still have to he ads in certain conponents to
ensure greater reliability:

But the experience gained since 1973 should make it possible to enter this
final phase of the evaluation of the propulsion systens and, finally.
flight, with confidence.

Part ‘No: Cryogenic Propulsion Systen ll 8
[Article by D. Thevenot)
BACKGROUND

Mr J. P. Livi's article in issue 109 devoted to Arisne (19710-6) gave the
background of cryogenic studies in France prior to the 31 July 1973 deci-

sion to go ahead with the Ariana program. Let us recall oriefly the Iain
landmarks:

“1962: studies to define an engine with 6 to 6 tons of thrust for the
2nd stage of the Dissent (an lo);

“1965: modification of the project to include a 3rd stage (project
Diogene);

“1968: 360 seconds of continuous operation with 6,000 daN of thrust;

--1969: studies to define an engine with 7.000 dsN of thrust (EH 7) for the
Europa III N project;

--l970: phase of defining the engine with 20,000 deN of thrust (H 20) for
the Europa III 3 project;

--l972: halting of Europa III B and resumption of “H 7 studies;

--l973: decision to begin the Ariana program leading to the first flight
test on 15 July 1979 and flight evaluation after the fourth flight in late
1980.

Since that date numerous important milestones have been passed:

--ll-7-75: 1st test of the complete engine in ground condition (Villaroche
horizontal test stand).

-9-22-76: lst test of the complete engine in ground condition (vertical
test stand PF 61 at Vernon).

--6-9-77: 1st altitude simulation test of the complete engine (vertical
test stand PF 61 at Vernon).

-b-13-77: is: cold test of the propulsion bay (test stand PF 42 at
Vernon).

-ll-24-77: 1st firing test of the propulsion bay.

--10-16-77: lst cold test of the propulsion systes (test bench PF 63
at Vernon).

--l-lO-78: 1st firing test of the propulsion system.

The coming months will see the end of the perfection of the propulsion
system and its evaluation in 1979.

DESCRIPTION

The propulsion system of the third stage of the Arisne launch vehicle
carries 8 tons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen in a tank with conmnn
intermediate bottom (developed by Air Liquide), supplying an HH 7 engine
with 6.000 daN of thrust. The fuel is routed to the engine through valves
and lines with blowers and joints making it possible to lock the engine
for yaw and pitch control.

The engine thrust is transmitted to the cylindrical collar of the tank by

a conical engine mounting supporting all the propulsion bsy components.
It also has a cylindrical part uhose bottom is integral with interstage

2/3 and the second stage after pyrotechnic cutoff at the time of separa-
tion.

The oxygen tank is pressurized by heliun stored at very low temperature
(100 K) and high pressure (200 bars) at the tins of liftoff; an initial
relief valve lowers the pressure to 23 bars. and after heating to 1‘0 K
a second relief valve adjusts the pressure in the tank to 2.11 bars; a
valve causes degseification to take place if the pressure is greater than
2. 9 bars.

The pressurization of the hydrogen tank is done by gaseous hydrogen taken
as it leaves the regeneration circuit of the engine combustion chenber
(38.5 bars and 100 K); a relief valve adjusts the pressure to 2.91 bars.

while a valve effects degeeificetion if the pressure is higher than 3.09
bars.

The helium serving to pressurize the oxygen tank. stored in a titanium
TA SE 8L1 sphere 660 II in disaster also has various other functions:

At its intermediate expansion level of 23 bars:

--It pernite scavenging of the injectors during the ignition and shut-down
phases:

--It provides energy to the control system for operating and pneunatic
valves after distribution by the electrovelves which receive orders from
the vehicle conputer;

-It regulates pressure in the hydrogen tank during the flight of the first
two stages;

--And after expansion again to l5 bare. it provides a reference pilot pres-
sure for regulation of the engine. and evacuetes the internal leakage of
the turbopunp while isolating the oxygen and hydrogen circuits.

The yew and pitch control is done by locking the engine (connected to the
mounting by a universal joint) due to the action of two actuators powered
by a hydraulic unit with an electric motor.

The roll control. as well as the attitude control after burn-out of the
engine. is effected by gaseous hydrogen ejection (taken from the tank
pressurization line) by means of two groups of three nozzles supplied by
pneumatic valves controlled by electrovalvss.

The hydrogen and oxygen valve panels permit filling and pressurization;
they are jettisoned in negative tine prior to liftoff. for the slowness
of the rotary novement of the area of the umbilical tower prevents their
overriding between the ignition of the engines of the Drakkar first stage
and liftoff.

The purge connectors are lighter links making it possible to salvage the
degesification; they are jettisoned in positive time after liftoff; in

to

case of aborted firing after jettisoning of the valve panels. they permit
drainage of the tanks using the purge circuits.

Finally let us mention the conditioning circuit which makes it possible to
fill with helium on the ground all spaces in which water. air. or nitrogen

would be undesirable due to mechanical (icing) or electrical (safety) con-
siderations.

DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSYSTEHS

As SE? subcontractors. various European manufacturers are developing vari-
ous subsystems:

--Measerschmidt-Bolkow-Blohm (PRO) is responsible for the combustion chamber
of the NM 7 engine and its diffuser nozzle. The evaluation tests were made
in Hay 1977; they demonstrated a specific impulse of 66k a. a key element in
the performance of the h 8 propulsion system. On the contrary the service
life is limited to 1.200 s on the averaga--a sufficient value for in-flight

firing. but below the specification that had been established for ground
teats.

-HBB is also developing the fuel supply valves. A new light alloy version
has made possible a gain in weight over the initial stainless steel version.

All specimens intended for the four technological flights are available
today.

--8ritish Aerospace Dynamics Group (6.8.) (formerly NSD, which became BADG)
is responsible for the pressure control components. The helium high pres-
sure ralief valves. for pressurization of the tanks (LOX and L82) and pilot

pressure for the engine. as well as the two valves of the tanks. were de—
signed from materials resulting from previous programs at HSD. The first
tests. and particularly the pressurization circuit tests conducted at
Vernon. showed that an improvement in the performance of those components
was necessary. A supplementary development program was set up in 1977.

To date the results seem satisfactory from the components standpoint; it
remains to be proven that the overall behavior, associating the components.
the lines. and the tanks (with gaseous volume changing during operation)

is satisfactory. even during ignition and burnout conditions. The evalua-

tion of these materials after modification will not be undertaken until
late 1978.

 

Figure 3. Pressure control components (BADC)

--BADC is also responsible for the electrovslve cases. Four cases contain
a total of 17 electrovelves. to which are added the six electrovalves of
the attitude and roll control system (or 23 electrovelves) with each pro-
pulsion system. The major difficulty to be resolved has been that of the
leak ratio. for the quantity of helium carried on board is likely to be
critical and its low temperature is hard on the electrovslves (220 K).

--Fokker (Netherlands) was awarded the engine mounting development contract
by SEP. This aeronautical type structure which serves to support all lines

and components of the propulsion system has required numerous changes in
order to arrive at a detailed definition of all interfaces. The evaluation
is taking place at the present time.

-SABCA (Belgium) is responsible for the development of the servo motors
hydraulic group assembly which permits yaw and pitch control. The evalua-

tion is in progress. Since a large number of characteristics of the servo
motors enter into the control system, the 83? has been forced to specify

their makeup in detail. Incidentally the SBP has participated in the
shield tests conducted on the "pilot model" ["maqustte de pilotsge") by
the SNIAS at Les Mureaux using a real engine mounting. a real servo motors
hydraulic group, and a mockup engine representing weight and inertia.

--Finally. Avica (6.3.) has developed the flexible links and connections
ncattsrsd through the various lines of the propulsion system.

-SEP, for its part, itself developed the rest of the components or sub-
assemblies; let us mention in particular:

--Ths attitude and roll control system. which was tested with gaseous
hydrogen at the Villaroche annex of 52?; the evaluation is being completed
at the present time.

~~Ihe valve panels, also tested at Villsroche. the final test phase of
which also uses the recovery system developed by Latecoere.

--The purge connectors. also tested at Villaroche; the belated decision
to develop them is the reason why the adjustment tests are not beginning
until now.

--The helium storage sphere. holding 151 liters at 200 bars and 100 K.

Made of TA 5! ELI titanium by the Bordeaux establishment of 52?. The
evaluation was made on four specimens which underwent fatigue. mechanical
and climatic environment. and breaking tests; the safety factor is 2.10.

behavior, and its performance, the 52? developed on test stand PF 61 an
altitude simulation test compartment permitting long-duration tests;

a vapor extractor provides the low pressure level required at the outlet
from the diffuser nozzle during starting; this negative pressure is then
maintained solely by the suction effect of the engine jet.

 

Figure 13. PF 41 test stand for testing the engine under
ground and simulated altitude conditions

Twenty-five tests totalling 1,300 seconds of operation have demonstrated
the engine's capacity for attaining the specified duration; the performance
measured at 6C kdaN of thrust involves 6&1 seconds of specific impulse.

The altitude simulation tests began in May 1977 and the evaluation is to
begin during the summer of 1978.

THE PROPULSION BAY TESTS

For precautionary reasons it was decided to conduct propulsion bay tests
prior to the propulsion system tests; it is. in fact, a question of propul-
sion system tests in which the light flight type tanks with cannon inter-
mediate bottom are replaced by independent, thick tanks, and greater vari-
ations in pressure are thus permitted. The PF 62 test stand was designed
at Vernon for that purpose, and the first test took place in April 1977.
Numerous difficulties were encountered in putting the test stand in opera-
tion and perfecting the procedures, and there were failures of certain
prototype materials. The defects were gradually corrected, and the first
firing test took place on 26 November 1977. In all. 16 tests were con-
ducted up until 23 February 1978, including three firing tests. The
nominal duration was attained and the test on the total exhaustion of the
oxygen was completed.

Valuable lessons were learned from this test series. and the results have
not yet been completely exploited. Experiments were run with numerous
cases of functioning and failure. and the procedures have been worked out.
A second propulsion bay is now at the stand, and the new tests will use
materials closer to the flight version as well as the control components;
the activation of the engine can then take place.

THE PROPULSION SYSTEM TESTS

The PF 63 test stand was created by SE? for the complete propulsion system
tests. It is connected to the sane central command post as test stands

PF bl and PF 62, end so it constitutes a multipurpose assembly. In particu-
lar it makes it possible to simulate altitude conditions at the outlets

from the nozzles of the attitude and roll control system. which operate on
depressurization of the tank during the ballistic phase preceding the in-
jection of the payload into orbit.

The testing of the first propulsion system began in October 1977, end

the first firing test took place on 10 January 1978. In sll, four cold
tests and two firing tests have taken place. making it possible to attain
the nominal duration. Thus the initial test of a cryogenic propulsion
system developed in Europe took place b 1/2 years after the program got
under way.

A second propulsion system is now on the stand; the testing of it will
make it possible to continue the development by introducing the new
standards for materials, the yaw and pitch control. and the attitude and
roll control. with ballistic phase simulation.

Then the evaluation tests will take place in 1979 using a third propulsion
system.

ASSEMBLING AND CHECKIRG

To furnish the materials for the tests, SE? has placed at Vernon the re-
sources required for the assembly. Two propulsion bay assembly stations

as well as two propulsion system integration docks have been installed in

a building (where, incidentally. the Drakkar propulsion boys of the first
stage of Ariana are assembled) near the vsrehouse and a clean room where
components and engines are assembled. The electric. pneumatic, and mechan-
ical checking is done prior to delivery to the launch vehicle integration

site. where SNIAS is completing the H 8 propulsion system to make it into
the third Arisne stage.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE CUYANESE SPACE CENTER

The SS? is responsible for the erection of the third stage and its prepara-
tion for launching after it is transported to Guyana. Numerous tightness
checks are made. as are the various mechanical adjustment operations.

Finally, 58? gives the CNES [National Center for Space Studies] its tech-
nical advice at the time of development operations prior to launch and the
exploitation of the flight tests.

CONCLUSION

Responsible for the design.of the H 8 propulsion system, 52? defines and
perfects it; it has subcontracted certain major subsystems such as the
combustion chamber or the pressure control components (in order to share
the work with the European countries in proportion to their participation
in the Ariane program and as a function of their technical expertise), and
has kept other components (often those resulting from existing materials).

The feasibility of the H 8 has now been demonstrated. The finishing de-
tails now remain to be completed. together with the furnishing of specimens
for evaluation and flight testing.
