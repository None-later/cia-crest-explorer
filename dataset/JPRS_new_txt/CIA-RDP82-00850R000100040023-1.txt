when the averaging interval decreases down to Y0 ; 0.2 red, the measurement
error in the mean values of the quadrature components increases by approxi-
mately an order of magnitude as compared to the error in the entire possible
sector of irradiation angles equal to 2:. however. for all systems at reflec-

with the quantity which is the inverse of the averaging interval (ru 3 1/70).

Consequently, for the case of the random nature of the angle of irradiation
of an object. which takes the form of an aggregate of a rather large number
of identical reflectors, separated from each other by a distance of several
wavelengths, the errors in the measurement of the intstanteneous values of
the quadrature components of the signal scattered by this object when irradi-
ated with a spherical wave. are described by a normal distribution with a
zero mean value and dispersion. the size of which depends on the radius of
the irradiating wave front.

The statistical characteristics of the measurement error of the mplituds
of the scattered signal. Since we understand the measurement error to be
the d‘Iterence AA(a)-A”(a)-—A'(a), then the distribution "1(AA) is defined

by the relationship: .

By employing the well-known procedure for determining the statistical cha-
racteristics of a signal amplitude [l], we establish the fact that in the

general case, similarly named characteristics of the quadrature components
of a signal (3) are different and not equal to zero. the cross-correlation
factor between them is not equal to zero and depends on the radius of the
irradiating wave front. For this reason. the law governing the distribution
of the amplitude of the signal scattered by a complex object, which takes
the form of an aggregate of a rather large number of identical reflectors.
vhen irradiated by a spherical wave, corresponds to the generalized proba-
bility model of the characteristics of random signals [1]. For practical
calculations, it is more convenient to employ an approximation of the actual
distribution of the signal amplitude using the Nakagami distribution [2).

By using [1-2]. it is not difficult to determine the relationship of the
Nakagami distribution parameters m and A to the characteristics of the
quadrature components [3]. It can be demonstrated that with large spacings
between the reflectors (in wavelengths), similarly named parameters of the
distribution laws MAO) and "(AW are practically equal to each other ‘
. (m0 = m' - m. A0 s A' - A). This permits the description of the combined

series (p - 0). Then by normalizing the area underneath the H1(AA) curve to

Consequently, with large distances between the reflectors, which comprise
the complex radar object, the error probability density for the measure-ant

The cross-correlation coefficient R2 is nothing other than the cross-cor-

Arguing in a similar aanner, it can be demonstrated that with an increase in

.ment error of the effective scattering surface of the system of these reflec-

tors likewise tends to zero. The dispersion of the measurement error is

Since we are considering a system of identical reflectors. then when N > 5,
the sum in (10) (20,. 0,» «A.» __ _I_V2_'(°),) takes the form of

In a similar manner, we define the dispersion of the measurement error of

Since the law governing the distribution of the effective scattering surface

of the object in this case (o 9 A2) can be approximated by a Nakagami m-distri-
bution, it is to be anticipated that the neaaurement errors in the instantan—
eous values of the effective scattering surface, just as the errors in the
measurement of the amplitude. obey a normal distribution law.

A discussion of the results of marbnsntal investigation. Experimental
studies of the radar characteristics of models of real objects with a complex
shape were carried out to check the theoretical results, where the objects
were irradiated with a spherical wave having a phase change at the edges of
61 ' Fla and p - s/Z. In this case. the amplitude variations at the edges
of the models did not exceed 2 68, while the ratio of the maximum dimensions
of the models to the length of the irradiating wavelength was 1.33/1 3,30.

The results of the experimental investigations confirm the justification of
the main conclusions of this paper: the errors in the neasurement of the
power radar.characteristics of a number of complex objects. which are due
to the sphericity of the irradiating wave front, for the case of a random
nature of the irradiation angle, are described by a distribution close to

a nor-a1 distribution. and are characterised by a neglectibly small mean
value (amounting to 10-15! of the true mean value of the quantity being
measured). and by a dispersion. the size of which is given with an accuracy
of l.5-2 dB by the fornulas given in the preceding section.

Histograms of the distributions of the measurement error of the effective
scattering surface of two types of aircraft are shown as an example in
Figures 2a_and 2b, for the case of a phase change at the edges of 01 in a
range of irradiation angles of -v -— +1. The results of the aeasurements
where the phase change was t - r/8 were taken as the true value of the effec-
tive scattering surface in this case. It can be seen from figure 3, where
the integral law governing the‘distribution of the error in the measurement
of the amplitude of the signal scattered by one of the aircraft when irradi-
ated with a phase change of #2 (the solid curve represents the experimental

results; the dashed curve, the theoretical ones. and a nor-a1 distribution;
the averaging interval is -s - +n), that the law governing the distribution
of the errors in the measurement of the power radar characteristics of ob-
Jects with a complex shape is close to a normal distribution. (A check of
the degree of agreeaent between the theoretical and.sctual distribution
based on a x2 criterion [6] yields a value of p - 0.66 - 0.8, and based on
the Kolmogorov criterion [4], P - 0.71 - 0.86, which indicates the plausi-
bility of the hypothesis advanced here concerning the normal distribution of
the errors. Here p and P are the probabilities that the divergence of
the theoretical and actual distribution will be no less than those actually
recorded in the series of experiments.) In this case, the mean value of

the measurement error of the effective scattering surface is neglectibly
small (for one of the aircraft, it saounts to 822 cm2, where the true lean
value of the effective scattering surface is =250 cm2, and for the other is
=2 cnz, where the true mean value is 8120 cmz), while its dispersion is
given with an accuracy of 1.5 dB by foraulss (ll). Shown in Figures 2 and 3
are the calculated values of D{~) and the experiaentsl values of D'I'} of
the measureaent error dispersion.

 

Figure 2.

The theoretical results given above were derived with the following assump-
tions: 1) There is a sufficiently large number of reflectors which comprise
the complex object; 2) The characteristics of the reflector are identical;
3)'The reflectors are spaced sufficiently far apart from each other (at a
distance of several wavelengths). Conditions 1 and 3 in essense set re-
quirements for the multilobed structure of the secondary radiation pattern.
while condition 2 can be interpreted as follows: it is necessary that the
maximum value~of the effective scattering surface in the specified sector of
irradiation angles does not exceed the sum of the effective scattering sur-
faces measured in all directions in this sector. If in a specified sector N

the law governing the distribution of the errors

in the neasureaent of the power radar characteris-
tics. due to the sphericity of the irradiating wave
front, is practically a nor-a1 distribution. In
large irradiation angle sectors (-1 — 41). the
second condition is observed for a broad class. of
real radar objects with a couple: shape, and prinarily. for aircraft type
objects. when the averaging interval is reduced down to 10 g 1/3. for-ole
(ll) does not provide for the requisite precision in the deternination of

the dispersion of the neasureaent errors. The experinent showed that it is
preferable in this case to use (12). which provides for the calculation of
the dispersion of the neasureaent error with a calculation error which does
nor.exceed 2 d3. however, it should be kept in nind that when the averaging
interval is reduced, the second condition fornulated above is observed only
for those sectors in which the influence of the doninant reflector is not
felt (for aircraft, such sectors are located in the front and rear heaispheres).
However. if the effective scattering surface of an object in a specified sector
of irradiation angles is deter-lined entirely by the doninant reflector. then
the Ieasurenent is also deternined by the distortions of the scattering char-
ncteristics of this reflector. For this reason, for-flea (ll) and (12) lose
their neaning in this case. and to estimate the neaaureaent error for the ef-
fective scattering surface. it is necessary to use other Iathods (see. for
exanple. [5]). Horeover. itlfollows fro. the conditions- cited here that the
chosen sector cannot be arbitrarily seall, since a sufficiently large nunber
of lobes of the secondary radiation pattern should be contained in it.
Otherwise. the lawn governing the distribution of the error considered here
differ from a normal distribution.

AN ELLIPSOIDAL ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELD

Moscow RADIOTBKHNIKA in Russian Vol 33 No 12. Dec 78 pp 53-37
[Article by L.A. Taeytlin]

[Text]. 1. In the theoretical analysis and design of ssgnetostatic and electro-
eagnotic shields, they are usually replaced by sieplifled design configura-
tions which are close in terns of shape and dimensions. The basic criteria
which deter-ins the selection of the design configuration (besides the cor-
respondence of shape and size). in this case are the perniasibility and suf-
ficient sinplicity of those boundary Iagnetostatic olectroeagnetic problees.

to the solution of which the study being conducted leads.

If two or three of the Iain parameters of the shield are close to each other.
then the design configuration can be a thin walled jacket. which has the shape
of an oblate or prolote spheroid. The corresponding prohless have rather
ullplc solutions both-for a sagnetostatic shield. and for an electroaagnetic
shield of a nonnagnetic asterial (for era-pie. ll - 6]).

if all three disensiona of the shield differ substantially. then as a first
approxination,theshield can he replaced by a thin walled jacket. having the
shape of an ellipsoid with three axes. The nagnetoststic problsl likewise
been solved [1]. The sisilsr problen for an electrosagnetic shield, as far
as we know. has not been analysed. Its solution is given below.

2. we shall condider a thin ellipsoidal shell with aesi-axes' a, b and c
(a > b > c). referenced to a cartesian aysteo of coordinates with the origin
in thccenter of the ellipsoid (Figure l). we shall consider the shell to
be nonuagnetic (u-uo). and its speciiic surface conductivity o. i.o.. the
product of the volumetric specific conductivity 1 tines the thickness 6. when
A + 0 and y e e, is a finite quantity. and generally speaking, depends on the
position of the point on the surface of ellipsoid. we shall pose our own
prohien of deter-ining the reaction of the shell to the action of an external
honogenaous sagnetic field H . which varies sinusoidelly in rise at an angular
frequency w. This probleo o vioualy reduces to the solution of Laplace’s
equation for the scalar potential of a nagnetic field, where boundary

conditions should be observed at the surface of the shell. which in the
general case of n shell which coincides with the coordinate surface w - we
or an orthogonal curvilinear systole of coordinates .u. v. and w. have

the form: . .

_ where e - *ii - h; 91 and '11 are the scalar potentials of the overall field
inside and outside the shell; h". hv and h" are Led coefficients for the
coordinates u. v and w; no is a certain fixed value of the specific surface
conductivity olSl. It can be seen fro: (2) that the boundary conditions. and
along with there also the entire solution of the problem as a whole depend
substantially on the law governing the change in the conductivity 0 with re-

spect to the surface of the shell considered here. The solution proves to
he the simplest if we saw-e:

of the potential 90 and its derivative 3'0, 3w into account at the surface w -

- wo, instead of the difference ‘11 - 91. one can write 92 - h.

 

. The ease amplification is achieved in siailsr mnetostatic problese when '
the shell thickness changes in accordance with dl - hole: in particular.
for on ellipsoidal shell, this condition is equiva ant to the reeuireeent
of confocslity of the outer and inner surfaces of the shell.

In the case of en ellipsoidal shield of inter-

frequency. sonsthing uhieh is explained by the necessity of supplying direct
current bias to the transistor. The precise design of such stripline struc-
tures is difficult due to the conplexity of the solution of 'tbree-disensionel

An important result of the numerical calculations was the eatination of
nonlinear effects which arise when electroaagnetic waves are reflected
fro- the surface of the ground (Figure 25). The fact that netal structures
can be present at the surface of the ground alongside the antennae permits
considering the ground as a nonlinear media. Horsover, the presence of

natural feronagnatic inclusions in the earth can become a cause of the
appearance of nonlinear effects.

[Text] A series of experimntsl [l - S] and theoretical [6 - 7) works have
been devoted to an analysis of the transmission of holograls via television.
The greatest attention in the theoretical work has been devoted to an analysis
of the transmission at Fourier hologram. At the sans the. one of the IOIt
widely disseainated schemes (or holography soon; the considerable diversity
of types is the Fresnel scheae [13. 16). In this regard. an investigation

of the translission of Fresnel hologram is a pressing prohlu.

An analysis of the television trans-lesion oi' Fresnel holograls was carried
out in [8, 9), where the distortions of all of the halogen cosponents are
studied when transeitted via television channel. as well as the nnitestation
of these distortions in the reproduced issue. it heeue clear tron these
works that, as a whole. the frequency-contrast characteristic of the tele-
vision holographic systes has an influence on the reproduced haze. however,
the specific features of the distortions of the reproduced issue. related to
the digitization of the hologram in the television trans-lesion process re-
Iained inadequately studied. In particular. it relained unclear which dia-
tortiona in the reproduced isage were due to digitisation during analysis,
transniasion via the electrical channel, end synthesis. Since this question
is a iuadanental one for holographic television, it has been taken as the task
of this paper.

He shall lilit ourselves to e treatnsnt of the trans-lesion of one information

amplitude transniaaion of tlln, 8):

As a result of the digititation during the analysis. transaission via the
consunications channel, and synthesis. a television image of the hologra-
is formed which is a function of the spatial and tile coordinates. 0!
interest for holographic television is the case where the images are repro-
duced in holograas in step with the arrival of the holographic intonation.
in this case, the synthesized holograa is recorded in real tine on an inter-
nediate carrier, iron the isage of the object is subsequently reproduced.
The recording process can be depicted as integration within the linits of
each scanning field. In the general case. where there is interlacing with

In analysing this expression. one can study the characteristic distortions

As a result of the digitixetion of the hologram by lines during restoration.
the when ilage is produced as well as diffraction orders. The presence
of the first exponential cofactor indicates that the orders are spaced lq/X
epart along the horizontal end hos/KY apart along the vertical. In order to
svoid superposition of the orders, the vertical site of the object nust be
chosen based on the condition Av .<_ Ant/KY.

The pareneter K which is included in the denoeinator of this expression
indicates the fact that with an increase in the interlace Iultiplicity
factor. the penissible site of the inage decreases. free which it follows
that it is neat expedient to enploy progressive scanning (K - l).

The second exponential cofactor attests to the fact that each of the orders
has s certain initial phase, proportional to the square of the amber of the
order and which depends on the dieensions of the holograa. the nueber of

with odd nunbsrs change their polarity fro. field to field. while those with
even nubers retain their polarity in all fields. At the points where the

which is proportional to the numbers of the orders. by virtue of which. the
field aaplitudes add geoaetrically at the overlap points of the letter.

The aperture distortions during hologrsa analysis and synthesis, as well as
the distortions during transaission through the electrical channel. lead to
distortion of the definition of the restored iaage. The manifestation of
these distortions depends on the slope angle of the reference been. In this
case. a shift arises in the frequency characteristics relative to the spec-
trua of the spatial frequencies of the object by the aaounts um and 02. sele-
thing which leads to a reduction in the contrast of the restored iaage and
the appearance of distortions in it, which arise due to the unequal trans-
mission of the negative and positive frequencies of the spectrua. The ana-
lysis characteristic influences the definition of the priaary isage and the
diffraction orders in an identical aanner. while both the frequency charac-
teristics of the channel and the synthesis are additionally shifted with
respect to the spectra of the orders by the frequencies p(2a/x) and
p(Zt/Y)(z/K). The erguaent of the frequency characteristic of the channel
attests to the fact that it should be broadband, where the position of the
center frequency basically depends on the frequency «1 which characterizes
the angle foraed by the reference wave front with the x axis. A ante pre-
ciae idea can be obtained by scans of coapariag foraula (7) to the analytical
expression for the signal spectrua obtained earlier [11]. The conclusions
given here supplement and specify sore precisely the ideas existing in the
literature concerning distortions in an iasge restored from a Fresnel holow
gran transaitted by television. The results of the paper and the aethod-
ology of the investigations can be used to calculate the distortions of the
restored iaage in Presnel holography and for a wide class of holography

protedurea used in practice. for example, for the analysis of the traneaise
sion of redundant holograas.

[Text] In the process of adjusting the trensnission factor of an enplityin;
channel. which contains a controlled attenuator. it is possible to change
the ehnpe of its frequency response (ChKh) [1]. It was shown in [2] that
constancy of the shepe or the frequency response requires that two condi-
tions be net:

where 3-0-80; 3-’-50. 3-3-5“ 3-4-56: is the ettenuation intro-
duccd by the attenuator; e, b. c and d ere chain psrsneters or the
attenuator. which take the torn of real positive quantities (or the case of

we ehell conventionally call control of the transsisaion factor with a stable
frequency response nondistortin; control. He shall analyre the procedure

for synthesizing channels with nondistortins resistive attenuators for a
epeciiied.frequency responee. Two forsulstions of the problen are possible:

i) The structure of the channel end the parsneters of its conponents are
specified. i.e., the equations of the channel (1) are known. as ere

Zach“) and 110““);

2) The structure of the channel is veried for the purpose of silnltaneously

channels with a specified structure. The noninsl (in the absence of the
attenuator) and the naxinal (when the attenuator is inserted in the initial
node) transnission factors of a channel (Figure l) are defined as:

Kn” sI Kssa " M2. + to).
“I“ . Keen - 1.“.on + ‘e + “2.1. + ‘02!)-

It can he seen free a cosparison of these expressions at K0,. - K..*. if the
initial pars-stars of the attenuator are chosen as follows:

.,-s.-I; 0,-0. c.-0. (3)

i.e.. inserting the attenuator with the initial parsneters (3) does not
change the shape of the frequency response of the channel. A necessary con-
dition for this choice is the observance of the inequality (I; - d.)2 +

+ ﬁb‘!‘ 3 0. If the latter condition is not not. then the initial paraneters
oust be increased. However, this leads to nondistorting control with a fre-
quency response which differs free that specified. To conpensate for this
change. on well as in the case where equation (l) is not not at the chosen
insertion point for the attenuator. it is necessary to use correcting net-
works. The new inpedances of the channel 2;.“ and 2i°.d should provide for

the possibility of nondistorting control, while the shape of the frequency
response should agree with that specified within the precision of the con-
stant factor k g l. i.e.. K..; - Kno.lk. For several nsthods of inserting
the correcting networks 21 and Y1 (Figure 2). the corresponding systena of
equations have been derived. iron which the paraneters of the correcting
networks are deter-ined and are given in the table.

Taking into account what has been said. one can propose the following pro-
cedure for solving the prohlen of nondiatorting control for a channel with
o specified structure:

1. The selection of the point of insertion of the attenuator.

2. Check for the observance of condition (1) (see [2]).

3. The selection of the nethod of channel equalization and the solution

Future 6-month Plight

After the 3-month flight the normal step would have been a k-month flight.
Apparently after hesitating somewhat-they undoubtedly had planned on
leaving Kovalenoh and Ivanchenkov in space for only 110 to 120 days and
thereafter achieve a flight of some 160 days--the Russians took the great
chance of right away attaining 5-1/2 months. This was a wager which they
won. in contrast. it say be assuaed that they probably will not so soon
tackle the next step which. of course. would quite naturally be a 6-month
flight.

To prepare for this 6-month flight. it is first of all appropriate to ex-
ploit in minute detail the results recorded by the numerous apparatus of
the technical-medical canplex aboard Salyut 6. It will be necessary to
study. first. the observations made on board during the 139 days that
Kovalenok and Ivanchenkov spent in space and next during their period

of readaptation to the earth's gravity. the two men having returned pro-
foundly changed externally and organically. This readaptation wae accom-
pliahed under favorable conditions. yet for all that. was not accomplished
easily: at present. while having resumed their occupations-in fact. this
wan an essential condition of their readaptation-the cosmonauts remain
under medical surveillance.

In other words. the specialists of Soviet space medicine must in the first
place examine for a long time the flight and its consequences upon the
organises of the two men. Only then can the lessons be learned which will
enable the 6-month flight to be prepared. and let us understand how to
establish the infrastructure necessary to such a flight.

This work is of such nature. it seems. that they will be occupied with,
it for at least a year which is to say that we are not expecting a record
flight in 1979.

After all. another consideration enters. in the final accounting: before
the 6-month flight is achieved it will be necessary to design its medical
infrastructure.

But a preliminary analysis of the situation seems to have convinced

Dr Gazenko and his team of the impossibility of being satisfied. for that
infrastructure. with the facilities provided for the 8alyut as we have
known it up to new. namely a medical chair associated with equipment the
complexity of which. since Salyut 1. has always been outstanding. a
gynnaaium. and use. by the cosaonauts. of a wardrobe of space suits of
all kinds.

The Soviet space medicine chief already had his own ideas on the problem.

In his opinion the Salyut equipment per-itted a flight of 6-1/2 months;
it undoubtedly did not permit one of such longer duration. And that is

- $6

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

the reason why Dr Gsanko made the decision to surpass the 6-month dura-
tion. be having considered it was imperative to exploit to the maxi-on

the capabilities of the Salyut by prolonging the Mission of lovalenok
and lvanchenhov.

Limitations of the Present Selyut

After the 139-dsy flight has been studied it must thus be assumed that
for the following step the Soviets will use a framework other than the
Salyut of yesterday....

This is thoroughly logical.

In the history of the manned flights we first experienced the era of the
cabins: they permitted flights the maximum duration of which reached 16
days with the Americana (Gemini 7) and 18 days with the Soviets (Soyuz 9).
Strictly speaking. it is conceivable that men could have remained longer
in space aboard a cabin but it would have been only a matter of a per-
formance calling upon their capabilities of endurance without any benefit
being derived by space medicine. Let it be understood that the specia-
lists would not. from their flight. have gained any valid information
making longer missions possible.

The second phase was that of orbiting stations: the Americans without
doubt could have remained aboard the Skylab for more than 84 days if

there had been sufficient food aboard. the last mission proceeding to the
point where there were indications of an unfortunate shortage. After 139
days the facilities of a station ofthetype Salyut 6 were practically
exhausted. the limitation upon flight duration having been imposed not
for material reasona--the Progress vehicles were available to bring every-
thing that might have been desired--but for an apparently fundamental
reason. namely. the unsuitabintyof Salyut 6 for longer flights.

Everything has come to pass as though. as far as long manned flights are
concerned. the present Salyut has reached the limits of its capabilities...

Experimental Stations

Such words as these may be astonishing. Do we not remember the recent
Soviet statements letting it be understood that there was a strong like-
lihood that use of the Salyut would continue to 19821

Certainly. butthmt is precisely the occasion to take a step back in order
to evaluate this Salyut program which. begun in 1971. is now going to make
us live through its third stage. a program aimed solely. let us not for-
get. at establishing experimental stations. Hith Salyut the Russians in-
tended to do many things precluded in the era of cabins in order to per-
fect the techniques making possible the development of a third generation

- 57

FOR OFFlCth USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL "88 ONLY

of manned satellites. He asaune in such case. judging from an increased
nunber of Soviet ststenents in this regard, that after the cabin and
single-unit stetion. this third generation will be nodular stations.
Therein in the clue through the Salyut program: to effect the required
number of experiments to permit preparation of essenbled stations.

And we nust ask ourselves whether at present the Russians. with their

Solyut. hsve accomplished all those experiments for preparation of the
nodular station.

Progress at be bourget

They have accomplished a certain nunber of then and. in particular. the
past year has given them the opportunity of perfecting the technology of
the Vrogress supply vehicle which soon. without doubt. may be viewed: we
go so far as to say that we shall see it at the Le Bourget Sslon in June
in the Soviet spece pavilion and no one doubts that it will be a great
success with the curious.

As a nstter of fact we know its structure. In front the Progress includes
an elongated orbiting conpartment; it did not retain a spherical shape;
the Russians designed it as an ellipsoid of revolution. with major axis

of 3.2 meters end minor axis of 2.6 meters in order to obtain maximum
volume within the constraints of cross-section imposed by the launcher.
This orbiting conpartment became the freight car within which were placed
packages end bulk objects of all kinds. Behind it the Soyuz cabin was re-
placed by s supply module formed by two conical frustums formed at their
larger dianeters; this nodule was occupied by containers of all aorta in
the forn of carbaya of various sites. Last, the engine room. or "conglom-
crate module." was itself lengthensd-its length increased to &.8 meters--
the whole having an appearance which is rugged. thin and graceful. It
appears that the Progress is perfected and the Soviets have every reason
to be satisfied with the four experiments which they carried out in 1978
with this vehicle. the well known utilisation of which has provided them
with the accomplishment of long manned flights.

Then. again, perhaps the Selyut program is conpleted at the present time
so for as duration of flight is concerned. He believe thst the maximum
use probably realized last year with Salyut 6.

tht Remains To Be Done

0n the other hand. with regard to replacement of crews--a new crew coming
on board the station before the crew which occupies it returns--the perma-
nent statknlconcept has not yet been tested.

Moreover, a great mass of work is certainly still to be done in order to
give sane idea of all the possibilities that exploitation of space will

offer: a large series of relatively short flights can be expected during
the next 3 years. even if only under the banner of the Intercosaos pro-
gran.

Above all. practically everything renains yet to be done in the natter of
coupling stations. "I on working on it." Chonine told us not long ego.

Preparation of this coupled assenbly is going to require two kinds of
operations. no pert of which has yet been acconplished with Sslyut.

first is the natter of bringing two large nodules together. Soyuz and
Progress coupled to Salyut easily. "a have not yet witnessed a journey
of two Salyut‘s. the difficulty of the operation residing not in the
greater mass of the vehicles--aftar all. 19 tons to 19 tons should not be
worse than 7 tons to 19 tons-~but in the necessity. in such an operation.
to wake the Sslyut play an active role. But no Sslyut has yet. with non
at its command post. been directed toward a vehicle. "hat is worse. the
Soviets have not yet had the occasion to control, from the ground. two
Salyut's in the sane region of space.

The experisent is nade still more unproductive by the snail interest that
would be held by putting two Salyut's of Sslyut 6 type together end to end.
The coupling would have the disadvantage of asking inoperative two of the
four docking places: the coebination would provide only one docking place
at each end. That would be inadequate for a coeplex within which 6 to 6
cosnonauts should prove necessary. An obvious solution would be use of
lateral docking places: that is a solution which we know the Russians
have studied and we have for long believed this to be the one they had
decided to adapt for Sslyut 6. As a setter of fact they ease up against
a difficult problen in seeking.upon the exterior wall. a station with
"free surfaces" available to receive all that one would wish to install.

Ten Years After Vulcain

The other class of experiments to which we alluded is construction,
properly speaking.

A priori, to realize a nodular assenbly one could be content with the
docking units which exist at present. Is this not the sinplest solution?
It would present the advantage of permitting diseasesbly.

In fact. we have a replay of the old problem of the nut or the rivet.

In conventional mechanics when you nust sssenble two pieces you can con-
nect then with bolts and nuts or you want to join the. permanently and
decide to bond than with adhesive, or even weld then. The out is of
advantage for disassembly. Its use is generally a nistake in pernanent
structures, first because the weight will be greater. and second. because
there is always the danger that the nut will loosen.

-59-

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

These considerstions assume even greeter importence in space where weight
is enemy No l with the result thet the solution of multiple docking pleces
would be improper. The denger of loosening. moreover. is doubled in orbit
because of the serious problems of sir-tightness in the cese of msnned
vehicles. New construction techniques are to be perfected. heving recourse
either to systems of cotters or to welding. One of the Soyuz 6 missions
in 1969 was experimentstion with the Vulcsin [Vulcsn] welding equipment...
with the objective of perfecting techniques of construction in specs the
Soviets told us et the tine. Perhaps the 10th enniverssry of thet exploit
will be the occasion for them to test the tools they heve succeeded in
designing by virtue of the informetion gained with the three methods of
utilizing the Vulcsin eppsretus.

In other words. siter the three specteculsr experisents of long duretion

in 1978 logic should require thet in the immediate future the Soviets should
make us witnesses to s series of pin-pointed epmetions in view of these
concerns. logic seemingly demanding thet. efter heving resolved the most
difficult problene--directly concerned with the sojourn of men in specs--

they set themselves to ask of cosmoneuts ell thet mey be accomplished with
the tecilities which they have sveileble.

[Text] The developaent of the "Nikron" high-power multichannel laser with
large active elements made of neodymium glass at the Physics institute imeni
P. N. Lebedev of the USSR Academy of Sciences is reported in this article.
The installation is intended for analysis of the interaction of laser radia-
tion with matter.

The main part of the system. which determines the power engineering of the
laser, is a large multichannel amplifier, built on rectangular active ele-
nents with an aperture of 40 x 240 mm and a length of 720 mm. A beam with a
cross section that nearly completely fills the light aperture of the active
element is used. Each element is passed by the beam one time. The use of
large-aperture light beams in the individual channels provides the output
cross section of the active medium necessary for generating nanosecond
pulses of radiation with an energy of several kJ using the minimum number of
divisions of the beams and sharply reduces the neabcr of elements of the
optical system that require independent alignment.

The multipurpose installation. intended for operation in a variety of
physical experiments. requires a flexible mechano-eptical system. This is
accomplished by building the optical system of the laser with a relatively
small number of large unified elements. components and assemblies. Two
versions of the optical system. one of which has been built, are illustrated
in Figure l as an example of the capabilities of the instrument.

1he circuitry of the first three amplifier stages is identical for both
versions of the optical system. One contains seven active elements and a
beam breeding system. consisting of four groups of lenses Cl and 02. Al

Stage hy stage amplification of energy in the instrument was measured. The
results of the measurements are presented in Figure 2. which shows the out-

energy in the active elements of these illuminators, with a geometry corre-
sponding to their utilization in the two last amplifier stages (the top
curve) was measured for the purpose of forecasting the possible utilization
of individual illuminators. The data in Figure 2 can be used for calculating
the power engineering of various modifications of the optical system of the
"Mikron" instrument. A comparison of the two curves shows that the output
energy of the system in this case may reach 4.5 kJ.

heads-y of Sciences. At this sane noting D. 8. hosbdestvenskiy was
unanimously elected the first director of 60!.

Prior to the Great October Socialist Revolution. there was no developed
optical indmtry and organized science on light and its interaction with
natter - optios - in Russia. There was no optical glass manufacturing
and there were no schools of optical cysts. calculators and only individual
specialists me involved in optical engineering. i.e.. the science of
devices based on optics.

mm, organisation of the State Optical Institute, which took on itself
solution of two probl-s - conducting scientific investigations in the
field of optics and assistance in develop-ant of the optical industry --
established the beginning development of scientific and applied optics in
our county.

The Soviet Qatical School, established on 15 Decoder 1918 at Petrograd
during the difficult period of defending the young Soviet republic fron
foreign interventionists and internal counterrevolution, under conditions
of severe econonic collapse and fanine, laid a reliable base for develop-ant
of optical glass production. calculation of optical systeu. development of
optical devices and scientific research in the field of optics.

All this becass possible only due to the victory of the Great October
Socialist Revolution. which created new socioecononic conditions for the
progress of culture, science and technology.

Pron the first days of formation of the Soviet government, V. I. Lenin
especially esphasiud the significance of science for construction of a
socialist society. As early as April 1918 in 'I'he Draft of a Plan of
Seisntifio-‘l‘echnical Investigations.” he indicated with mini. clarity the

paths of reorganization of industry and accoqlishing the econonic rise of
Russia on the basis of science.

D. s. Roshdestvenskiy was one of the first Inassian scientists to understand
the deep progressivsness of these ideas and in the ccsplex situation of an
absence of raw naterial. fuel, provisions and personnel, responded without
wavering to V. I. beltin's call to assist the young Soviet republic in
solving the nest inortant problens of state construction.

A specific expression of D. s. noshdestvenskiy's aspiration to relate scien-
tific work with the needs of industry, placed on the service of the entire
nation, was organisation of the State Optical Institute -- a cleex scien-
tific institution \mich bore responsibility not only for the developssnt of
science but also for introduction of scientific results into production.

The views of D. s. aszhdestvanskiy on the need for a close relationship of
science to plant practice and the feasibility of coeplex developnent of
scientific and technical probless in a single institute were subsequently
supported by other proninent Soviet scientists -- heedenician and later
President of the USSR Acadeqy of Sciences 8. I. Vavilov. with whose nale
the activity of GOI was continuously related since 1932 when he replaced

0. s. Rozhdestvenskiy in the poet of scientific director of the institute.
"A continuous line fro- deeply scientific to specific engineering problem.
which relates the puzzles of quantum electrodynsnics to difficulties in the
technology of the fireclay pot in which optical glass is nelted -- this line
was and should we feel rennin the axis of the wtical Institute." said 8. I.
Vavilov, appearing at a session of the needs-y of Sciences in lurch 1936.

Due to the constant concern of the Columnist Part and the Soviet (invariant.
the state Optical Institute grew, developed and became the largest scientific
center, having enriched domestic and worldwide science with outstanding
results of investigations obtained in the Iain directions of physics.

The high scientific level of investigations conducted at the institute was
always the basis for supporting the optical industry with new ideas. whose
achievements in the nsjority of cases were related to the activity of 00!.

Being a recognized worldwide scientific center. the State Optical Institute
works in close contact with plants on the basis of coqlex plans for develop-

nent of science, engineering and technology and also by participating directly
in the process of plant production.

The special value of the institute is its highly qualified personnel. The
scientific school of 001 is widely known in our country and beyond. Many
scientists of 601 were elected Isabers of the 088R Academy of Sciences and
of the acedeeies of sciences of the union republics for outstanding scienti-
fic services. These are academicians D. s. Rothdestvenskiy. s. I. Vavilov,
I. V. Grebenshchikov. A. A. ubedav. I. V. Wreinov. V. P. Linnik. A. N.

and v. G. stiadi. /

The institute's activity has repeatedly received high eerks of the mist
Party end the government of the Soviet Union. 0n the date of its 25th
anniversary, 15 Oecesber 1943, the State Optical Institute was awarded the
Order of Lenin for successful work to create end develop doeestio industry
and for scientific advances in the field of optics. On at Pebruary 1976.
the institute was awarded the Order of the October Revolution for the
results of work during the Ninth Five-Year Plan for high indicators in the
field of scientific developmnts end active participation in development and
assimilation of devices end scientific apparatus into serial production.

Many research associates of the institute were awarded state premiums end
the unin end State Prizes.

During the tires of existence of the State Optical Institute. the results
of its work have been generalized teeny tines. This was done in lost couplets
forest in 1968 with regard to the 50th anniversary of the institute.

However. the past 10 years have introduced significant changes in the activity
of 60!. These changes are related mainly to two circumtances.

The most recent discoveries in physics. the development of engineering and
related fields of knowledge such as electronics. radio engineering and
autonatics. have significantly enriched optics and we can now tell: about a
new stage in the developeent of this science.

Hodern optics has become a highly effective means of acting on scientific-
technical progress not only due to the fact that it is difficult to cope
with different spheres of human activity without it, but also due to the
fact that it can solve a nusber of already postulated problem with greater
success than other sciences and branches of technology. This attracted the
attention of many acadeeic and branch scientific organizations of the country
to optics. by whose efforts important physical and applied problems are
being solved.

Under these conditions the State Optical Institute no longer had to be sore
concerned that any optical problem was studied at the institute. as occurred
during all the previous years of its work. The institute's efforts were con-
centrated on solving the soot couples probless. eoreover. those which could
not be solved by other organiretions. end they could be solved at 601 in

the best unner due to the presence of the appropriate personnel, the coe-
plexity of the institute and its extensive and strong ties to the optical
industry.

Horoovor. the qualifications increased significantly during the past few
years and the level of work of the design offices and the plants of the
optical industry was isprovod.

Many modern optical enterprises have great opportunities to psrforn not only
design. but also scientific work. since they have highly qualified personnel
(doctors and candidates of sciences) and well-equipped laboratories at their
disposal.

m. nature of the institute's relations to industry had to be changed.
Operative assistance to the plants rosainsd as before a dependable seans of
the institute's action on scientific-technical progress in sons cases.
Moreover. it was also useful for scientific research associates who should
not be separated froa the plant situation. however. the sain for. of the
institute's influence on industry began to include develop-ant of large
scientific prograes which require assinilation of essentially new ideas and
technology and creation of new plants due to the achievement of significant
results related to an increase of labor productivity and the quality of the
produced products. The fact itself of developesnt and even snore inns-enta-
tion of these progress: is a powerful stinulus for the interest and progress
of production.

The continuously increasing scientific-technical potential and capabilities
of optical enterprises created real conditions for releasing 00! of Iinor
investigations of an applied nature, fulfill-ent of which was previously
entrusted to the institute. the lost inortant task of the State wtical
Institute will becosn to an even greater extent universal develop-ant of
fundamental and research work as bases for determining the paths of the
develop-ant of optical science and rendering effective assistance to indus-
trial enterprisos in develop-ant of new. sore progressive devices and system.

we should again recall here that, in asserting the need of the contact of
science with production, 0. S. Rorhdestvenskiy always felt that it should
be based on extensive ideas and associations which lead to intensive develop-
nent of production. ”Science and production have the rain task before then
-- to create and transfer to the citizens of the 0851! as ssny ssteriel and
spiritual values as possible. It can be solved by two lethods. me ssthod
denotes a new increase in tho nulber of workers. new plants and new sites.
The second method denotes to simplify and asks production less expensive.
with the sane and»: of workers. Science and co: should proceed along this
second path." Thus spoke 0.. s. nozhdestvenskiy. giving the report "me
Fate of (ratios in the USSR" at the soles; jubilee session on the event of
the 15th anniversary of GO! in 1933. as was convinced that a science of a
new type would be constructed under conditions of Soviet power.

Very favorable conditions have now been established at 601 in which the
institute has become the bearer of a great deal of practical experience and
has at its disposal high scientific potential and cadres of scientists
capable of solving the nest cleex scientific proble- of today.

1o answer the question of what the State wticsl institute is today as a
scientific organisation and how it differs from other institutes of the
country, one lust deternine these basic trends of research which have
either the stain position for themselves in the topics of the institute or
which are being continuouly developed more rapidly due to objective reasons
than other trends and which will in the near future occupy the majority role
in fundamental research of 601.

In this regard it is first necessary to note that, despite the appearance

of lasers which provide the opportunity to transmit considerable energy of
optical radiation over distances during the past few years. the processes

of perception, transmission and conversion of information, as before, con-
prise the basis of optics and of optical inetrueent building. Spectral
analysis of radiatidn. absorption and scattering of light by atoss and
molecules provides the richest information about the structure of the
matter. wticel devices convert and record enormous intonation flaws
during sveasuremsnt of distances and angles. the velocity of motion of bodies.
investigation of their shape and so on.

The mat efficient method of information transmission. which was previously
writing, is the image, which mankind has been using extensively. beginning
with can drawings and aasterpisces of painting and ending in photography,
television, thermovision and one of the main sections of optics of the
future -- holography.

The problem of imaging is the main scientific direction of the work of the
state Optical Institute.

Pros D. S. Rozhdestvenskiy's work on the theory of the image in the micro-
scope and the outstanding achievements of the Soviet school of cesputer
optics and optical engineering to solving the problem of developing infrared
"vision" (thermovision), which penits one to see objects in total darkness
by their natural radiation. and discovery of the phenaenon of threeodimen-
sional holography. the history of development of the State Optical Institute
even today confirms the fruitfulneas and prospects of its work on the proble-
ef the image. The general properties of images which determine the roles
and purposes of their conversions. processing and reproduction. are now
being studied at 601: within the framework of a new scientific trend. which
has been named iconics. which is based on the advances of physiological and

computer optics, optical engineering. scientific photography, television.
then-ovision and holography.

The second isportant scientific trend which determines the face of 601 and
the capability of modern optics, is investigations and developnent of optical
tutorials.

Optical glass. without which.“ as D. 8. noshdeetvenskiy said. ”there is
neither an under tending of nature nor authority over it.“ was the object
of the first inve tigations and achievsunts of 001, due to which in 1921
our country was able to free itself fro- isporting achroeatic glass and in
1936 was able to free itself froe isporting colored optical glass. The
entire range of p lens related to develop-ant of optical asterials. inves-
tigation of the ph‘ylgical-chesical properties and creation of the technology
of industrial produ \tion of then. is now being solved at 001 by highly
qualified scientific\forces.

\
Traditional research in the field of spectrum. luninescence and photo-
chesistry. tho sources 6 which were academicians D. s. noshdeetvenskiy.
s. l. Vavilov and A. N. renin. occupy a significant volune in the funda-

mental research of 001. 'I'hese traditional trends are now being supplensnted
by new content.

New spectroscopic methods of studying plea-a worked out by so: are being
developed in the field of atoaio spectroscopy.

Main attention is being devoted in the field of soleculer spectroscopy to
investigations of the intra- and intermolecular relaxation processes.

Mechanisms of energy transfer. aniseionless transitions and processes of
internal extinction of luinescent centers are being investigated in the
field of studying the luinescsnce of noleculee and cowlexes.

Primary photochemical processes in organic nolecules and oleexes are being
investigated in the field of photochenistry.

Investigations of the new phenomenon of stimulated resonance Raaan scattering
(W) . which provides valuable intonation about the vibratory transitions
in electron-excited molecules and which was discovered at 601. are being
continued in the field of Rana scattering spectroscopy.

Many investigations in the field of spectroscopy, lusinescence and photo-
chemistry. initially of only theoretical interest, yielded significant prac-
tical results. Thus. new asthods and devices for recording superweak sag-
netic fields originated on the basis of investigations in static spectroscopy.
New light sources: N-sgueased and laninar pulsed discharges. have been
created on the basis of systematic study of planes properties. ‘lhe effect
of stabilization and destabilization of fluorescence of organic ooqomds

in vapors. discovered and investigated at 601, has been recognized as an
important discovery to. s. Reporent and N. a. aorisevich). Investigations
in lusinescenco made it possible to develop highly efficient laser emission
converters. Cooperative phenonena discovered during spectroscopic investi-
gations in the field of solid-state physics (P. P. feofilov and v. V.
Ovsyankin) are used to visualise infrared radiation. nanan light scattering
was useful in study of the glass sitallisation process and also in develop-
ment of lasers with discrete frequency tuning. A new naterial for phase
recording of an optical iaage (rheoxan). which presents broad opportunities

for further development of three-dimensional holography and development on
its basis of data storage devices with high recording capacity and methods
of correcting wave fronts by using dynaaic holograss, has been proposed
on the basis of fundasontal research of emissicnloss energy transfer pro-
ceases with participation of the triplet state of organic molecules, dis-
covered at cor (a. N. lbronin and V. L. Yer-clayey).

All this permits one to regard the trends of investigations in the field of
spectroscopy, lainascence and photochuiatry, adopted at 001. very pro-
mising. which in “ﬁxation with other trends of tho institute's investiga-

tions and its high technological capabilities. yield valuable scientific
and applied results.

An iaportant trend of cor activity. which determines the paths of further
progress of optical instrument building. is investigations in tho field of
unique spectral instrment building and its coopomnt base.

The first of then should be called development of tho problems of astrology
of accurate spectrophotometric saeauromenta. It has been proposed on this
basis to develop a coaplex of a prototype spectrophotometer supported by a
system of references and ssthodo of accurate spectrophotometric measurenents
as a branch astrological base. Na cteex will permit accurate measure-
ments (10"3 of the measured value) of transmission. reflection and scattering
spectra in the field of wavelengths of 0.1240 microns. which is a record in
the accuracy and latitude of the spectral range.

A conlex of kinetic laser spectroscopy devices is being developed at cox
for direct measure-nu of rapid relaxation processes. which will permit
aeaouresent of absorption. fluorescence and generation spectra and other

optical processes in the investigated materials with resolution on the order
of picooeconds (l0'12 s) and nanoseconds (10'9 s).

Developeant of this cleex of devices provides the required advancement for
industrial spectral inetruent building and intensive development of kinetic
laser spectroscopy. which is the foudation of the most varied uses of
luninom energy. ‘lhe trend of kinetic spectroscopy is traditional for 00!.
since the 0553'. first installation for the investigations was constructed
in the laboratory of Academician A. N. moronin at the end of the 1950's and
had a title resolution of loo fa. An installation with resolution of 10'9 s
is now operating at 601.

The third isportant trend of promising spectral instrument building is develop-
Iasnt of a family of tourist spoctrophotomstors at 001 with relatively high
time resolution (0.01 s) at high spectral resolution (0.05 cm'l) over a wide

spectral range (1-1.000 microns). l‘hero is now no (1th of the timeliness
of these investigations.

Finally. in talking about unique spectral instrument building. it is iwossible
not to mention the development of its cosponent base at 601, primarily produc-
tion of especially couple: and accurate diffraction gratings. Work is being

bong the groatoot practical achieve-onto of holography. one should note
graphic holography with recording in throe-dimneinnal Iedia, where the
level of dooostic develop-ants considerably exceeded the foreign level [10].
and also develop-ant of holographic diffraction gratings and focusing
ole-onto.

It is typical that in each of the muerated cases. success woe achieved
due to the fact that develop-onto essentially reduced to creation of a
special. aoro option photographic laterial for the given problem. Speci-
fically. tho 'Valonta' and Lot-2 layers were produced sequentially (ll. 12]
for graphic holography on tho basis of [6] . 'lho latter along with the “-1
layer of N. I. Kirillov is now tho lost highly resolving along those known
in worldwide practice.

(he of tho pronising trends of practical application of holography is
develop-ant of tho throe-dinensional holographic loving picture. he lain
trend in aolving thia probleo ia apparently a process in which tho expoouro
is accowliohod by ordinary photographic notth in natural light and holo-
gram with recording of tho three-dinonaional image of tho scene are then
aynthosirod on tho baaia of tho data obtained (13. 141. In thio caoe it has
been propoeed that a reduction of tho fro-o area on which tho recording ia
made he achieved by uoing the principlee of an aepoctograa -- photographic
recording of an imaged scene obtained lay lens scanning (ls. 16].

let uo turn to consideration of more iaportant inveotigationo concerning the
naud trende. The foundation of holography with recording in two-dinonoionol
Iodia ia coaprised of the develop-onto:

-- the theory of the effect of the degree of coherence of the recording
source of radiation on the hologram and dovelopaent on this basis of a aethod
of investigating the degree of coherence of the aources [17-20]!

-- a natiwd of constructing the iaage reconatructed by the hologran with
variation of the pooition and wavelength of tho roetoring radiation aource
(21-22]:

-- a method of recording hologram when the radiation of the referent source
in incoherent with reepect to the object wave [23. 24).

The following inveatigationo are also related hero:

~~ the effect of nonlinearity of the photographic material on the characteris-
tica of amlitude hologram [25];

-- oooo conaegmncoo of the theorem of reciprocity in holography [26]:

-- the possibilities of scanning an object wave with a detector having arbi-

~- essential restrictions of signal/noise ratio during holographic reversal
of the been path throuw a phase inhomogeneous medium [28],

-- the principles of discrete hologram [29h

-diffraction efficiency and signal-noise ratio of holograms of diffuse
objects (30].

net us note investigations in the field of the principles of holography
with recording in three-dinensional nedia. 'nzeoretical investigation in
this direction should include the attaspt to relate the structure of a
three-dinensional hologram to the structure of the object [311 and to create
the so-called node theory of a three-dinensional hologran which was used to
calculate the diffraction efficiency of carrying and reflective hologram:
their noise and spectral selectivity [32-37]. The node theory of a three-
dimensional hologram was also successfully used to explain the effect of
wave front reversal during stimulated light scattering [34. 35].

Experimental work in this field actually reduced to investigations of light-
sensitive nedia in which the recording was nade. Data of studying photo-
chrone glass are presented in [JO-Gil, of studying alkali-halide crystals
are presented in [42] and of studying lithiun niobate are presented in (43,
44] .

Along the fundanental research of halide-containing photo-sterials, let us

note [45]. the author of which discovered abnorsal values of the refractive
index caused by the presence of colloidal silver in the developed eauleion

layer. The renaining papers on investigation of halide phowgnphic plates
were presented with consideration of graphic holography.

In the the field of the theory of a dynamic hologram cases of converting
light beans in phase and uplitude isdia [46-48) were investigated. including
conversion of a light wave with randoa asplitude-phase field distribution

to a plane wave [49, 50] . mercy efficiency of been conversion by holograls
with a thernel recording mechanics of approrinately 40 percent was achieved
experieentally here and an increase of the brightness of a spatially inhonop
geneous bundle of beans was realized by using a reflective dynamic Mongrel-
[51-53].

changing to consideration of practical applications, let us dwell priearily
on graphic holography. he already noted, the success of dosestic develop-
ments in this field was the result of intensive investigations of superhigh
resolving photographic layers. Methods of seasuring the diffraction effi-
ciency of hologram recorded on these layers (5‘, 55] are given. the effect
of synthesis conditions on diffraction efficiency [56) and the effect of
developing conditions [57, 58] were investigated and the possibilities of
increasing sensitivity by heating [59] were studied.

Investigations of a special file for holography in ccunterbeans and also of
an experieental photolayer with especially high resolution [60) are of interest.

One of the significant prospects of graphic holography is conversion to
photography by using pulsed light sources. Papers (61-64] are devoted to
investigating the properties of photo aaterials in the short light pulse
node. In this case the Men of the imingeeent of the diffraction
efficiency of a hologra- in the exposure range on the order of nanoseconds
(64]. detected as a result of the investigations. is of greatest interest.
Papers [65-70] are devoted to development and investigation of the para-
meters of pulsed light sources thsuelves, designed to record hologram.
Successful experieents on recording holographic portraits both in forward
and in counter beans [71-74] were conducted on the basis of investigating
photo laterials and radiation sources.

Let us consider investigations in the field of developing holographic opti-
cal elesents. Investigations on development of holographic diffraction
gratings. first proposed in” [3] . were subsequently developed in the direction
of assisilating osmods of eanufacturing then; a light-sensitive aaterial
for we gratings was studied. Paper [75] was devoted to investigating the
optical characteristics of the produced gratings: the pernissible variation
of the direction of the bean irradiating the grating is considered in [76]:
while sons problees of the surface geometry of the grating and of its aber-
ration are considered in [77] . Investigations to develop focusing elenenta
which reduced to production of light-sensitive natarial [78) and also inves-
tigations on development of copies of diffuse scatterers should be mentioned
among developments of other holographic optical alenents.

The uthod of coweneating for shifts of the object [79. 80] with respect
to recording a set of loving particles [81] was developed in the field of
recording high-speed processes and a eethod of notion picture holography
using a traveling acoustic slit in a cavity used in diagnosis of a high-
teeperature plasm was also proposed.

A cycle of investigations to correct phase distortions introduced by fiber
optics located in the object be- [82] was conducted in the field of holo-
graphic oospensation of image distortions occurring during observation
through optically inhoeogeneous India and the possibilities of cowensating
for distortions by the hologram acct-elation nethod [83. 84] using television
methods of recording [85. 86] were also studied.

The SIN-l serial interferometric table, new used extensively [87], was
developed to facilitate investigations in the field of holography.

Investigations to develop a three-diaensional holographic notion picture
were Iainly theoretical in nature and developed in the direction of investi-
gating the properties of aspectogra- and of the integrated three-dimensional
inage restored by using it. 'lhe possibility of asgnifying the inages created
by coeposite holograms and aspectograms. projected through a lens grating
was investigated in [88. 89]: the possibility of accleishing optical fil-
tration of aepectograns was considered in [90] and the principles of aspecto-
grams recorded by using a hexagonal grating were investigated'in [91]. The

self-reproduction effect. which acccapaniee projection of an aspectogran
through a periodic lens grating, was investigated in [92-95).

Concerning further prospects for developuent of holography. it should be
noted that the problem of holography as a science are apparently being
strongly shifted toward the ms of detailed study of processes of light
interaction with light-sensitive eaterials and nonlinear media. One ehould
expect develop-ant of methods of correcting the wave fronts by using dynastic
hologram and also sxpancion of investigations in the field of three-
dineneional holographic celery and three-di-ensional motion pictures in the
field of pro-icing investigations. with regard to direct practical applica-
tions. graphic holography, holographic Iicrotilning and also optical holo-
graphic elements or the nest diverse designation should achieve extensive
introduction here. The basis of these suggestions will be develop-ant of
tho technology or manufacture and cheaical treat-ant of various photographic
materials.

More detailed consideration of individual sections of holography is given in
surveys on the following topice: general problem of holography [96-99].
three-dimensional holography [100]. graphic holography and holographic
three-dimensional notion pictures [13. lo. 101]. optical proceeeing or radio-

holcgrane. holographic methods of cospeneating for distortions introduced by
optically inhomogeneous ladle and observation through “be: 91m.

seems to reduce to answering the question of whether a selected design will
provide the required image quality with given main characteristics. Auto-
mated correction programs which alter sons given design parameters of the
system to achieve the necessary degree of correction of aberrations are
used to solve this problem (to answer the postulated question). 'mese pro-

in the part of expending the capabilities and increasing the convenience of

me nathematical apparatus of the iterative search for the minin- estimator
[3, 4] in automated correction programs. At the beginning of the 1970's.
this Qperatue vae ilproved mainly by automatic conversion from one method
of search to another in the calculation process (for example. from the least
squares to the gradient method) and also to the use of experience accmlated
during iterations for further reducing the estimator. As indicated by the
practice of calculating optical system, one can, by using these procedures.
convert in many cases from a nonoptioal local miniat- estiaator to a more
optimu- estiaator. Unfortunately. the matheeatical apparatus med permits
one to find only one mini-1- located in the vicinity of the initial point

in solving a single assignnnt, which does not provide the basis for obtaining
an exhaustive answer to the question of the optin- ilaage quality in the
optical systee selected by the designer. Therefore. the developer lust vary
both the numerical values of the design paraneters end the type of estimator
and met resort to the machine repeatedly.

The use of powerful machines having large internal storage Iaade it possible
to expand significantly the quantitative capabilities of program. namely:
to increase both the greatest nmber of surfaces in the corrected system
and the maxim nmer of factors contained in the estimator and which deter-
mine inage quality. heal possibilities have appeared for automated correcr
tion of optical systems with variable focal distances or magnifications [5].
The range of problem solved by using individual program has been expanded
considerably. 'l'hus. for examle. programs for calculating the path of beans
and for calculating the refractive indices of optical .dia along given
wavelengths are costined into a single program coupler. sinilar combining
of program into cleexes which simltaneously solve a lame mﬂaer of pro-
blems made it possible to reduce the time of developing optical syetus.

a significant effect has been achieved by introduction of an automatic error
control block into the programs which permits determination of errors con-
nitted when recording the design parameters of the systea (for crawls.
nonconfornity between the nuaber of optical surfaces and the distances be-
tween their spares), initial data for beam calculation and so on. Iben
detecting an error. the machine stops operation and indicates by printout
what the error specifically consists of. This permitted a sharp reduction

of the time expended to find errors and also freed prograsusrs froa the need
to be distracted fron their main work to check the correctness of assignments.

Introduction of graphic data display devices accleished during the past
few years has ends it possible. along with digital data. to produce a drawing
of an optical system. the beam path in it and also graphs of aberrations.
which provides rapid analysis of the confornity of the optical details to
norms with respect to thickness. determination of the vignetting possibilities
to correct aberrations. determination of the position of the plane of the beat
setting. analysis of the extent of higher order aberrations and much acre.

The use of highly productive machines Iade estimation modeling of a ntmber
of properties of optical systess possible and feasible which could pre-
viously be determined only with manufacture of experimental prototypes.

The numer of these properties may include distribution of illuinanoe in
the point huge. frequency-contrast characteristics. the effect of manufac-
turing errors and scattered light on the image quality and so on. jibe
developeent of cosputer technology gave a thrust to development of corre-
sponding analytical methods. Methods of numerical determination of mm
(frequency-contrast characteristic] [5. 6]. including polychrcmatic [7, 8].
were developed and improved during the past decade. A knowledge of the
chm of an optical system makes possible reliable prediction as early as
the design stage of both the resolution and properties of the image of the
system itself and of the characteristics of cleenes which include the
object and medium in which it is located. the optical systen and the luminous
energy detector.

Analytical analysis of the image quality in spectral optical devices in which
uncentered optical systess containing spectral prisms or diffractiongratings
are usually esployed have become possible only with the appearance of com-
puters of sufficiently high productivity. The corresponding fornulas and-
programs were developed for this purpose which permit calculation of— the
beam path and to deternine the apparatus functions in system with arbitrary
arrangement of surfaces in space [9-11]. ‘lhese programs were very useful

in solving other problems. for example. in calculation and investigation of
prism systems [12].

me presence of highly productive cowuters and automated correction programs
makes it possible to calculate systems containing asmerical surfaces without
special difficulties. However. the need to use aspherics in each specific
case should be adequately based with regard to the technological difficulties
caused by manufacture and control of these surfaces. A great deal of atten-
tion has been devoted during the past decade to this problem at 60!. which
has found reflection in [5. l3].

An inortant property of any optical system is its stability. i.e.. its
capability of retaining image quality in the presence of specific manufac-
turing errors. since finding the total deviations of aberratims caused by
manufacturing errors requires a large ntﬂaer of calculations. they were
usually not made prior to the introduction of highly productive cosputers.
The manufacturing tolerances were frequently designated by analogy. which
soustines led to rough errors. We now have at our disposal a program which

permits one to determine the Iariaun variations and confidence intervals of

variation of aberrations caused by errors of design parueters and scattering
[1d].

Isportant advances have been achieved in developeent of quantitative calcu-
lating sethods for detenining illuinanoe created in optical devices by
scattered light occurring as a result of reflection free the surfaces of
optical and mechanical parts [ls-la]. Prior to introduction of analytical
aethods. scattered light was analysed only upon testing of the experiaental
nodal. whid: frequently did not per-it tiaely ieplenentation of nessures to
correct it. Cases are known when optical systems had to be redesigned due
to the presence of scattered light.

The use of sodsrn oouputer technology and new nethods of calculation has
ends it possible to achieve iQortant advances in developnant of new optical
systess. me should priearily note the advances in the field of calculating
systees with variable focal distances. for examle. the objective for a

theoretical investigations have been carried out to study the kinematics of

methods of calculating the. [22-27].

considerable advances have been achieved in developsuent of optical system
whose iasge quality is detenined by diffraction. These system include
planachroeatic and planapoohroeatic objectives for microscopes [28] and
also objectives for photography used in production of licrcelectronic cir-
cuits [6. 29. 30).

Interesting results have been achieved in the field of developing objectives
and wide-field telescopic systus having a visual field of 360' in one direc-
tion and a field reaching 30' in another [31. 32]. wide-field eystees find
application, for crawls. in checking the inner surfaces of pipes. in obser-
vation devices and so on.

Significant results have been achieved in develop-ant of high-power and

especially high-power objectives [33. 34] and development of aethods of

class with optical voltage coefficient equal to zero is required for a
ntwer of systau. The possibility of prectical production of then was
not quite clear previously. The principles of developing these types of
glass were refined and realised during the past few years.

It is very interesting to note in this regard how detailed investigation
of the photoelastic properties of alkali betel oxides in glass altered the
estinate of significance for optical glass asnufacture of rubidiul and
cesiun oxides. Previously. when only the effect of these oxides on refrac-
tive indices were taken into account. they were not regarded as comments
which could be introduced into the cos-positions of optical glass. It has
now been deter-insd that rubidius oxide and especially cesiu oxide per-it

thernooptical contents :1. P and Q. Specifically. cash- oride has the
highest absolute value of themtical constant («50 r 10-7 deg'1).

The problem of a significant increase of optical glass transparency during
the past few years has been solved not only for lens, but also for fiber
optics. The highest require-ants with regard to light transnission are
placed on glass for fiber-optic co-mications lines: its absorption in the
near IR region of the spectrus should coqrise approxinetely 0.001 percent

per hilaaster are an essentially new transnitting sediu by means of which
problem of infor-tion reception and processing can be solved cowletely

light guides is one of the rare cases when light losses due to scattering
may exceed the losses caused by absorption. Therefore. when developing
glass fibers for co-unications lines. interest in the joint study of
Rayleigh scattering and stipulated Handel'shtaa-Brillouiun scattering and
in the lethod of finding region of inhomgeneity in glass which have disen-

also point out the curious fact as foraation of color centers in especially
pure glass due to the effect of ultraviolet radiation of the surface please

The technology of producing glass transparent in the far ll! region of the

by neodymium are a unique laser material in overall diesneions, optical

honogeneity. low generation thresholds and generation efficiency which per‘
nit investigations in laser spectroscopy and in separation of lithium iso-

topes .

Among other inortant cycles of papers devoted to new optical uterials nust
be noted investigations which concern photochrolae glue and glue with nag—
netooptical properties. Essentially iQortent in the field of photochrosve
glass is transitions fros silver- to copper-containing glass. One nust
understand as of essential inortance the undisputable economic advantages
and the circmutance that the speed of photochrosc processes in copper-
containing glue is linited by electron processes rather than ion-diffusion
processes, as in silver glass. where the electron stage is obviously only
the final stage.

A cycle of any years of investigations in the phenomenon of anion conduc-
tivity in glue has now be cowleted to a large degree. In this regard one
can turn attention toward the probability of achieving special photochrosla
effects in vitreous systems with anion conductivity. Mined control of
photochro-isn by the action of light and electric fields and intensional
production of an anion vacancy system are obviously possible in this type
of glass.

Photochrn-e glass has also begun to be used for waveguide develop-ant.
These waveguides have relatively low attenuation and retain their photo-
chro-e properties.

Glass with aagnetoopticel properties has recently found application in a
nusber of doneetic systeee, for exasple. in ring laser gyroscopes. The
conditions for the occurrence of growings of exchange-bound paramagnetic
ions and variation of their nature u a functiOn of the coeposition and
heat-treatment conditions of glue were studied to establish the nechaniea
of fornstion of ferroaagnetisn in glass. A saterlal sufficiently transparent
in the near In region of the spectru- and which has swerparuagnetic.

terro- and antiferroeagnetic properties. has been forned in liquid borata
glue with cowaratively low concentrations of R203 (3 wt. percent). This
effect was used to produce new eagnetooptic glue with high Verdet's constant
in the near IR region. Specifically. Verdet‘s constant reaches 1.5 sin/cs»:
at «1 l.l5 microns in boats glue containing ssell quantities of P0203
and mo. which exceeds by more than an order the corresponding values in
glass with rare-earth elesents. The («magnetic properties of glue are
related to for-ation of unganeee ferrite ml’egog. But obviously not all
the iron participates in formation of the manganese ferrite; therefore.
develop-ant of nontrivial methods of concentrating the iron or unganese ions
in the glass would pert-it reduction of its light absorption without reducing
the value of Verdet's constant. The discovery of essentially new phemnena
of asgnetisation and eagnetic anisotropy for glass say be valuable in
development of nontraditional methods of inforlstion recording and storage.

Improvement of optical inetruent building proceeded until now mainly along
the path of increasing the requirements on the quality of optical materials
in codainaticm with an increase of their overall dinensicns. ‘l‘hs Iain type
of effect on the light been was its refraction on the irregular boundary of
an optically dense media and air. his path is close to its own logical
or technical couplaticn. aver greater attention of esterials, scientists
and calculators is being turned to laterials with properties inho-cgeneous
in vohme, which, for example. makes it possible to focus a bundle of been
after they pass through a flat billet with corresponding distribution of the
refractive index. By heat treating a glass billet by the given node. dif-
ferent for its different parts. one can achieve inhcmgensous distribution
of the refractive index, for crawls. parabolic distrilmtion in the radial
direction. uovever. the ecdcrn level of thereal production eguipnent still
does not provide the capability of precisely realizing the necessary gradient.
For the ties being, ancng all the methods of forling gradient Isdia. only
the method of ion-exchange diffusion from eclten salts has found practical
application. It is strictly subordinate to tharmodynalic principles and is
easily realized in manufacture of small-diaDster species”. Ilcvever. even
this method, which utilizes laws of diffusion, has its li-itationa.

One of the essentially new methods of producing inhoeIoganeous materials nay
be the use of space conditions. ‘rhe gravity gradient through the spacinsn
cross-section may be high due to the proximity of the disturbance sources
(operation of the attitude-control engines and the novensnt cf the cosmonauts)
at low absolute gravity in a space laboratory. This gradient may be suffi-
cient to differentiate the heavy amounts of glass and consequently for
smooth variation of optical characteristics. It is possible that the me

of the veightlessness factor in ccabinaticn with noncrucible nelting will
pert-it manufacture of purer glass than on earth and will eake it possible

to achieve systems in the vitreom state which are spontaneously crystallized
under ordinary conditions.

One can state that glass is the “Iain building uterial of optics,” as
Academician s. I. Vavilcv defined it, and also other types of optical eedia
will subsequently satisfy the highest requirements of the calculators and
designers of optical system.

[Text] D. P. Veiikanov. doctor of Technical Sciences. professor. honored man
of science and technology of the Russian Federation. corresponding aember of
the USSR Academy of Sciences is a great scholar in the field of automotive
transportation and transport engineering. a talented teacher who has done much

to develop automotive transport science and to train engineering and science
cadres. -

D. P. Velikanov now works at the institute of Comprehensive 'h'ansportation
Problems within USSR Gosplan and supervises research into the future
development of means of automotive transportation.

D. P. Vellkanov's work activity began as a chauffeu' and then as an
automobile repair mechanic. Since 1931. when he became an engineer after
graduating from Leningrad Polytechnicai institute. in other words for almost 50
years. he has worked continuously in variom scientific organizations.

The basic direction of his scientific activity has been the study and
improvement of the performance of automobiles to enhance their effective me.
in addition to theory. he has filled much of his scientific work with experimental
research. As far back as 1933 he took part in organizing and carrying out of
tests of the first mus-produced Soviet automobile at the All-Union Karakum
Automotive Road Test institute. While chairing commissions on State testing of
new models of domestic automobiles. D. P. Velikanov developed the me-
thodologic foundations of experimental study of automobile and engineer
performance in addition to direct supervision of the testing. He brought into
practice further road testing under various road and climatic conditions of the
country for the State tests.

l). P. Velikanov has authored 140 published works. A significant portion of his
published works is related to the study of automobile performance (books

published in 1952. i953. 1956. 1962 and 1977 and many articles). Some works
relate to his method of evaluating the effectiveness of automobiles (book
"Automobile efficiency." 1989. and others). Based on this research he published
a series of works on the requirements for development of automotive
constructions and promising standardizations. ‘
While working in the automotive laboratory of USSR Academy of Sciences
institute of the Science of Machines and the institute of Comprehensive
Transportation Problems. under the leadership of D. P. Velikanov was conducted
in thorough study of the utilization conditions and efficiency of automotive cargo
transport. which established the need for radical enlargement of cargoes and a
shift to the mass utilization in the USSR of vehicles with increased unit load
cupncity.

Considering the country's highway network and its development. recommen-
dations were made for transition to the use of three-axle highway vehicles
instead of the dual-axle ones and basic parameters were established for these
three-axle vehicles for roads having different maximum axle loads.

The implementation of these recommendations was hrotght to life by the mass
production of tlu-ee-axle highway-type vehicles. This made it possible to reduce
