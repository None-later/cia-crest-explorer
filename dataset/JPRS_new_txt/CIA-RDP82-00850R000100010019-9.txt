BAIL LAM MOVE LINKED DIRECTLY TO HA BROTRERS

Spokesman Finds Proposals Regrettable
ﬂong Kong SOUTH cmm momma rosr in English 9 Dec 78 p 1
[Article by Renu Daryanani]

[Text] Proposals to tighten up existing bail laws--including a provision
allowing the Attorney-General to apply for a review of bail granted in
lower courtsr-were gazetted yesterday.

And they brought inundiate protests from the local branch of Justice,
the civil rights group.

A spokesman said the changes had grave implications for an accused's
legal rights.

Far more work was needed on the proposals, he said, adding that it was
regrettable the Government had not consulted interested groups such as
Justice.

The proposals limit fresh application for bail once a High Court judge
has refused it.

An accused person may also be held in custody for 68 hours to give the
Attorney-General time to apply for a review of bail granted by district
judges and magistrates.

The proposals were contained in the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (No 6)
Bill 1978 and are aimed at remedying defects revealed in the bail system
after the Ma pair absconded in September.

They had been freed pending their trail on drug conspiracy charges.

Under present laws, any magistrate, district judge or High Court judge
may grant bail and there is no provision for the Crown to appeal.
An accused can also make any number of fresh applications for bail to the
same magistrate, district judge or High Court judge. Under the proposals,
the accused may have to satisfy the court of material changes in his
circumstances before he can apply again.

The Justice spokesman said: 'The proposals deal with a remedy to the He
situation--and that alone.

"Detailed examination of the Ordinance is required and it is regretted that

up to now, there has been no consultation by the Government with interested
bodies as Justice."

The spokesman said areas needing clarifying include the reasons for granting
bail, the nature of objections raised by prosecutions and a proper assess-
ment of information relating to the offence and the accused.

The spokesman also said that the proposals allowing the Attorney-General
to ask for a review should not be a stopgap measure because the prosecution

has not presented adequate information to the court which granted bail in
the first place.

Editorial Encourages New Proposals

ﬂong Kong 8001“ CHINA MORNING P081 in English 9 Dec 78 p 2
[Editorial]

[Text] when a man reputed to be worth many millions of dollars is brought
to court on serious charges which could result in him having to forfeit
either a large part of his wealth or a long period of his life in jail it
ought to be clear to the courts that to grant bail even under the most
stringent sureties is virtually an invitation to flee their jurisdiction.

in saying this, we do not seek to cast aspersions on judges or magistrates
who have an onerous and unenviable task in weighing the merits of the

pleas that are put before them. And as one barrister pointed out recently,
cases sometimes take so long to come to trial that it would be a denial

of justice not to give bail.

But in weighing the arguments by the Crown and the accused, the court must
bear in mind that it is not making decisions in a vacuum where the
interests of justice constitute the only consideration. They are an

essential part of the life of the conunnity and their rulings are bound
to influence the minds and affect the attitudes of many people.

10
To many people in Mongkong the distinction between the executive and
judiciary is far from clear in spite of 160 years of British rule and
there are still many who see no difference between the two. Obviously
the courts cannot allow themselves to be unduly influenced by this mis-
apprehension. But it is necessary for the Government to show that there
are ways of challenging clearly unsatisfactory decisions and that it is

not inevitably bound by them, with all the untoward consequences this
could entail.

So yesterday the Government gazetted amendments to the Criminal Procedure
Bill which does two things: it limits the scope for fresh applications
by accused people once a High Court judge has refused bail; and it
enables a High Court judge on the application of the Attorney-General

to review the grant of bail by a district judge or magistrate.

Effectively this limits the chances of accused people "shopping around"
for a favourably inclined judge or magistrate, and it allows the
Attorney-General to call on the highest court to pronounce on the
validity of a bail order by a lower court.

In short, while still leaving discretion with the courts, the Crown is
seeking an essential safeguard to ensure that its orders are approved by
the most experienced and most senior court available.

This move, forecast earlier this year by the Assistant to the Law
Officers, Mr David boy, following consents by the Chairman of the Bar
Association, Hr Henry Litton, should go a long way to plugging the
loopholes that have allowed accused people to "jump bail" when confronted
with serious criminal charges.

They will be welcomed as much by the public as by the police who face
the frustr tion of seeing weeks and sometimes months of dedicated effort,
costing hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars, virtually poured
down the drain by a court decision.

There is a strong argument for refusing bail in any case where serious
charges arise regardless of the occupation of the accused for Hongkong
has learnt that even hawkers can mysteriously command large sums of money
at short notice. And in a city where money talks the one way of ensuring
that people that people facing grave charges whether of bribery, drug
smuggling, kidnapping, robbery with violence or murder, are brought to
trial, is to deny them bail.

This would, however, limit the discretion of the court and should be
considered only as a last resort. The preferable approach would be to
ensure that the Crown has the right to challenge decisions by lower courts
which may well be contrary to the best interests of the community--even
if they do have some logic in law.

enforce its laws. -

The prosecutor stated that the accused moved David Allan Riffs from Denpasar

director of Karangscn Prison, to treat David well.

According to the prosecutor, based on these instructions , David was acts to
come and go without supervision, and was allowed to have a Honda motorcycle
for his own use. The accused PD also placed the prisoner, Donald, in a
special room outside the walls of Denpasar Prison, where the accused and his

lished by the 0.5. Defense Department indicated that there are 210,000
army soldiers who either occasionally or persistently smoke merihuana,
which accounts for approximately one-third of the total number of army
personnel. In the arny. 8 percent of the soldiers admitted that they are
strong narcotics addicts, while in the navy, 40 percent of the sailors
under 25 smoke marihuans.

Members of the u.s. Congress have held that the figures published by the
Defense Department following its investigation "were only a part of the
facts."

A former white House official responsible for handling the problen of
narcotics addiction pointed out that the number of addicts in the 0.8.

forces etationed overseas is increasing rapidly and that the number of
0.3. Army soldiers stationed in Europe who died of overdoses in 1977 was
50 percent greater than in 1976. House Representative Glenn English,
after heading a 12-day investigation visit to Heat Germany with four other
House of Representatives members. pointed out in early December that
between 20 and 30 percent of the troops in some 0.8. forces units sta-
tioned in west Germany persistently use heroin and that between 80 and 90
percent of the troops in some other units persistently smoke marihuana.

The rapid increase in the number of narcotics addicts among U.S. soldiers
has aroused anxiety among political circles. They are worried that nar-

cotics addiction among military personnel will not only result in injuries
and deaths but also seriously affect the preparedness of the armed forces.

CONTROL BOARD HEAD HARNS,SOHE POLICE BECOMING ADDICTS

Bangkok NATION REVIEH in English 15 Dec 78 pp 1, 8 BK
[Article by Vithoon Pungprasert in Udon Thani]

[Text] Narcotic addiction has infiltrated the ranks of policemen fighting
in sensitive areas, according to Police Haj Gen Pow Sarasin. Secretary Gen-
eral of the Office of Narcotic Control Board.

He reported that in Anphoe Nakae of Nathan Panon Province another sensitive
area, 15 policemen vere reported to have been addicted to drugs.

"In a special action task force comprising 23 members, 15 of then were said
to be drug addicts. And in the Border Patrol Police force. 15 have turned
addicts," he reported.

The problem of law-enforceaant officials falling prey to drugs, he said,
could not be left unattended to.

"Some of the addicted police-en get wild hallucinations. They shoot at
others and hurl bombs at then because they think somebody was going to at-
tack than." Police Maj Gen Pow said.

He also said drug traffickers had fled into insurgent-infested areas in a new
trend indicating collusion between narcotic traffickers and insurgents.

"nobody had thought about this before but the linkrup between drug traffick-
ers and insurgents has now emerged." Police Maj Gen Pow told a seminar on
drug suppression for the Northeast here earlier this week.

"In Nakhon Panom province. for example, marijuana is being planted in insur-
gent-infested areas. They are seeking protection from the insurgents against
policemen,” Police Maj Gen Pow said.

He was addressing a five-day seminar attended by all top administrative and
police officers in the Northeastern provinces.

[Text] Barranquilla, 12 November--Combined units of the Colombian Army and
Air Force captured a DC-3 with North American registration. and three traf-
fickcrs.

The 06-], with registration number h07-X, landed at the "Ernesto Cortissoz"
International Airport at 2130 hours on Saturday night, when a torrential
rain was falling on the area.

The three crewmen, who did not notify the control tower, were immediately
overtaken by units of the Second Brigade. the DA5 [Administrative Department
of Security] and the PAC [Colombian Armed Forces], which had observed their
clandestine flight.

Upon being discovered. the three traffickers attempted to rid themselves of
the corpus delecti, tossing their weapons, ammunition and polyethylene bags
all along the runway.

when arrested. the three individuals claimed to have left-Florida bound for
Curacao, and to have lost their way, and said that they were forced to make
an emergency landing at the "Ernesto Cortissoz" Airport.

Official sources said that they consisted of a gringo, a Cuban and a Colom-
bian, the latter two naturalized in the United States; but that it was im-
possible to establish their identities accurately, because none of them

but identification papers. They also lacked a flight plan, and did not ask
the control tower of the local airport for permission to land.

Troops from the Second Brigade retrieved a large amount of ammunition from
the airport runway. but the weapons were not located.

At the northern air base, it was said that this may possibly have been a
plane used by international traffickers for shipping marihuana. This air-
craft brings the number of planes captured by the Colombian authorities in
the course of the war to the death unleashed against the trafficking Mafias
to seven.
Insofar as ships are concerned, the official spokesman said that a total of
35 veaaela have been detained at aea, within Colombian territorial waters.

It was also announced that. with the three individuals who were arrested last
night, who have been placed at the disposal of the Second Brigade. the num—
ber of traffickers captured has reached 60.

'FRBNCH CONNECTION' TRAP?ICKERS EXTRADITED
Bogota BL TIEMPO in Spanish 15 Nov 78 Sec A pp 1, 6

[Text] The Colombian Government will turn over to the French courts two no-
torious Marseilles "Apaches" who are closely linked with the "French Connec-
tion" in which the criminal Laurent Piocconi, who escaped from the La Picota
prison when he was shout to be extradited, was also a key figure.

They are Rachib Charbi, alias Michel Goiffon, and Roger Bocognani, alias Max
Albert Sibon, concerning whom the Supreme Court of Justice decided yesterday
to issue a favorable opinion with regard to carrying out the extradition
requested by the French courts.

The former of the aforementioned individuals is incarcerated in the central
prison. and his health has been ruined by acute pulmonary tuberculosis.

The latter was apprehended by officials from the DA8 [Administrative Depart-
ment of Security] in July of last year. but obtained his release, a favor
conferred upon him by Maria Eugenia Rivera de Caicedo, while she was serving
as fourth judge of the Bogota penal circuit court.

Charbi and Bocognani were members of the fabulous Mafia organization which.
some years ago, brought thousands of kilograms of heroin to the United States
from France, using the most daring and sophisticates devices for deception
and bribery. The American and French authorities, in a skillfully combined
operation. managed to disband the criminal organization which is tradition-
ally known as the "French Connection."

Likewise a member of the complex ring was Laurent Fiocconi, who like the oth-
er two "Apaches" sought refuge in Colombia. but was discovered here, and has
been in custody until the government of our country ordered his extradition,
when the drug trafficker escaped from jail with several sinister kidnappers.

France had also requested that Colombia grant the extradition of Bocognani
and Charbi to comply with the international warrant for their arrest issued
by the Marseilles courts. In accordance with court procedure, the Ministry
of Justice addressed the court to request its decision on the viability of
the extradition. The body, through studies made by Magistrates Alvaro Luna
Gomez and Jesus Bernal Pinzon, found in favor of the surrender of the two
criminals.

' PLANES, SHIPS SEIZED IN LA GUAJIBA
Bogota EL BSPBCTADOR in Spanish 10 Nov 78 See A pp 1, 12

[Text] Barranquilla, 9 November-—During the past 8 days, 28 ships, three small
planes and six individuals have been apprehended in this capital by forces of
the Second Brigade for violation of territorial seas and airways.

The foregoing measure was enacted in compliance with Decree 214k of h October
1978, which authorized the initiation of the security measures called for in
the statute of the same title, the purpose of which is to curb the drug traf-
fic between Colombia and the United States.

The ships are located in the yards located at the mouth of the Magdalena Ri-
ver. one at Siape, which is part of Bocas de Ceniza, and another adjacent to
the Esso station close to the maritime terminal.

The small aircraft are at the "Ernesto Cortissoz" International Airport and.
like the ships, they are under constant guard by members of the Second Bri-
gade.

0f the six persons arrested, it was established that some had already under-
gone questioning by the secretary of the departmental government, Roberto
Velez Estrada, as stipulated in the Security Statute. This decree states
that aircraft or sea-going craft which is seized by the military forces is
to be placed at the disposal of the governor of the respective department
who. in collaboration with the sectional government secretary, will decide
upon the status of the latter and of its owners, representatives or indivi-
duals who are aboard at the time of the seizure.

However. it was announced that the 31 ships are under precautionary seizure,
inasmuch as, to date it has proven impossible to prove any connection with
drug trafficking, and they are at the disposal of the law because they lack
a flight plan or specific route, as the case may be.

The Ships

The names of the ocean-going vessels being held are as follows: "Rex 23,"
flying the Mexican flag; "Fortune," with the Panamanian flag; "Rio Chico."

67
with the Panamanian flag; "Glimtord," British; "Santa Fe." Venezuelan; "Iran

aitian.

There are five other vessels not included on this list. because they do not

appear in the records of the government secretariat. or they are ships with-
out names.

Some of these ships were captured by Colombian Navy gunboats downstream of
territorial waters. empty and apparently serving no purpose. Their occu-
pants claimed that they were bound for other countries and went off the
established course. Others were captured in the Magdalena River. between
Bocas de Cenira and the maritime terminal; while a few were discovered on
clandestine docks found on that same route, carrying personnel who could not
explain their presence.

All the vessels are freighter of large and small draft. ranging between 20
and 200 tons. and one of them has a capacity of up to 360 tons. Eighty per-
cent of the ships were seized last Friday. and the Second Brigade placed
them at the disposal of Governor Pedro Martin Leyes on Tuesday of this week.

The Small Planes

The small aircraft were seized under similar conditions, several days before
the ships were. as they arrived at the "Ernesto Cortissos" without a defi-
nite flight plan or claiming to have gone off course.

These planes are all of North American registration, and the crew members
under arrest did not show a flight chart nor justifiable reasons for their
presence on Colombian territory.

Those in Custody

Among the various crews of the aircraft and ships, only four have been arrest-
ed. two from the planes and the others from the ships. These individuals have
been identified as Wilson Rivadeneirs Haestre and Codys Alfredo Hunoz. occu-
pants of the "Eliana," of unknown flag. They are in the men's municipal jail
and are being questioned by Government Secretary Roberto Estrada Velez; and
their legal status may possibly be determined within the next 5 days.

As for the airplanes. at first six arrests were made for each plane. but now

two of them. whose identifications were not given, are in the municipal jail.
The other four. including a woman, have been released conditionally. and

68
they must leave tho country in 20 days, having first paid 1 million pesos for
each airplane. The money paid for this purpose will be sent to the depart-
mental treasury, vhile the aircraft will be expropriated by the PAC [Colom-

bian Air Force].

 

In this exclusive photo, one can observe several of the 28 ships which have
been seized by Colombian authorities in only 8 days' time, for violating
territorial waters on the Atlantic coast.

REPORTS ON THIRD INTERNATIONAL BORDER MEETING ON DRUG ABUSE
Goals of Meeting Described
Piedres Negrss BL DIARIO DB PIEDRAS NECRAS in Spanish 25 Oct 78 p 1

[Text] Last night. the Third International Border Meeting on Drug and Alco-
hol Abuse opened, with great interest on the part of both the Hexican and
American participants.

As on the two previous occasions, the meeting was organized by the Piedras
Negros Youth Rehabilitation Center, in collaboration with the Maverick Coun-
ty Hospital District Counseling Center of Eagle Pass. and the Southwest Bor-
der Substance Abuse Programs.

The goals sought through this meeting are: to share general information,
techniques and new procedures used in treating drug addiction, to increase
the understanding and comprehension of the factors which affect the develop-
ment of drug dependence in the border region and to prove the need for a
special strategy with which to conduct joint activities in both countries.

The meeting is being attended by representatives of the government of the
state of Coahuila. from the Mexican Social Security Institute, from the
Youth Rehabilitation Centers and from various public and private institu-
tions in the United States concerned with combating drug abuse.

The enthusiastic reception given the invitation tendered by the Piedras Ne-
gros Youth Rehabilitation Center reveals once again the recognition on the
part of the American institutions for what the Youth Integration Centers
are really acconplishing, a pioneer endeavor in the world to attack drug
addiction on all levels, involving prevention, treatment, rehabilitation,

etc.

The Youth Rehabilitation Centers are really non-profit organizations estab-
lished by private enterprise to cope with the increasing problem of drug
addiction among the youth.

71
Owing to.the importance of this work, the institution has received strong
official backing from the federal and state governments. including the gov-
ernment of Coahuila itself, which has been leading strong support to the

Piedras Negros Youth Rehabilitation Center for better accomplishment of its
work.

The efforts of the Youth Rehabilitation Centers consist of rehabilitating
drug addicts. but much of them are expended on the prevention of the problem
and on scientific research in the various areas thereof.

Hence the importance of this meeting with the American institutions in the
neighboring country which are coping with the some problem.

The Third International Border Meeting began last night with the registra-
tion or the representatives from both countries who will be participating

in it. During the meeting. reports will be presented by both the Mexican

and American participants.

[Text] The convening of the Third International Border Meeting on Drug and
Alcohol Abuse is unquestionably of great importance in the battle which may
be under way along the entire Mexican-United States border against drug
addiction. The meeting about to begin is also the first held in this city
and the third of its kind: and it is felt that an awareness has been created
of the need for an exchange between the two countries to cope with this
problem in a scientific manner.

The foregoing was extracted from statements made to the newspaper EL DIARIO
yesterday by Enrique Vallarta. deputy coordinator of rehabilitation for the
Rehabilitation Centers on the national level.

He added that the meeting is a dialog and an exchange of information and

types of action which the two countries will hold for 3 consecutive days.

alarming percentages.

"e aso said that the number of persons attending the Third International
border Meeting on Drug and Alcohol Abuse is expected to exceed 300.

He noted that the function which will open tonight at the Piedras Negros
horrors' club with a welcome and registration of attendees also has the
important feature of gathering for the third time representatives from or-
ganizations whose specific purpose is to combat drug addiction and alcohol-
ism both in Hexlco and the United States.

Enrique Vallarta remarked that the following personages would be present.
amnue others: Mrs Maria Eugenia Moreno. chairman of the Executive Committee

72

Effort in Guerrero Cited
Piedras Negras EL DIARIO DE PIEDRAS NECRAS in Spanish 1 Nov 78 Sec 8 p 3

[Text] "Despite the fact that Guerrero is one of the poorest states in the
country. where the rural areas have become propitious for the spread of drug
addiction. both the federal and state governments have expended great effort
to eliminate both problems; and they have been. and are doing a great deal
to combat drug addiction. an effort in which we are participating.“ This
statement was made by the head of the Acapulco Youth Rehabilitation Center.
Dr Mario Maldonado Zuniga. to EL DIARIO.

Dr Maldonado Zuniga, who attended the Third International Border Meeting on
Drug and Alcohol Abuse. extended his stay in this town somewhat, which af-
forded this newspaper an opportunity to interview him, and learn about the
activity that has been under way in that state, especially in Acapulco,
where the Youth Rehabilitation Center's offices are located.

73
He added that. at the Acapulco Youth Rehabilitation Center. they are treat-
ing about 500 persons per aonth. including patients and people who come to
receiVe instruction aimed at preventing them free becoming drug addicts.

He said that,"ln the area of prevention of drug addiction, the personnel of
the Youth Rehabilitation Center in Acapulco. Guerrero. have been using the
popular theater, which has brought constructive results: and this has made
it possible not only to inform the people of the reasons which foster drug
addiction. but also to make us more familiar with their lives; which to

us is a very interesting area for study and experimentation for combating
drug addiction on a scientific basis."

in response to a question. Dr Maldonado said that.“Alth0ugh Guerrero is one
of the poorest states in the country, where the rural areas have become pro-
pitious for the spread of drug addiction. both the federal and state govern-
ments have expended great effort to eliminate both problems; and they have
been and are doing a great deal to combat drug addiction. an effort in which
we are participating."

The subject of the interview later described the just concluded Third Inter-
national Bordcr Meeting on Drug and Alcohol Abuse as an event which afforded
another opportunity for exchanges of views and information on the prevention
of and battle against drug addiction.

He said: "It was an event which made it possible in particular for the youth
who for one reason or anotherhaVe succumbed to the use of drugs to observe
that there are people who can help them out of the predicament into which
they have mistakenly fallen. The meeting will undoubtedly be of great value.
owing to the topics which were discussed, and especially the activities which
may be carried out in the future."

HAZATLAN OFFICIAL ACCUSED 0F TRAFFICKING. INHATE BSCAFES
Ex-Hunicipal President Arrested
Culiacan BL SOL DE SINALOA in Spanish 25 Oct 78 pp 1. 9

[Text] Mazatlan. Singles, 24 October-Rafse1 Tirado Canizalez, a former muni-

cipal president of this town, was arrested by the Federal Judicial Police as
he was lunching at the Aztecs Inn celebrating his saint's day.

The warrant for his arrest was issued by the second district judge located in
Mazatlan, in connection with proceedings 12/978. wherein he is identified as
being presumed guilty of drug trafficking and the escape of prisoners.

Arrested together with Rafael Tirado Canizales were Luis Fuentevilla Felaez.
Luis Gustavo Kelly. Jesus Barrios Lopez. Jesus Ibarra Lizarraga, Enrique
Jaime Levin and Felipe Alfonso Salman Morales.

The arrest warrant was complied with at about 1000 hours with a detachment
of Federal Judicial Police forces armed with submachine guns.

At about 1230 hours. all the former municipal president's companions were re-
leased, and he was incarcerated in the public jail, where he was admitted at
1330 hours. at the order of the district judge.

According to information from the Federal Public Ministry agent, Juan Jose
Flores Medellin, the warrant was issued on 25 August of this year.

It relates to the proceedings opened with a preliminary investigation on 25
January 1978. wherein the guard Felix Ochoa Barron was arrested with 25
doses of heroin, 26 grams of the same drug and 9 kilograms of marihuana in
his possession.

He was selling the drugs inside the jail, in collusion with the former warden.
Juan Jose Rachin Sanchez, an operation in which other former wardens for whose
arrest warrants have also been issued were implicated.

75
Antonio Puredes, Carlos Arturo Gonzalez Guzman and Luis Raul Ramirez Osuna
are also involved in these proceedings.

The social representative said that the Judicial Police had information to
the effect that the former municipal president was in the city, but they had
not yet received the warrant for his arrest.

Refuses to Answer Charges

Culiacsn EL sot DE SINALOA in Spanish 26 Oct 78 Soc B p 3

[Text] Mazatlan, 2S October--The former municipal president, Rafael Tirade
Canizales, refused to make a statement during the public hearing held yester-

day morning before the district judge, despite the fact that he had original-
ly agreed to answer questions.

In the district court, and in the presence of Judge Raymundo Veloz Segurs.
the former mayor, defended by seven attorneys, requested that the charges
brought against him be reported to him first.

The court secretary proceeded to read the charges made by the guard from the
municipal public jail, Felix Ochoa Barron, and former warden Juan Jose Ro-
chin Sanchez. as well as the accusation made by the Federal Public Ministry
against him, naming him as an individual presumed guilty of crimes of drug
trafficking and escape of prisoners.

During the hearing. Rafael Tirado Canizales refused to answer any questions
asked of him, after having received advice from his lawyers.

No direct charge against the former municipal president appears in the state-
ments made by prisoners Felix Ochoa Barron and Juan Jose Rochin Sanchez on
25 January 1978.

The hearing ended at about 1300 hours and the prisoner was immediately moved
back to the jail where he was confined.

The defenders of the former municipal president, Carlos Boutier, Francisco
Damken, Guillermo Osuna Guerrero and Jesus Arnoldo Hillan, stated at the
end of the proceedings that this is a case wherein the charges brought
against him are only indirect.

They also pointed out that the questions asked by the agent of the Federal
Public Ministry of the former municipal president, which he refused to an-
swer. were all improper.

During this period of hearings, which ends on Friday morning at about 1300
hours, all the evidence necessary to prove that the municipal president is
in no way associated with drug trafficking nor with the escape of inmates
from the municipal jail will be provided.

76
The defense attorneye are confident that they will secure the release of the
former municipal president, and that they will not be appealing for protec-
tion.

Moreover, in an interview yesterday following the public heerning. District
Judge Rnynundo Velez said that there is no political aspect to this case.
nor would there be in any other.

The judge explained_that this case is being handled like any other. based

on the direct or indirect evidence which assigns liability, if and when
there is no other evidence which would prove the contrary.

PSYCROTIDPIC PILLS CONPISGAIBD 730M THO TRAPPICKERS
Nusvo Laredo BL DIARIO DE NUBVO LARBDO in Spanish 6 Nov 78 Soc B p 6

[Text] A large nusbsr of toxic pills were found in the possession of the ad-
dict hector Gonzalez Arredondo. who was under investigation by the State
Judicial Police yesterday.

Gonzalez Arredondo was arrested after the Judicial Police had been asked for

assistance. since he was beating his wife and had "barricaded" himself in
his residence.

Judicial Police forces raided Hector Gonzalez Arredondo's residence. and ar-
rested hin. They made a superficial search of the inside of the house, and
found a plastic bag containing about 100 toxic pills known as "optalidon"
and "neopercodan."

Gonzalez Arredondo said that he was addicted to psychotropic drugs, and that
he wanted the pills for his personal use, but upon being questioned closely
he changed his story. and explained that someone had turned then over to
his.

Gonzalez Arredondo named an individual who was arrested by the Federal Judi-
cial Police at the end of the week. from who: heroin and peyote had been
confiscated.

The Judicial Police concluded that Gonzalez Arredondo was placing the blame
on the other person in order to avoid the action of justice. He is presumed
to have engaged in selling psychotropic drugs and. yesterday afternoon they
intended to search his residence again in the event that there might be more
toxic pills or other kinds of drugs there.

At the tine of his arrest, hector Gonzalez Arredondo was completely under
the influence of drugs.

'13 Carioca" Has Carrying 90 Pills
Agents from the Police Investigation Section confiscated 90 apparently toxic

pills known as"neopercodsn" from the notorious addict. Mario Alvarado Ser-
rano, alias "La Hariols," or "La Cariocs.."

79
The arrest of Alvarado Serrano took place at the intersection of 15 de Junie
end Guerrero Streets, where the agents from the Police Investigation Sec-
tion (SIPOL) discovered him acting suspiciously.

The investigators who arrested "La Csrioca" reported that, when they search-
ed the individual in question, they found in his possession nine small boxes
each of which contained 10 "neopercodsn" pills.

This morning, SIPOL will turn the sddict over to the federal prosecutor,
so that the Federal Judicial Police may continue investigating him.

[Text] Tijuana. Baja California, 11 November-The Federal Judicial Police
dealt a blow to organized crime when they arrested two persons who had in
their possession 7 kilograms and 200 grams of top quality heroin. and 15
kilograms of cut heroin, ready for sale to presumably American purchasers.

The foregoing announcement was made by the regional coordinator of the anti-
drug campaign in the northwest, Carlos Aguilar Garza. who explained that the
individuals in custody gave their names as Ramon Donato Beltran. alias "Nato.
aged 43 and a native of Sinaloa residing in this city. and his accomplice,
Pablo Olguin, aged 33. a resident of Plazae de Roaarito. aaja California.

According to the information that was obtained. during the investigation to
detect the smugglers. the Federal Judicial Police learned that Ramon Donato
Beltran intended to make a sale of drugs in the northern zone; and therefore
they kept surveillance over him for several days until he was finally arrest-
ed. Hhen he realized that he had been caught. he informed on his accomplice
and led the Federal Police. headed by Comdr Clemente Moreno, to Rancho Ala-
mills. located 30 kilometers from Tijuana, where they had set up a clandes—
tine laboratory and mixed the drugs.

On that location. the suspects had their own equipment for cutting the drugs.
such as acetone. trays. flasks. acids and a precision scale. After the Fe-
deral Police had confiscated the drugs. it was estimated that, if they had
reached the black market. the drug traffickers would have earned a minimum
of 22 million pesos.

[Text] Mexico City, 6 November—-During the past 24 hours, the Federal Judi-
cial Police succeeded in capturing 19 drug traffickers who were operating

in various states of the republic, from whom 10 million pesos' worth of
drugs were confiscated.

Ernesto Barbosa Bscamilla, Enrique Morales Garcia and Alfonso Serra de ls
Fuente, who were engaged in selling toxic pills among the student population
of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, were caught by the police when they were about
to distribute 255 boxes containing 5.600 pills of various brands.

In San Luis-Rio Colorado, Sonora. after a careful investigation, Miguel Jaime
Arizona was arrested, and found to have in his possession 72 packages and
two plastic bags containing 96 kilograms of marihuana.

An additional 50 kilograms of that grass, packed and ready for sale. were
seized by the Federal Police when Mario Alberto Martinez Guardarrama and
Aristeo Martinez Ramirez were about to take it from the village of Matias
Romero, Oaxaca, aboard a late model Ford pickup truck.

During the past 24 hours, in collaboration with forces of the Mexican Army,
the Federal Judicial Police destroyed 1,153 poppy plantations which were
covered with 12,087,251 flowering plants of that product.

Also, 22 marihuana plantations containing 3,275,100 sprigs of that plant a
meter in height, located in Yacatas hill in the municipality of Apatzingan.
were sprayed.

The campaign against the drug traffic is continuing ntiringly in Mochis,
Sinaloa, in the northern section of the port of Mazatlan and also in Michoa-
can, where the rest of the traffickers were arrested.

In those locations, a large shipment of heroin, cocaine and marihuana was
seized, with a black market value that could exceed the 10 million pesos ori-
ginally estimated.

DRUG ACTIVITIES OF GONZALEZ FAMILIES DISCLOSED
'Naty' Gonzalez Jasso Arrested
ciudad Juarez BL PRONTERIZO in Spanish 25 Oct 78 pp 1, 4

[Text] Last night, Natividad Jasso, alias "El Naty," was arrested by Federal
Judicial Police agents, apparently on the basis of a warrant for his arrest
issued by the second district court over 3 months ago.

The report. which was learned unofficially, was confirmed by police officials
of local forces. since the entire personnel of the Federal Judicial Police
and Federal Public Ministry, though not denying it, refused to confirm it.

It was also confirmed that his residence was searched by Federal Judicial Po-
lice agents, apparently in an attempt to find drugs; but the results of the
search are not known.

Gonzalez Jasso. who is legally a fugitive, was in one of his business estab-
lishments yesterday afternoon, as he is every day, regardless of the warrant
for his arrest issued by representatives of the Federal Judicial Authority.

He was arrested upon leaving that place of business on Mejia Street. It is
notknown in which official department he is being held.

The Federal Judicial Police guard, who refused to identify himself, said
that he 'Bid not know anything, and had not heard about anything."

Hhcn located during the night, Norberto Salinas Nevarrete, the Federal Public
Ministry agent, said that, owing to the work schedule, it was up to the as~
sistant agent, Sanchez Gaytan, to be informed of whether or not Gonzalez Jas-
so was arrested, and that he of course had no information.

The warrant for the arrest of Gonzalez Jasso resulted from the arrest of one
of his sons of the same name, who had a shipment of marihuana in his posses-
sion at the Futurama parking lot.

Cocaine, Narihuana Seized
Ciudad Juarez EL FRONTERIZO in Spanish 26 Oct 78 See A p 11

[Text] Federal Judicial Police agents under orders from Comdr Florentine Ra-
dilla Gallardo captured J. Natividad Gonzalez Jasso and his son, Pablo Gon-

zalez Perea, father and son, respetively, with half an ounce of cocaine and

3 kilograms of marihuana.

The foregoing was learned from the report provided by the present Federal
Judicial Police commander, to the effect that it is true that Gonzalez Jesse
and Gonzalez Pcrea are in custody, while Natividad Gonzalez Jr, in whose
residence at 2560 La Raza Avenue, the shipment seized the night before last
was discovered. is still at large.

The police chief confirmed the rumors, which were an open secret years ago,
that all the Gonzalezes, from grandfathers to sons to grandsons, have been
involved in drug trafficking in one way or another.

Yesterday afternoon, the two prisoners were making statements in writing for
the Federal Judicial Police. As of 1430 hours, they were not yet placed at
the disposal of the Federal Public Ministry.

Commander Radilla Gallardo reported that both father and son denied owning
the confiscated drugs; but said that they belonged to "little Naty."

The police chief said that Gonzalez Jasso and Gonzalez Perea were certainly
arrested upon arriving at Naty Jr's house just when it was being searched
by the police and when the drugs were discovered.

He said: "But we had information beforehand that they were all engaged in
trafficking. including Natividad Jr, who was arrested a short time ago in
the state capital for the possession of a shipment of drugs."

Yesterday afternoon, prominent Juarez attorneys tried to talk with the Gen-
zalezes, but the Federal Judicial Police apparently did noc allow them to

do so.

Yesterday, an old warrant for arrest for the crime of fraud issued against
J. Natividad Gonzalez Jasso by the third judge of the penal court in the
city of Chihuahua was unearthed.

Incxplicably, that order, which was issued on 30 June 1975 precisely, had
not been carried out by the police, and nothing was known abOut it until
yesterday, when "Naty" Gonzalez was arrested for crimes against health.

The State Judicial Police commander, Manuel Humberto Blanco Erives, said
that the arrest warrant in question had not been sent here until the day
before yesterday for implementation by the State Public Ministry agent
attached to the penal court which wants the well-known Juarez business man
and sports promoter.

He showed the respective document, which states that the fraud of which "Naty"
Gonzalez Jasso is accused was committed against the hotel known as "Suites
[sic] Suzy," in the state capital. It involves penal case number 117-975.

The police chief said that, since the presumably guilty individual has been

arrested for another offense of a federal nature. the penal judge in Chihua-
hua would be notified, in compliance with the aforementioned arrest warrant,
but without moving the accused from the place where he is incarcerated, for

the time being.

The Special Services are investigating a claim of robbery of 10,000 pesos in
cash, firearms, Jewelry and other items. which was allegedly committed at
the residence of J. Natividad Gonzalez Peres, at 2560 La Razs Avenue.

The offices of that entity said that. at 2230 hours on the night before last,
that is. 2 and a half hours after the Federal Judicial Police agents searched
the residence in question, finding strong drugs, a report was received by

the radio-patrol headquarters that the house of the Gonzalez family had been
robbed.

Special Services officers Hoys and Ozuna were dispatched to take charge of
the investigation. On the scene of the incident, the police found that the
metal screen on the door had been destroyed and the lock forced open.

An unidentified member of the Gonzalez family reported to the investigators
that 10,000 pesos in cash had disappeared, as well as two "Beretta" brand
22 caliber pistosl, two ladies' rings, a telephone set and six pairs of new

sheets.

Fingerprint experts were seeking clues on the scene of the incident, and it
was not reported whether prints other than those left by the Federal Judicial

Police were discovered.

Shipment Seized in El Paso

Ciudad Juarez EL FRONTERIZO in Spanish 27 Oct 78 Sec E p 1

[Text] Yesterday, the authorities responsible for the anti-drug battle on
the international level were trying to establish some connection between

the drug shipment with an approximate value of 8 million pesos intercepted
the day before yesterday in El Paso, Texas, and the similar shipment, though
of a smaller size, confiscated here in the house of Natividad Gonzalez Peres,

alias "little Naty."
And this is due to the fact that, in the neighboring city, persons well

known here were captured, such as Roberto "Beto" Flores, who manages a night-
club on Hermanos Escobar Highway; sports figure Carlos Garcia; and the driver

85
APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: ClA-RDPOZ-OOBBOROOOI00010019-9
from the Fiesta Real taxi stand, Pablo Hernandez. all of whom could presum-
ably be connected with the Gonzalezes in the drug traffic.

Spokesman from the administration of the battle against drugs in El Paso.
Texas. confirmed yesterday to the local police the seizure of that valuable

shipment of heroin and cocaine. and the capture of seven individuals. includ-
ing residents of Juarez and El Paso.

The heroin weighed 5.5 pounds, and the cocaine weighed the same. The neigh-

boring city considers it one of the largest drug shipments intercepted there
for the past 10 years.

Those arrested were identified as Pablo Rivera and his wife. Margarita Rivera.

Raul Carrillo. Roberto "Beto" Flores, Carlos Garcia Flores and Pablo hernsn-
des.

The Rivera couple, who reside at 2312 Vyoming Street, were in collusion with
the others in shipping those alkaloids derived from opium from Ciudad Juarez
to El Paso, their final destination being such American cities as Chicago,
New York. Los Angeles. San Francisco, Pennsylvania [sic] and others.

In order to apprehend them, special agents affiliated with the anti-drug bat-
tle pretended to be purchasers of drugs. made deals with the sellers and,

to lend sincerity to the transaction, took the respective sample. when the
deal was supposedly about to be concluded. the El Paso police went into ac-
tion and captured the members of the Mexican-Aaerican Hafia.

Larger heroin Shipment Claimed
Ciudad Juarez EL PRONTERIZO in Spanish 28 Oct 78 Sec 3 p 2

grext) J. Natividad Gonzales Peres. alias "little Naty." reportedly escaped
from the Federal Judicial Police with 2 kilograms of heroin.

This alleged incident which was said to have occurred last Tuesday night,
when J. Satividad Gonzalez Jesse and his son. Pablo Gonzalez Peres, were
arrested, was disclosed confidentially by police circles yesterday but. ow-
ing to the secrecy with which the investigating authorities have been sur-
rounding such claimt. it was impossible to conform or refute the story of-
ficially.

It was said that the half ounce of drugs which the Federal Judicial Police
confiscated from the site was only a sample of the main shipment. which
"little Nsty" managed to remove.

The circumstances under which "the presumed drce trafficker eluded the fede-
ral Judicial Police agents" were not specified.
At 1630 hours yesterday afternoon. the uecond district judge. Ismael Ruiz
Martinez. took the statement of the pair. and it waa arranged with the
agent of the Pederal Public Ministry. J. Norberto Salinas Navarette. that
on Saturday morning Gonzalez Jesse and his son would be remanded and trans-
ferred to the federal court to make their preliminary deposition.

The judge added that the court would work exclusively on this case today.
despite the fact that it is not a business day.

Father. Son in Court
Ciudad Juarez EL FRONTERIZO in Spanish 29 Oct 78 Sec 3 p 2

[Text] Monday morning. J. Natividad Gonzalez Jasao. alias "Naty" Gonzalez.
and his son, Pablo Gonzalez Perea. will appear before the second district
judge. J. Norberto Salinas Navarrete. to make their preliminary deposition.

It was not until 1100 hours yesterday that the Federal Public Ministry agent.
J. Norberto Salinas Navarrete. remanded the father and son for the presuaed
guilt that they might beer for the possession and trafficking of half an
ounce of cocaine and 3 kilograms of narihuana.

The judge and prosecutor agreed to set the hearing at which the accused will
make stateaenta for 0900 hours on Monday aorning.

Yesterday aorning. they were moved from the lockup of the Federal Judicial
Police who captured then to the inside of the prison.

Consents were heard yesterday in police. prejudicial and judicial circles
about the legal status of the Gonzalezes.

Some attorneys wondered what legal position would be ssscaed as a basis for
issuing an order for their official imprisonment on any charge.

In the specific instance of Nsty Gonzalez Jasao, it was said that. although
he has a record for crimes against health. and was definitely known to have
continued his involvement in the drug traffic. at the time when the Federal
Judicial Police searched the residence of his son. "little Naty." finding
the very seal) shipment that has been cited, that individual and his son.
Pablo. arrived on the scene and were arrested; in other words. they were not
there beforehand. much less with the drugs in their possession.

Police circles also considered it likely that there would be a flood of war-
rants for the arrest of the Gonzalezes for drug trafficking. since. the day
before yesterday. two warrants arrived from Acapulco. Guerrero. issued by
district judged of that area who want then for crimes against health.

Judge Issues Release Order
ciudad Juarez EL PRONTERIZO in Spanish 1 Nov 78 Sec A p 1

[Text] Yesterday. the second district judge. Isaael Ruiz Martinez. issued an
order for the release. with legal reservations. of J. Natividad Gonzalez
Jesse and his son. Pablo Gonzalez Peres. for lack of evidence with which to
try then for crimes against health.

Only Gonzalez Jssao left the prison yesterday. at 1500 hours. his son. Pablo.
remained incarcerated in the jail because there is a warrant for his arrest
issued by the district judge of Acapulco. Guerrero. who wants him for crimes
against health end to whoa he will be turned over shortly.

There was also a warrant for the arrest of "Naty" Gonzalez. issued by the
third penal judge of the town of Chihuahua. for the alleged crime of fraud
on the hotel in that town known as 'Suitea Suai.’ This warrant was issued
in June 1975. and sent in the for: of letters requisitoria. to the State
Judicial Police on this border. Inassuch as they did not know that the
judge in the case had submitted a certified copy of the acquittal in ques-
tion to the heads of the prison. he was therefore released.

In deciding upon the legal status of the Gonzalezes at 1130 hours yesterday.
Judge Ruiz Martinez was of the opinion that it had not been duly proven that
the accused had in their possession half an ounce of cocaine and 3 kilograms
of aarihuana which were attributed to the. by the federal Judicial Police.

the Federal Judicial Police. cot-landed by Margarito Sanchez Rico. succeeded
in capturing Rodolfo Garza Cortes and Hortensia Gloria hrtiner. who had
100 grams of powder presumed to be heroin and nine toxic pills in their
possession.

The dual arrest took place on 2 Rovember and. on the same day. the Federal
Agents captured Armando Garcia Montoya. Maria Angeles Osorio and Rosa Osorio
Sanchez. who were engaged in selling toxic pills. At the ties of their ar-
rest. they were found to have 250 of those pills, known as "octalidon." in
their possession.

All those in custody are being closely interrogated. regarding the origin of
the drugs and pills. as well as the names of the suppliers and consumers.

[Text] The ties among the local drug traffickers are becoming loosened. and
ringleaders, men and women engaged in the criminal drug traffic are beginning

to topple.

Now. arrests have been made of Rodolfo Garza Cortez and Rortencia Gloria Mar-
tines. who also answers to the name of Veronica Gonzalez Martinez. and 100
grams of heroin were confiscated from them and placed at the disposal of the
public health authorities for the pertinent analysis.

In addition to the 100 grams of powder. a moderate nunber of toxic pills.
known as ”cyclopals." were confiscated from them.

Garza Cortes. a resident of 1961 Montevideo Avenue. and Bortencis Gloria.
or Veronica. who lives at 2‘19 Hontevideo Avenue. had been engaged in this
cri-inal business despite their appearance.

89
The Federal Judicial Police also managed to arrest Armando Garcia Montoya.
Maria Angsles Osorio and Ross Osorio Sanchez. with 250 toxic pills. apparent-
ly “octalidon.” in their possession.

They made a full confession of having engaged in selling pills and marihusns
as well.

A strange aspect noted in the arrests of individuals engaged in drug selling
during the past few days was that they all reside on Montevideo Avenue.

Mario Enrique Moreno Ruiz, alias "El Mongol." Valentin Mejia Martinez and
Micaela Urbins Ruelas gave those who seized half a kilogram of marihuana
from them 609 Montevideo Avenue as their address.

They were followed by Rodolfo Garza Cortez and Mortencia Gloria Martinez.
as well as Garcia Montoya and the Osorios; and it is actually quite a coin-
cidence that they all reside on that street.

The group chief of the Federal Judicial Police. Mario Aragon Zambrano, an-
nounced the arrest of these individuals, and said that the investigation
would continue. giving assurance that more of the drug traffickers engaged
in this criminal business who reside in the town will be arrested.

guilty of a crime against health in the degree of marihuana trafficking;
while his codefendant. Hortencis Glora Martinez. or Veronica Gonzalez Mar-
tinez. was declared officially imprisoned for the possession of marihuana
and heroin.

Authorized personnel from the aforementioned court announced that the evi-
dence provided by the Federal Public Ministry was sufficient to warrant
declaring the accused officially imprisoned.

Both were captured by forces of the Federal Judicial Police on 2 Sovember.
The first to be arrested was Rodolfo Garza Cortes, who had a marihuana ci-
garette and a moderate amount of psychotropic drugs in his possession.

He said that. a few days earlier, he had purchased a aoderate amount of ma-

mailman m EXHAYOR‘S PLANE-4hr: Federal Judicial Police discovered traces
of asrihuana in a small airplane owned by the former mayor of Hadera, Chihua-
hua. aviation pilot Capt Francisco Leal Estrada, which compounds a great deal
more evidence proving him to be a marihuana trsfficsr. All this evidence was
the basis on which the first district judge of ﬁermosillo. Sonora. issued In
order for the official imprisonment of the former Hadera authority for crises
against health in the degrees of planting. cultivating. harvesting. possess-
ion and transportation of aarihuana. The judge did not find sufficient proof
to convict Leal Estrada for trafficking. The discovery made in the small
plane served to confirm the degree of transportation. At first. the Feds-
ral Judicial Police found vast narihuana plantations on the border of the
states of Chihuahua which. based on the investigation that was made. turned
out to be owned by the erstwhile municipal president of Radars. The federal
judge likewise failed to find sufficient evidence to convict Jose Lesl. Fran-

HARIHUANA ENTERING FROM TEXAS--"There is actually nsrihuana in this port.
but. unlike previous years. and based on the studies and probes that have
been conducted recently. it has been found that the marihuana in Piedras
Negros is coming from Eagle Pass. Texas. which is where the local addicts
have been buying it." The foregoing statement was made yesterday by the
Federal Judicial Police group commander in this port. Hr Francisco Marin.
who arrived here a week ago. but who has extensive experience with the drug
movement that is going on along nearly the entire northern border of the
country. He said that. on several trips that he has made. he observed young
people from Piedras Negros and Eagle Pass buying "cartons" of narihuana in
the neighboring Texas port where we cannot operate. He added: "I can tell
you that the addicts who wander about the streets are not our affair. be-
cause they are the so-called 'sick ones.‘ what interests us is the distri-
butor. the peddler. the one who is a high or low level trafficker. but not
the addicts." he maintained that security does. indeed. exist. and that
there are no "shooting galleries" or "marihuana snaking dens" here in Piedras
Negros. “hat has been completely proven and ascertained is that the addicts
from this area go to the neighboring port to purchase their drugs. he also
noted that it should be borne in mind that the uarihuana crops in Oaxaca

and other states have been completely destroyed. amounting to about 1.000
hectares. and that only the reputation remains in Culiacan. and that state.
He said that sany other plantations had been destroyed by hurricanes and
other stores which miraculously intervened; observing: "The Aray and forces
from the Office of the Attorney General of Justice, working in coordination.
have made an almost complete cleanup. There is little. really little in-
tervention left to be done: and that little is what is being carried out

in the battle.” [Text] [Piedras Negras EL DIARIO DE PIEDRAS NEGRAS in Spanish

non of a prominent Coahuila politician. and the latter. regarded as a czar

huana and 3 kilograms of peyote. confiscated by the Federal Judicial Police

claimed to have been tortured by the federal Judicial Police so that they
would odait their guilt in having ties with the drug traffic. But. accord-
lng to the Federal Judicial Police. the pair stated that they were engaged
in the purchase and sale of aarihuana. and that. a few aoaents before their

102
arrest at an inspection poet near Saltillo. they had concealed marihuana
and peyote at the "El Retiro" fora. while seeking a custoner for these drugs.

PARLIAMENT APPIUVES mh‘l'lNllBll USE OF DRUGS lilRE-TAI’PING
Oslo AI-TLVI'OSTIEN in Norwegian 7 Dec 70 p 5

[Test] it will still be possible to use telephone wire-tapping
in the work of investigating narcotics violations. The Odels-
ting yesterday approved unaninously an extension of the teapo-
rary law on telephone nonitoring in narcotics investigations
until the end of i980. Experience with telephone wire~tapplng
in these cases is so good that access to telephone wire taps
should continue to be open. Minister of Justice lnger Louise
Valle said in the Odelsting yesterday. and pointed out that it
has been possible to eake arrests and confiscate narcotics as
a direct result of telephone eenitoring.

The law was originally passed in line and is thus being extended for 2 note
years. As passed this tile. in addition to the original text the law con-
tains a provision requiring confidentiality that is of special ieportence
for personal protection. and sharpens the require-ant of caution.

Experience with telephone lenitoring is considered to have been good. in
spite of a nueber of difficulties in the initial phase. telephone aonitor-
ing has led to the solution of cases that could hardly have been solved
otherwise. the depart-em clains. in 1977 the Oslo police resorted to
wire-tapping in ii registered cases with a total of 42 telephone meters
or subscribers. in no case was wire-tapping done until court penission
was obtained. "there is nothing to indicate that the telephone eonitor-
ing was not done in a responsible eanner." said Mrs Valle.

The question of a permanent law will probably be taken up when nore experi-
enee has been gained with the teeporm-y law. according to the Justice
conittee. ahich considered the utter before yesterday's discussion in
the Odeisting. Minister \‘alle expressed the sane point of view.

'lhe teemrary law and the propOsal to extend it have been up for discus-
sion on o nudner of occasions. Only Km [expansion unknown] is definitely
against the law. but the liefense Counsel Group of l977 wires 3 sceptical
attitude. too. it is especially strongly against certain parts of the

116
provisions. and takes particular exception to the fact that telephones that
belong to doctors. clergy'sen. and others who are known to receive profes-
sional oonfidences can be Ionltored.

The chalrsan. Potter Furberg (a) [Anders Lenge's Party‘ll. sold with regard
to this and to the discussion on the some subject in the newspapers that
the objections appear to be based on a nisunderstandlng. "i find reason to
enphasite the law's basis for a possible telephone check." said Furberg.
who pointed out that sufficient grounds oust erist for suspicion of gross
violation of the narcotics legislation. such as sale. aanufacture. iaporta-
tion. or the like. and that court permission oust be obtained.

lle eoﬁiulted that the court can give permission only if it is presuoed
that such monitoring will be of essential significance in clarifying the
case. when it comes to the special position that certain occupational
groups. such as doctors. ciergynen. and lawyers. occupy in this connection.
their telephones can be oonitored only if special reasons exist. unless
they themselves are suspected in the case.

According to the low peralssion cannot be given for monitoring telephones
that suspected persons can be expected to oaks calls to. But the telephone
at a lav office. for era-pie. can be tapped if it is assumed that a suspect
would use such a telephone.

"it is not a nutter of extensive aonltoring of random telephones. but of a
telephone check on the basis of specific suspicion and with the court's per-
mission.“ soyd Furberg.

Minister of Justice Valle also went into what she called the serious theo-
retical objections that 'can be raised against allowing the authorities to
monitor the telephones of private individuals. This involves such a seri-
ous encroachment on the rights of the individual that there is reason to
carry on a continuing appraisal of whether telephone monitoring should be
approved in these cases, the sinister of jt “it. sold. and she also said
that "against the background of the experience that we have had up to new
with telepMne monitoring in these cases. the govern-cot has decided that
decisive eeight must be attached to the consideration of effectively com-
hatting the very serious crimes with which we are faced."

Minister Valle said that as far as she knew there had been no monitoring
of teleidiunes that belong to doctors. clergy-en. or lawyers. "As for as
possible. monitoring telephones thnt belong to such persons should be
avoided." said llrs Valle. who pointed out the are rigorous conditions that
list he met heron: such telephones can be monitored.

Oslo amnmsm in Norwegian 6 Dec 70 pp 1, 6

[Text] The new central narcotics section of the Oslo police has
been foraaily established. but only in none. it nay be a long
tile before the section can give the other police forces of
Norway the help in the fight against drug traffickers that the
authorities intended. vollce Chief Rolf Solea tells NTO [Nor-
wegian News Agency] that the plan is to reinforce the section
with SO detectives and investigators. bringing the strength up
to about 70. but that the Ianpower shortage oakes it difficult.

"lie have 60 vacant positions," the police chief says. "and just in Novedrer
we were drawn upon for 9 policeaon that were assigned outside of the city.
Expansion of the narcotics section would therefore have to be at the ex-
pense of the regular patrol section. which aany think should also be rein-
orced."

The disputed position of head of the section has not yet been filled. for
the tine being the section has only a unit chief and one other officer. just
as the situation was at Victoria Terrace before the love to the police house
last week. The intention is to get three unit chiefs and eight officers.

Lars Steuhaug. head of the finance office. says that the new positions as
unit chiefs and police officers will be established as of l July I979, but
that the finance depart-out probably can effect a redistribution so that it
my be possible at an earlier tine.

"Anyway." says Stemhaug. "it will not be until suner that the police school
will graduate a new class of about 360 police-en and policewomn to fill the
vacant positions in Oslo. The next 2 years the classes will be saaller.

but we are ailing at increasing the adaission of candidates."

Cont i nued llnde rstaffiag

Anton (la-elgr'trd. personnel chief of the Oslo police. tells me that he is
afraid the pol ice force will be under strength for sewer-oi years because of

118
the draft and because any are reaching the age linit.

"Acconlln; to an overall plan for the period 1976-1931 it is stated that the
police force will get a total of 300 new billets. while about 60 new billets
have been authorised thus far. Next sue-er we get 55 new billets. but that
does not help ouch if the adelsslon of police candidates is not increased."
the personnel chief says. Ile points out that the nuaher named this year
and next year is no fewer than was expected earlier, and that next year
120 officers can retire on reaching the age liait of 57.

"They nust leave when they reach 60 according to the regulations. and the

prohiegof these retireeents will increase during the 1980's," says
Uanoelgarti.

Olaf Ohnstad. the head of the police union. thinks that the unpower short-

age nay hecone al-ost catastrophic unless soeething is done soon shout re-
cruitlng.

Cutbach Also liits Police llepartnent

"The reduction by loo police candidates in the l979 budget notes the diffi-
culties still greater. and that decision therefore needs to he altered."
says Ohnstad.

lie thinks that two inportant causes are the poor housing situation in Oslo
and the fact that few Oslo youths choose police work.

"lhe police force has had an offer of 200 apart-once near T‘yen

l‘art if it will adainister the oanagolent of thee itself. but that is a
question that has been waiting for decision in the Justice depart-ant for
a long tine. ‘that project can solte the housing pnhlens to a certain ex-
tent lt‘ it is approved," Ohnstad says.

in his opinion the system of assignaents within the police force frightens
nany away free a police career.

"In ey opinion the systee of assign-eat is not very deaocratic. in the
first year of service after police school they run the risk of assignoent

to any police force anywhere in the country against their wishes." says
tlhnstad.

BUDGET ans HURT NM! 08 YOUI‘II DRUG PROBE”
Oslo melanoma? in Nomgien a Dec 70 p 16
[Article by Tone ll. Jaeholt]

[TestIProbleas along Oslo youth have shown a steady increase
all fall. ARBBloERBLADET got conflrsation of this free the
vagrancy section. Every day a gang of young people gather at
the subway stationon.lernbanotorget l- Railway Sqﬂlfol and
sniff drugs openly. There also seen to be increasing problees
with young prostitutes on Stenersgata. .
Free the district police precincts. too, increasing drug abuse
and other probiens are reported. This is happening at a tine
when the vagrancy section runs the risk of having to cut back
on its activity because of the l979 budget situation.

People who take the subway have begun to react to the gathering of youths
that takes place at the stations. The sniffing that goes on there has not
been equalled for a long tine, and the snell of heroin hangs heavy in the
air of the stations.

«am For-o berntsen and Jo Kittelsen of the Oslo vagrancy section tell
snatlnzasumr that they fear an intensified conflict between the honeless
”street youth" and the nest of the population. Agitation nay develop on
both sides that can lead to a big conflict. They point out that the drug
abuse say be greater than has been assuned. They have also noticed greater
unrest among young people. and believe there is a lot of frustration there.

The htalget proposal for the vagrancy section that was prepared by the con-
nissioner of finances struck the emloyees like a cold shower. They have
had a great increase in the nt-ber of calls. and they thenseives think they
need in aore hlllets. They proposed a budget of 5.8 Iillion kroner for
1979. The co-issioner for social services reduced the budget another nil-
llon. There went the extra billets. Unless the state gives a subsidy of
2.5 ellllnn hroner. the scope of the activity will have to be cut back.

120
in a number of comunications the elployees have called attention to the
work situation they are in, and the budget proposal has brought sharp re-
actions. To stress this. they have dropped the investigative activity.
Berntsen and Kittelsen think the budget proposal will still be examined none
carefully in the light of the increasing probleas that have been reported
along youths. There has been talk fro- the rostrum in parllaeent about the
necessity of increasing the work along youths who use drugs, but as the en-
pioyees see it that is going about the natter entirely the wrong way round.

The eeployoes of the vegrency section think that nobody will take up the
social problens that are current in the youth groups unless their work is
continued and strengthened. Youths. especially the youngest, feel safe
when they know that people fro- that section are nearby. llho will have the
responsibility for thee if the vegrancy section cannot follow up, the en-
ployees ask.

"If this budget proposal goes through. the situation will get worse." say

Berntsen and Kittelsen. "The authorities nust see the handwriting on the
wall. We have to deal with homeless kids is and l6 years old."

2.! kilograas of hashish, 2.5 kilograas of cannabis oil, and about 200 L30
tablets. Also, purchase of 3 kilograas of hashish free two Danish citizens.
One of these will have his case heard in Eidsivating circuit court this
caning Monday. Dennark has asked that the other he returned, since there
is a stronger penalty for sale of narcotics in Norway than in Den-ark.

Nest of the selling of the narcotics took place on a far- at Lindis, just
outside of Bergen. The total sales value was about 400,000 kroner. The
authorities seized l02,000 kroner in the case, which they think is the yield
frea the sale of arcotics.

in justifying the heavy penalty, the court laid weight on the professional
character of the case. We defendant was believed to be the second in can-
und in the gang; the top Ian was also fro. Stavanger, but died in prison
earlier this year.

“ﬁve hashish and the cannabis oil were snuggled into Norway in sherry bottles.
The defendant had been abroad and snuggled in drugs three tines. The court
also pointed out that the operation involved secret places in and outside of
Bergen where the narcotics were stored. iiidden secret mas. cover apart-
aents. and false driver's licenses also figured in the case.

Ileroin Also in Prison

However. even imprisonment did not help. During an outside visit in
December 1977 he brought heroin back with him to the prison and injected
himself in the prieon's own carpenter shop where he was being trained as
a carpenter. After his release in May of this year. the end was marked
out. In July he attracted the police'e attention as a participant in a
robbery. The day before yesterday he took his own life.

It is unusual that a drug addict would commit suicide. This was also con-
firmed by the berlin Senate's drug agent ﬂeckmann. Even the "golden shot."
the voluntary overdose causes only a third of the deaths. The overwhelming
majority of drug victims die unintentionally. "An accident." says ﬂeckmenn.
”which can happen to any narcotics user. be it after I or after 5 years."

l’or actually. uncertainty about the concentration of the drug leads to the
last shot. Drug agent ﬂeckmenn in this way partially explains the high
number of deaths last year. In the first month of 1977 a changeover took
place on the Berlin drug market. Durgs were no longer coming from the Far
East by way of Amsterdam but from Turkey over the Balkans. Drug related
deaths rose substantially. because no fixer knew what concentration he was
injecting. In addition. no one knew to what extent the long chain of deal-
ers had diluted the drugs.

Thirty Drug Emergencies a Month

The criminal police also attribute the reduced number of drug victims to
increased instruction in schools. enterprises and in the media. The further
education of doctors has also borne fruit. The number of drug accidents in-
dicates this. On the average, 30 drug addicts are brought to the Berlin
clinic each month because of acute danger. Since the beginning of the year
that amounts to 300: Opposed to this is the number of 50 dead. Drug ex-
perts also race-end that anyone who discovers a possible acute drug emer-
gency. which can be indicated by difficulty in breathing or unconsciousness.
should immediately call the fire department or an ambulance. In no case
should one try rescue measures himself.

Most Dangerous After withdrawal

The risk of death is greatest for addicts who have withdrawn for a short
time. "edema. in connection with this. made an appeal to all parents
faced with the problem not to undertake withdrawal attempts with their
children by themselves. when someone has withdrawn from drugs for a few
days and then has the opportunity again for a fix. his chances for a final
shot are extremely high.

This year Berlin is spending an additional mi 8.6 million to try to come
to grips with the problems. The number of deaths has indeed dropped.

126
however. the percentage of female drug addicts ie growing steadily. Iren-
eition inetelletione are to leceen the risk of death in acute cases. One
thing both drug agents and nercotice deelere know: The Slut drug victim
will not live Inch longer.

NARCOTICS SHUGCLING INTO COUNTRY DISCUSS£D
Vest Berlin 08R TAGHSSPIEGBL in German 19 Oct 78 p 30

[Text] Approximately 3.000 narcotics smugglers have been caught by border
and customs agents in the first 6 months of this year. That is approxi-
mately 10 percent fewer than last year. however. as was also announced on
wednesday by the government news agency in Bonn. agents have taken more
heroin and LSD than ever before. Border agents were able to confiscate 83
kilos of heroin alone. while in the first half of 1977 it was only 10
kilos and in the second half 14 kilos.

The amount of LSD confiscated has also greatly increased. The agents
found 6.235 so-called trips on smugglers. as opposed to 561 in the first
half and 1.008 in the second half of 1977. On the other hand. the amount
of hash and marijuana decreased to 736 kilos. from 1.288 kilos in the
first half of last year and 3.815 kilos in the second half.

According to government reports there were no special developments in the
other common drugs such as opium (1.1 kilos). cocaine (1.6 kilos) and em-
phetamines (1.7 kilos).

As in the past. the major point of narcotics smuggling was the German-
Netherlands border with a share of 79.1 percent. A growing number of ar-
rests occurred on the border with the son in through traffic. with 9.1
percent as opposed to 7.5 percent in the first half of 1977. The border
with France is third with 3.7 percent. followed by the border with Switzer-
land with 3.1 percent. About 50 percent of the smuggling is done by high-
way, about 17.4 percent by train. About 3.2 percent of the smuggling cases
occurred in the customs area and in the barracks area of troops stationed

there. the rest occurred on the green border. the harbors. the airports and
Interior waterways.

back with him from Bulgaria to Munich in June on behalf of an unknown
Persian. Unfortunately the receiver turned out to be the comaiesioner of
the Bavarian Criminal Division (BRA). Because this was the largest amount
of heroin to have surfaced in Bavaria up until now, the 17th Criminal Court
of the Munich County Court I sentenced Sarac to the naxiaua sentence of 10
years for illegal drug trafficking.

The elegantly tailored suit which the accused from Stedelheia wore in court
gave him the flair of a well-situated businessman of international style.
He did not deny the charges-possibly because this would be useless. con-
sidering the evidence.

According to him. he had transported the drug from Sofia for a Persian.
That did not appear very credible to the court. but it could not be re-
futed-since it could not be proven. when he arrived in Munich with the
"stuff,“ the LIA had already received a tip. A commissioner came forward
as an apparent buyer and mat with Sarsc at noon on 19 June at Kaiser Lud-
wig Place. Sarac was to hand over to him exactly 2 kilos of stuff with 85
percent purity for on 160,000. The accused could of course no longer poc-
ket the hoped for profit since he was arrested during the close of the
transaction.

Stuff For 120.000 Shots

The court calculated that the amount of the drug confiscated in the take could
easily be diluted to double because of its excellent quality and would be suffi-
cient for 120,000 "shots." The maximum sentence was therefore imposed. with
chief Justice Josef Peter Stoschek indicating that in view of the quantity and
the dangerousness of heroin. 10 years was actually too few. The accused could
count himself lucky that he did not have to answer for the crime in his native
country, where he would have been threatened with a life sentence if not with
the death penalty. The court would have been able to pronounce a lesser sea-
tence. if the accused had named his accomplices. but he did not do so.

COCAINB DEALER ARRESTED-This weekend investigators from the Bavarian crin-
inal division confiscated around 200 areas of cocaine with a street value
of approximately DH 100.000 and arrested the seller, Hana Dieter B. (26)
and the potential buyer Harald St. (26). The 26-year-old has been known

to the police for years as a narcotics dealer. He had worked as e re-
tailer. offering what was in demand at the noaent. from haeh to LSD.

During the past few weeks he had been looking in a diacotheque in the

train station area for a buyer for cocaine, which euppoeedly had just been
flown in from Bolivia. He was followed for several days and finally ar-
rested in front of a departeent store in Swahing as he was trying to pass
the package with the drug to the prospective buyer, Harald St. Cocaine was
last confiscated in Munich 2 years ago. At that tine it was a question of
1.5 kilos, worth about a million marks. As Konrad Beer, chief of the crin-
inal counsel of the Land criminal division. explained. it is currently dif-
ficult to sell cocaine in Munich. There is little interest in the South
Alarican drug. [Text] [Munich SUEDDEUTSCHB ZBITUNG in German lb Nov 78
