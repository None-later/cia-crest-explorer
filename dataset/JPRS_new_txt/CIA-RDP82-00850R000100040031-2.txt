[Article by I. I. shagurin]

[Text] An examination is made of possible methods of
structural organization of digital systems based on 121.
for reducing power consuption P and switching factor A.
It is shown that staged connection of inJection coupled
I81 chips with series-connected injectors reduces the
values of A and P by a factor of four, while the use of
active-passive supply cuts these parameters by an order
of magnitude or more. liew types of microcircuits are
suggested for realizing these advantages.

Among the bipolar transistor logic circuits, those based on integrated
inJection logic (1%) give the lowest switching factors A-Ptg, where P.

t3 are the average power consumption and switching delay. Estimates made
with consideration of future improvements in techniques for making 12!.
uicrocircuita give a minimum limiting value ‘min' (10"5-10'”) J (Ref. 1].
The best values of A that have been achieved up to the present for individual
:31. circuits are (2-5)-1o*"° J tau. 1. 2].

however. the practical values of the switching factor realised in inJection
digital microcircuits under actual working conditions are considerably
higher (by a factor of 5-10) since the limiting estimates and experimental
data cited above were obtained at rather low supply voltages (El-0.15 V in
Ref. 1, 5-0.8 V in the experimental tests of Ref. 2). As shown in Ref. 3.
to ensure adequately stable operation of inJection microcircuits it is
necessary to use a supply voltage Eskuui, where 01 is the voltage drop on
the open inJector Junction, X“- (30-5) is the coefficient of power losses
to stabilization. In practice. there are also a nmber of other reasons
why it is undesirable to use power supplies with low voltage 352 V in digital
devices. Low-voltage supplies have reduced stability, efficiency and load

handling capacity. Signal transmission through external circuits with
adequate interference immunity requires elevated values of the logical
differential. which are attained by a corresponding increase in the supply
voltage. InJection microcircuits are ordinarily used together with 'i'i'L
microcircuits that have a typical supply voltage of 5.0 V. The addition
of a low-voltage supply is detrimental to the overall characteristics of
the digital device. Under these conditions. the following circuit-design
techniques are offered for reducing the switching factor of inJection
microcircuits.

Sequential (staged) supply of LS! tweeters. when this nethod is used. the
inacctor supply circuits of several chips are connected to the power source
in sequence (Fig. 1). mo versions are possible for organizing the supply
of inJcction microcircuits in the digital device.

In the case of direct cascading (Fig. la) the digital system is actually
several independent data processing devices (channels) [Ref. la]. The logic
levels of the nicrocircuits included in the different stages (channels) differ
by an amount A00. (50' Iaui, where a-l,..., (k-l). k is the number of

stages (channels). Information can he transferred directly from the lower to
the upper channels, and infbnation can be transferred from the upper channels
to the lower ones through ntching transistors [Ref. 5]. However. in this
case there is a considerable reduction in the speed due to the increased

logic differential for signals between channels by an amount 001, and there

is an increase in the area of the crystal and the power consumption due to
energizing of the matching elements. Therefore it is advisable to keep the
number of connections between channels to a minim.

The input device distributes the information coming in to be processed among ,
the channels of the systeu, ensuring the required levels of 'the input logic 2‘
signals for each channel (stage). In principle, the input device is capable
of "paralleling" the solution of a general problem anong k channels. In

this case the input device includes a progra-sable permanent semory or sicro-
processor. The input device transforms signals entering from different
channels, providing standard levels of logic signals and the necessary load
handling capacity at the output of the system. The output device can also
carry out certain logical transfonations of infornation: multiplexing, '.
mashing, channel switching and the like.

In the mainline amngmnt (Fig. lb) all devices of the digital system
exchange interaction through a comon ninlins by intermediate I/O devices.
'i‘he.signals in the mainline have unified standard logic levels. 'ihe I/O
devices ensure forward and reverse conversion of the levels of the logic
signals in the mainline and in the inJection L31 chips of the different
stages. me logic levels of the signals of the different stages differ by
60°. 60‘. and therefore the information is exchanged between stages mainly
through the I/O devices and the mainline. Direct connection (cascading) is
possible only between different L81 chips of a single stage, and also from
the outputs of the IS! chips of the lover stages to the inputs of those in
the upper stages. 'ihe 1/0 devices in this arrangement. in addition to the
functions of transforming logic levels and ensuring the load handling
capacity necessary for the mainline, can also perform certain logic functions:
multiplexing. various conutation of signals on mainlines and the like.

Supply to the inJection I81 chips included in the different stages of the
digital system can be most effectively handled by sources of stable current
based on p-n transistors. as shown in Pig. 2. These circuits ensure stable
operation at voltages mailman-S V. By changing
resistance R (for instance by mutation of the
external leads) we can regulate the supply current In
of the inJection :31 chips, providing the required
speed [Ref. 1, 1]. By adding resistor 3,, we can
stake the necessary change in supply current. and
hence in the speed of the separate stages of the
injection L81 chips. The permissible number of L81
stages in this case is x-(mn-umunwupm. For
Pig. 2 typical values: Elﬁn-10.5 V, Unanin'o-s V,
Ui.max"1'° V, we get k-h.

 

Thus in the case of series connection of injectors when transistor current
sources are used the loss factor K” decreases by a factor of k. reaching
ng ~l.2. As a result, switching factors close to the liniting values [Ref.
1, 2] can be actually realized in digital systens.

Active-passive supply mode. when this nethod is used, the supply currents
of the injection L8! chips vary during operation of the digital systen from

In to devices that are involved in data processing (Ref. 6].

me sources must have high speed for svitching current In to avoid reducing
the speed of the system. Control of the current sources is accomplished by a
special nicrocircuit that analyzes incoming cmands and feeds energizing
signals to the current supply sources of the devices that are taking part

in execution of these cos-ands. Several levels of current supply are
possible for executing cos-tends of different priorities.

In order to prevent the operation of supply activation fro- delaying the
solution of a problem. the control device can snalyse two successive
commie simultaneously so as to pre-energise the supply for the devices
required in executing the next con-and.

The controlling nicrocircuit may be an appropriately progranned permnent
menory, or a special supply-control microprocessor that will handle real-tine
redistribution of the supply current to the devices in the digital system

in accordance with the problem being solved.

Since only some of the circuits (usually no more than 101) are simultaneously
involved in data processing in digital system. the use of the active-passive
supply node in principle can give a switching factor for logic circuits that
is less than the liniting value given in Ref. 1. 2 by a factor of 1/9. where

p is the average percentage of circuits involved in processing at each
instant.

CONCLUSION

A further reduction in the switching factor of digital aicrocircuits based on
121. requires not only continued ilprovenent of manufacturing techniques, but

YOR OFFICIAL US! ONLY

also the solution of circuit design problems for optimum power supply orga-
nization. This means that research is needed in the following areas:

high-quality stable current supplies, including sources with short on-off
time;

high-speed I/O ntomimuits that can be used in staged energizing of
injection LSI chips;

microcimuits for supply control devices.

Development of the appropriate current supplies and I/O microcircuits

will permit a reduction even on the present stage by a factor of four in the
power consumption and accordingly in the switching factor of digital systems
based on injection mierocircuits.

Realization of the active-passive supply mode will enable a reduction in the
average switching factor for many types of digital systems by another
order of magnitude or more. To accomplish this. it is necessary first to
solve problems of structural organization of digital systems with active-
passlve supply mode, to define the class of problems where the use of such
a mode is most effective, and also to develop the corresponding software
for these systems. The use of this circuit-design technique for reducing
the switching factor is promising not only for I L microcircuits, but also
for other types of bipolar microcircuits. In this connection. the digital
systems that utilize microcircuits based on bipolar transistors have power
consumption approaching that of systems on complesentary mas transistors
while retaining a considerable advantage in speed.

[Text] An examination is made of the particulars of oper-
ation of an inJection-coupled quaaiatatic memory element
containing two p-n-p and two n-p-n transistors. The area
occupied by the memory cell is 2600 m2. recording time is
20 ns. and readout time is 10-20 ns. The results of machine
calculation and experimental research confirm the workability
and high energy characteristics of the memory cell.

Modern advances in development or bipolar circuits with 10 kbit dynamic
storage capacity [Rei‘. 1-2] or even more [Bet 3] are due primarily to the
development of a variety or masory cells (Mes) with inJection logic. At

the present time injection HCs have been used as the basis for both static
(Ref. 10] and dynamic (Ref. 5] integrated semiconductor storage circuit chips
(ISSCCs). However. in the latter case [Rat 5] the dynamic MC has only a
formal, outward appearance of the injection structure. and only in recording
the logical "1" does it operate in the state characteristic of inJection
circuits. A disadvantage of dynamic ISSCCs is the necessity for recon-
structing (regenerating) intonation after definite time intervals that

vary with ambient temperature. The known static inJection Mes contain at
least six transistors. Therefore a further increase in the information
capacity of static ISSCCs is possible only by improving technology or by
modiiying conventional HCs.

his paper examines an inJection MC that contains only four transistors

with combined diffusion regions. In all modes of operation except readout,
the described HC is a static unit. Destructive readout is possible; however,
with limitation of the duration of the readout operation. information is
self-restoring.

WORKING PRINCIPLE OF THE M3401“! CELL

The inJection flip-flop on which all static Mes are based requires four
transistors: two p-n-p and two n-p-n. If the emitters of current-setting
p-n-p transistors are split. the flip-flop can be used for high-speed data
recording [Ref. 6]. It turns out that current-setting p-n-p transistors
are also convenient for use in data readout. The electric circuit of an
injection MC of this type is shown in Fig.’ l.

Recording. To energize transistor T2, it is first necessary to switch off
transistor Tl. This is accomplished by the collector current of T1 flowing
through transistor T3. The current in line Pl at this tine is low or
nonexistent. Transistor Tl goes out of saturation, and the potential in
node 2 increases. Then transistor T2 is put into saturation by the base
current.

Readout. The Information signal during readout is provided by the magnitude
and direction of the current in the bit lines. which are due to the state

of the me. In the storage mode. charges Q1 and Q2 differ considerably. If
transistor T1 is energized. the collector Junction of transistor Tia is biased
in the forward direction. while the collector Junction of transistor T3 has
practically zero bias. iihen the supply is switched off (the emitter Junctions
or T3 and Th have reverse or zero biasing). capacitanees c. and 02 begin to
recharge. Capacitance C; will discharge through the forward-biased p-n
Junctions: the emitter Junction of transistor '1'). and the collector Junction
of transistor Th. which are combined in the chip structure. Besides.
capacitance c; will be charged through the collector Junction of T1.

A current due to charge in will flow through inversely connected transistor
Tia in bit line Pl. For the short times of the readout stage. the change

in readout current can be approximately evaluated by the formula

[Ref. 7]. 'ihere is practically no current in bit line P0. This difference
in currents is utilized to identify the state of the MC and to determine the
code of the stored information.

As will be shown below. readout of up to 100 ns duration does not lead to a
change in the state of the flip-flop. Such a time sement is completely
sufficient to ensure workability of the readout circuits and the entire
isscc in the dynamic readout mode. With transition to the storage mode.
equal currents are set in the emitters of transistors T3 and Th. the memory

Shown in Fig. l are diagrams of the inJection (a) and modified (b) quasistatic

the p-n-p transistors are made in a pocket insulated from the n-p-n tran-
sistors (Fig. lb). The base potential of transistors T3 and Th can be
controlled by line A2. which is more convenient for the readout mode than
with the inJection MC (Fig. la). However. let us note that the area of the
latter in much smaller.

value of Cnﬁa pF. 'ihe input capacitance of the memory cell can be reduced
by reducing the capacitance of the emitter-base Junction of the p-nop
transistor. 1!: do this, the "n* guard band" must be at a certain distance
from the emitter region of the p-n-p transistor. Oontrariwise. for n-p-n

Junction of transistor '11 is forward-biased during data readout. while the
emitter Junctions of the p—n-p transistors are reverse-biased, we can get

a readout signal with amplitude sufficient for a differential amplifier.

directions a relatively central direction of sea wave propagation. 'lhe

[Text] Academician Viktor Amazespovich Ambartsumyan. Hero of Socialist
Labor and President of ArmSSR Academy of Sciences. by ukase of the l’residlum
of the USSR Supreme Soviet dated 15 September 1918. was awarded the Order
of Lenin and his second gold Hammer and Sickle medal for outstanding services
in the development of Soviet science and in connection with his 70th birthday.

To mark the labor exploits of V. A. Ambartsumyan. Hero of Socialist Labor. a
bronze bust will be erected in his homeland.

V. A. Ambartsumysn is one of the fouiders of theoretical astrophysics in He
USSR. At the same time as the Dutch astronomer Zanstra he created a physical
theory of gaseous nebulae. being one of the first to draw attention to the
importance of nonstationary phenomena in space in understanding the processes
of stellar evolution: and developed methods for evaluating the loss of mass by
nonstationary stars anti novas. V. A. Ambartsumyan first showed the meaning
of stellar associations in solving the question of the origin of stars. thereby
solving one of the problems of modern stellar cosmogony. lie is credited with
the introduction in science of the concept of galactic nuclear activity.

The value of the VIOI'IOi of V. A. Ambartsumyan on the theory of transmission of
emission. especially the principle he formulated of invariance. has gone far
beyond the framework of astrophysics. These works formed the basis for

research into the phenomena of transmission in the most diverse fields of
science.

V. A. Ambnrtsumyan has given much attention to the training of scientific

personnel. Among his numerous pupils are members of USSR Academy of
Sciences and academics of sciences of Union reptblics.

[Article commemorating S. L. Soboiev‘s 70th birthday]

[Text] By ukase of the USSR Supreme Soviet dated 5 October 1978. for services
in development of Soviet science. training of scientific personnel. and on the
occasion of his 70th birthday. Sergey L'vovich Soboiev was awarded the Order
of the October Revolution.

The fundamental results obtained by Academician S. l. Sobolev, Hero of
Socialist Labor. had an exceptional effect on the development of mathematics.
At the very start of his creative activity. he ran a series of outstanding
experiments In theoretical and applied mathematical physics. The works of s.
L. Sobolev in the dynamic theory of elasticity. diffraction of flat waves and the
solution to the Cauchy problem for hyperbolic equations made his name a
household word among mathematicians.

Back in the 19303. for anticipating his time. S. L. Sobolev laid the foundations
for a new approach to the problem of mathematical physics. introducing the
concept of a generalized solution. generalized derivative. and generalized
function. The theory of generalized functions is today a necessary instrument
for all research connected with the solution of differential equations.

In the field of boundary problems for elliptical equations. s. L. Sobolev created
a new branch of functional analysis-the theory of embedding of functional
spaces. Research in this direction has now been intensively developed
throughout the world and has found various applications.

s. l. Sobolev's achievements in solving equations of small oscillations of a
rotating liquid led to profound results in the spectral theory of operators; his
work on the theory of eubattI-e formulas are recognized as a model of brilliant
solution of a mathematical problem.

[Article commemorating l. M. Frank's 70th birthday]

[Text] For services in developing Soviet science. training scientific personnel
and on the occasion of his 70th birthday. Academician il'ya Mikhaylovich Frank
was awarded the Order of the October Revolution by ukase of the Presidium of
the USSR Supreme soviet dated 20 October :978.

l. M. Prank arrived in science in a period of formation and violent development
of Soviet physics; his contribution to its remarkable achievements is ponderous
and many-faceted.

His works on explaining the nature of the "enigmatic" Vaviiov-Cherenkov
luminescence and further development of optics of charged particles. enriched
physics theory with new ideas. received world acclaim. and strengthened the
authority of Soviet science.

During the war and the first years thereafter. when the Motherland was occupied
with those problems. he took active part in solving the nuclear problem.
successfully carrying out a large problem of scientific research connected with
the establishment of Soviet nuclear reactors and the study of processes of
interaction of neutrons with matter. Dtrirg this period he developed
theoretically new methods of study which were later to receive wide dis-
semination.

Almost since the very start of his scientific activity. having shown interest
towards the then only just nascent nuclear physics. 1. M. Prank did much to

develop this field of knowledge and became one of the founders of domestic
science on the atomic nucleus.

BASIC TRENDS OP SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH 01’ THE ARMSSR ACADEMY OF
SCIENCES

Moscow VES'I‘NIK AN SSSR in Russian No 2. 1°79 pp 3-10
[Report by V. A. Ambartsumyan. president. ArmSSR Academy of Sciences]

[Text] At the end of 1978 the ArmSSR Academy of Sciences marked its 35th
anniversary. it now consists of so scientific institutions. including 28 institutes.
Over 7000 persons work in the academy. among these about 200 doctors of
sciences.

The Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences discussed the basic trends and
future of development of scientific research of the ArmSSR Academy of
Sciences. A report was read by V. A. Ambartsumyan. President of the ArmSSR
Academy of Sciences.

Report of V. A. Ambartsumyan

The basic mission facing the ArmSSR is defined in resolutions of the 25th Cl’SU
Congress. 28th ArmSSR 0? Congress. in addition to decrees of the CPSU
Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers on issues of further
development of industry and agriculture. In particular. in the republic it is
envisaged that there will be development of radio engineering industry.
instrument construction. machine tool construction. etc. These decisions will
greatly determine the trends of work of scientific organizations. Therefore the
ArmSSR Academy of Sciences has reconsidered its themes of scientific research.
More than 200 topics of on-going work are linked with specific problems of the
national economy.

The speaker noted that since its formation. the ArmSSR Academy of Sciences
has striven to have its own personality and in no way to be a miniaturized
version of the Academy of Sciences of the land. This principle has justified
itself in practice: more or less significant successes of ArmSSR Academy of
Sciences have been achieved wherever this has been done. Furthermore. the
speaker reported on some specific achievements and basic trends of scientific
research of the ArmSSR Academy of Sciences.

At the Institute of Mathematics. ArmSSR Academy of Sciences. important
results have been obtained in theory of functions. especially theory of complex
variable fixictions. These resilts led to great success in the theory of
approximations in complex fields.

interesting results have recently been attained in a modern section of ma-
thematics such as integral geometry. closely linked with the geometric theory of

probabilities.

v. A. Ambartsumyan mentioned that successes in integral geometry have been
attained due to the utilisation of combinatory methods on one hand. and certain
methods of mathematical physics. intensively developed by Armenian theo-
retical astrophysicists In solving problems of the theory of transfer of emission
on the other hand. '

The academy-based Yerevan institute of Mathematical Machines. based on the
initiative of Armenian mathematicians. is now engaged in work whose volume is
only slightly less than that of the academy as a whole. In addition. industrial
enterprises have been formed in the republic for the construction of computers.
The initiative of the academy has been very valuable here too.

The speaker noted shortcomings in the work of the academy's Computer Center
which has hardly tackled questions of computer mathematics. whereas computer
hardware will soon hold a visible place in the industry of the republic.

Greet achievements have marked the activity of the Byil'altan Astrophysical
Observatory. On the whole. the observatory is involved with problems of non-
stationary stars and extragalactic astronomy where the attention of scientists
has also been focused on non-stationary objects. Hmdreds of new flaring stars
in stellar clusters and associations. The Byte-alien Observatory holds first place
world-wide in the number of new flaring stars discovered. The role of flaring
stars has been shown to be one of the early stages in the evolution of most stars.
The question of the dependence of the amplitude-frequency characteristics of
flaring stars on other variables and on the age of the system in which they reside
has been formulated and partially resolved.

We know that prior to the middle 19603. the possibilities of extragaiactic
research in our comtry were limited due to the lack of powerful telescopes.
With the introduction of wide-angle telescopes of the Schmitt system with their
gigantic prisms at Byurakan. the situation has changed abruptly. In the past to
years. the Byte-alien Observatory has "monopolized" world research with the
discovery of galaxies having excess UV radiation in their spectrum: in the
literature this has become known as Markaryan galaxies. Out of 1200 galaxies of
this type which are of enormous scientific interest. over 90 percent were
discovered at Byurakan. Due to the work of this observatory. we now lmow of
about 10 times more Seifert galaxies with particularly active nuclei; this
permitted us to study the nature of these objects and establish their genesis
from quasars. New types of galactic systems have been discovered; only one of
them. Shakhbasyan-l. has an entire series of studies devoted to it in the world

literature. A new. large telescope with a mirror diameter of 2.6 meters recently
entered the structue of Bywakan (in the USSR its dimensions are only infe-

rior to the S-mcter telescope at Zelenchuk). The use of this telescope has
already led to new. interesting discoveries in the field of galactic nebulae. With
the aid of the telescope situated on the Soyuz-l: satellite. coworkers at
Byurakan have obtained UV spectra of very weak stars (of the 13th magnitude):
this Isignificantly sis-passes the results obtained in observations made from other
sate tea.

The Institute of Radiophysies and Electronics. ArmSSR Academy of Sciences.
achieved great success in developing highly-sensitive radiometric equipment: a
parametric amplifier for the 4 millimeter range and others was developed.
Methods for using polarized effects in precision SHP-phasometry have been
proposed. developed and implemented. Another important research trend at this
institute is the development of smell high-sensitivity photoelectric converters of
angular motion. The results of the institute's work have been very valuable in
space and natural resource research.

In addition to the institute of Radiophysics and Electronics. physics work is done
in Armenia at three large scientific centers: Yerevan Physics institute. Yerevan
University. and the ArmSSR Academy of Sciences institue of Physical Research.
One of the most significant successes of our physicists. the speaker noted. was
the development of a theory of transient emission with whose aid were studied
radiation processes. Monophoton nonlinear phenomena in gases were first
studied at the institute of Physical Research.

New crystals for laser electronics have been grown and studied at the institute:
a two-frequency ruby laser was created for the first time and a single-crystal
emerald was used in laser amplifiers of the millimeter range.

Armenia is a republic with a developed chemical industry; therefore chemical
scientists have always been valued in the academy. At the institue of Chemical

Physics. much emphasis is placed on research into the mechanics of chemical
reactions. A kinetic method for the accretion of radicals via freezing was
developed there. which permits the study of their behavior in concentrations.
This made it possible to study the mechanics of several oxidation and
decomposition reactions. A new effect of heterogeneous-catalytic decom-
position of peroxides into radicals. with partial transition of the radical into the
gaseous phase. was discovered. At the institute a new method was proposed for
producing especially pure heat-proof compounds: carbides. borides. silicides. and
nitrides. This is only part of the work on self-propagating high-temperature
synthesis. In collaboration with the USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of
Chemical Physics. technology was developed to produce molybdenum disilieide
that has been incorporated at the Kirovakan Plant of high-Temperature Heaters.

Several other studies are carried out by the institute at plants of the republic's
chemical industry.

At the institute of Fine and Organic Chemistry. more than one thousand new
substances are synthesized every two years to demonstrate the connection

between their chemical structure and their effect on the organism. A basic
practical goal is the search for new drugs to treat cardiovascular. nervous. and
mental diseases and against malignant neoplasms.

Based on the development of chemistry of non-limiting and heterocyclic
compounds. and the research and development of medicinal plants of local flora.
nine highly effective medicinal compounds have been introduced Into medical
practice.

Successful work has been done at the institute of Biochemistry. which specializes
in neurochemistry. Fundamental research into physiologically highly-active
neurohormones of the central nervous system has been done here: biologically
active peptides. metelwtaining proteins. and proteolipids. The discovery and
isolation of some new polypeptide hormones associated with the hypothalamus
should be noted. as well as the isolation of a coppercontaining protein called
neurocuprein from the grey and white cerebral matter. The institute has many
qualified personnel and has been able to establish broad international relations.

The institute of Microbiology has created a large collection of microbial
cultures. among which some toxins are represented by the richest collection of
strains in the country.

The institute of Agrochemical Problems and Hydroponics. one of the pioneers of
hydroponics in the Soviet Union. achieved significant results in industrial
hydroponic cultivation of aromatic geranium. medicinal plants. and ntrsery-

grown grapes.

Important research is being done at the institute of Botany and Botanical
Gardens on flora of Armenia: seven volumes of the lo-volume edition entitled
"Flora of Armenia" have already been published; an original theory of aging of
higher plants has been developed. Seven Hydrobiologicei Station has done great

work in studying the biological cycle and productivity of water ecosystems of
Lake Seven.

As a mountainous country. the work of geologists is of major value for Armenia.
In particular. the basic patterns of arrangement of major minerals have been
shown and theoretical foundations have been elaborated for their search.

Production of copper has existed for 100 years in Armenia. Due to the discovery
of copper and molybdenum deposits in the Soviet period. the production of
copper has not only expanded but the great production of molybdenum
concentrates has been organized as well. At the institute of Geological Sciences
research is being conducted on a high level into the metallogeny of Armenia;
more detailed metallogenic maps have been drawn up.

At the Institute of Geophysics and Engineering Seismology. a chronological
catalogue of earthquake feel and a cumulative catalogue of intense earthquake
foci in Armenia has been drawn up methods have been proposed and approved for
comprehensive geological and geophysical. soismologicsl and engineering-seis-
mological research to determine the seismic hazard of the construction sites of
nuclear electric power plants. But despite several interesting studies on
engineering seismology. the republic has still not highly developed seismologic
science capable of predicting earthquakes. its development is planned: ArmSSR
Academy of Sciences needs help from USSR Academy of Sciences.

The activity of ArmSSR Academy of Sciences in the social sciences is extremely
diverse. A large number of monographs on history. language. and art of Armenia
has been published. The institute of History created a fundamental eight-
volumc work “History of the Armenian People". in 1978 occurred the
sesquicentennial of East Armenia's federation with Russia. when the Armenian
people were saved from destruction. Works have been published on the
evaluation of historical meanirg of the trandtion to a new stage in the history
of the Armenian people. characterized by the gorwing collaboration with the
brotherly Russian people and other peoples forming the USSR. it is gratifying
to note that the most important place in historical research is occupied by works
on the Soviet period of Armenian history-a period of the ultimate blossoming
of all forms of its political. economic. and cuittral life.

An important. complex task is the scientific study of the future development of
the republic's national economy. Both industry and agriculture of Armenia are
multi-sectorial; thus the composition of economic predictions is not an easy task.
The first great step in this direction was taken in 1917 with the publication of
the institute of Economics' work "On Major Trends in Socioeconomic Deve-
lopment of the Republic Before 1990". This work has been presented to the
State Planning Committee and the leading organs of the republic.

The institute of Philosophy and Law. in addition to problems of history of
Armenian philosophy and other issues. is working intensively on a comprehensive
study of the mic-philosophical aspects of functioning and development of
science in the period of scientific and technical revolution. Over 40 monographs
and collections have been published on the subject.

The Institute of Archeology and Ethnography has conducted important work in
archeology. especially the excavation of such valuable historical treasures as the
Karmir-Blur. Erebuni. Artashst. Gerni. and so forth.

The institute of Literature imeni M. Abegyan created a five-volume "History of
Soviet Armenian Literature". Among the achievements of the Institute of

The speaker drew attention to the fact that the activity of the ArmSSR
Academy of Sciences does not strive to develop all disciplines but selects those
directions in which it can focm all efforts to achieve valuable results. Related
to such trends are. in mathematics. the theory of functions. integral geometry;
in astrophysics. non-stationary effects in outer space; in radiophysics and radio
engineering. the use of effects in the SH? range to solve concrete technical
problems; in chemistry. the study of mechanics of chemical reactions. synthesis
of new compomds; in biochemistry. neurochemistry.

Wherever this principle is not followed. indicated the speaker. in the scientific
activity of the institutes of the academy there are shortcomings. especially in
multiple themes which leads to the scattering of scientific efforts. Patent
licensing work is not being done actively enotgh. 'ihe productivity and quality
of scientific research work must be raised: it is to a great extent defined by the
qualification of scientific personnel. In this regard. Armenia has propitiom
horizons. since one-third of the scientific and scientific and tecimical workers of
the academy are under 30 years of age.

V. A. Ambartsumyan noted the acute problem of providing institutes with
scientific equipment. especially imported hardware. in resolving this problem.
great help could be rendered by the USSR Academy of Sciences. The limit of
subscriptions to foreign scientific iotrnals must also be increased.

The current computer pool of the ArmSSR Academy of Sciences Computer
Center does not meet modern requirements and does not permit the study of
systems programming nor the establishment of computer time-sharing for the
scientific institutions of the republic. The arrangement of test production is not
going well.

in conclusion. the speaker stressed that the activity of the institutes of the
ArmSSR Academy of Sciences. to a great degree. depends on interaction with
the corresponding institutions of the USSR Academy of Sciences. and also with
academies of sciences of brother republics. in particular. scientific ties were
recently intensified with the academics of sciences of Georgia and Azer

baydzhan.

V. A. Ambartsumyan expressed gratitude to the USSR Academy of Sciences
Commission which became deeply familiarized with the activity of the ArmSSR
Academy of Sciences activities and noted that advice and recommendations
made by the commission have already made significant contributions to the
scientific institutions of the ArmSSR Academy of Sciences.

A joint report was delivered by B. 8. Sokolov. chairman of the commission of the
Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences familiar with activity of the
ArmSSl't Academy of Sciences.

8. S. Sokolov emphasized that since its inception. the ArmSSlt Academy of
Sciences chose the completely proper path: it does not copy the activity of USSR
Academy of Sciences and other academies. but develops its own powerful
aspects. The ArmSSli Academy of Sciences. therefore. now represents an
original scientific organization with great achievements.

A scientiﬁc center of world renown. the Byts-akan Observatory. conducts unique
astrophysical research. Armenia has had its own. long known mathematical
school. Research of Armenian scholars in the field of radiophysics of superhigh
frequencies occupies a firm place in modern science. Research in physical
chemistry offers exceeding interest.

Great deposits of minerals exist in Armenia; a detailed plan of assimilation
ofneturai resources has been drawn up. Work is now being intensively done in
engineering seismolcgy.

Research done by Armenian scientists in neurophysiology and neurochemistry is
at the forefront in our country.

Very valuable experience has been gained thrown ruearch of bioeenoses and
adjustment of the ecosystems of Lake Seven because of steps taken there to
develop the republic's energy. A unique biological and geographical object like
Seven is becoming a natural model for important research by the State: the
results should be considered when similar steps are organised for Baykal and
other regions.

in many scientific trends. Armenian scientists have achieved great successes and
practical works which have been incorporated into production.

However. noted 8. S. Sokolov. at some institutes of the republic's Academy of
Sciences efforts are inadequately concentrated on the main trends of research.
small topics are retained. and qualified personnel are hard to get. The computer
pool of the Computer Center needs renewal. Some institutes do not have enough
modern equipment. Arrangement of the Library of the ArmSSR Academy of
Sciences for the Geological Mmeum with its mique collection is not proceeding
satisfactorily. Serious attention mint be paid to the construction of new sites
for the institutes.

in conclmion. B. S. Sckclov noted that party and council leadership of the
republic is attentively relating to the needs of the Academy of Sciences and is
promoting the development of science in Armenia.

State Prize in 1978.

A large series of studies on the propagation of laser emission in the atmosphere
has been completed. Data were obtained on the major optical characteristics oi
air-borne particles and statistical patterns of variation were revealed.

A study of twilight effects and observation data from spacecraft were used to
develop methods of optical sensing of the high layers of the atmosphere. Based
on measurements of reﬂected and inherent emission of the Barth's surface and
atmosphere in the visible and lit ranges from Earth satellites Kosmos-MB. -
243. -320 and 484. methods of remote analysis were designed for some
geographical parameters of the atmosphere. Data obtained with these methods
have been used to study Barth's natural resources using aerowace techniques.

A spectroscopic devices was designed and expeditionary measirements of small
impurities throughout the atmosphere were analyzed.

The study of natural resets-cos and the environment were recently expanded
significantly. Publication is completed of 14 monographs in the series "Natural
Conditions and Resources of the USSR"; the monograph "Resources of the
Biosphere in the Territory of the USSR: Scientific Bases of Rational Use and
Conservation" was published.

A plan was developed to form a Baykal Nature Conservation Zone; tentative
prognosis of a change in the environment of the Aral Sea has been made; a
system has been proposed for measures to transform and utilize the swamps of
Western Siberia. .

Using modern geophysical methods. a comprehensive study is being made of the
natural ecosystems and anthropogenic transformation. including a comprehensive
program of CMBA and the Interltosmos Program.

The modern dynamics of glaciers has been studied; a prognosis of evolution of

The Division of Oceanoloﬂy. Atmospheric Physics. and Geography concentrates
its work on the solution of fundamental scientific problems. giving particular

meaning to problems which are important to the economic development of our
country.

One of the chief achievements in oceanology was the discovery in the ocean by
the Polygon-70 expedition from the Institute of Oceanology of meso-scale eddies
(on the order of hundreds of kilometers in size) in which the primary energy of
oceanic flows is concentrated. This discovery. confirmed by the data of other
experiments. radically altered the then eta-rent notion about flows in the ocean.

With the aid of hydrophysicai probes of increased resolution designed at the
Institute of Oceanology. an evolved. delicate vertical structue of the ocean was
detected and its universal prevalence was established.

A global numerical model of ocean and atmosphere interaction was elaborated
it theoretically possible to simulate the climate. The 'h‘opeks-n (Tropical
Experiment) and ATRP-‘M (Atlantic 'h‘opical Experiment) were carried out with
wide and comprehensive studies of atmospheric and oceanic interaction.

A specially designed device was used to study petroleum contamination of the
world's oceans. Dispersants have been developed to remove the petroleum film.
Natural tests of three sorbents were successful. .'l‘hese agents were highly
effective In cleaning the port landing area of petroleum. masut. and diesel fuel
films.

Numerous data on the geology of oceans were first reflected on maps of bed
sediments of the world's oceans. mineralogical charts. geochemical. sediment
physical property and other charts.

A large cycle of research work on iron-manganwe concretions at the ocean
bottom and of fields of propagation of metal-bearing sediments is completed.

An important theoretical assumption was advanced on the optimum zones of
petroleum and gas formation in landing areas as the largest foci of natural
generation of different praised systems of hydrocarbons under the specific
circumstances of an ocean-type sedimentary layer. New shelf and sea areas
have shown promise of petroleum and gas content. Data have been obtained on
the relief of the crystalline foundation and structure of the sedimentary cover
beneath the landing area of the Middle Caspian; these data permitted
recommendations to be made for petroleum and gas prospecting work.

Much attention was given to studying of distributive features of biological zones
in the ocean. Mathematical models of the function of biological communities of
the pelagic zone were constructed. A structural-{metional analysis of biological
communities was done of the most powerful bioproductive systems of the world

ocean: the production of biological communities. their individual trophic levels
and groups was evaluated.

A geomorphologie commission coordinated research on vital scientific problems
"Surfaces of Planation and Weathering Crust of the USSR" and "Modern Tectonic
Movements."

A great deal of attention has been given to studying the productive foreu of
Siberia. questions of efficient utilization. conservation. and reproduction of
natural resources. geographic rationale for future development of regions on the
RAM route. Patterns of formation of the population have been revealed in
regions of new assimilation in Siberia. A prognosis was developed for population
dynamics in this region.

Using materials from the Far Bast. methods of geographic prognosis have been
developed for environmental change due to the paleoclimate on the global scale.
Patterns of transformation have been established for teehnogenlc matter due to
the complex of mining enterprises in the humid climate of the Seacoast.
Detailed economic regionalization of the eastern portion of the RAM zone has
been implemented.

Ecosystems in the cha Basin have been studied. As as result of these studies
a prognosis was made for change in ecosystems affected by the Zeya reservoir.

Scientific foundations have been developed for controlling water resources of the
country. Research has been done on processes of global and regional moisture
exchange. Methods have been designed to determine the water content in the
atmosphere. snow. and soils: methods were proposed for evaluating the amount
of precipitation based on satellite data.

A map of the underground runoff of our country has been drawn up and was
evaluated in the world water balance. Methods of regional evaluation of
resources of subterranean water were designed for problems of the General Plan
of Comprehensive Utilization and Conservation of Water Resourt :s of the USSR.
Work is complete on the quantitative evaluation of subterranean runoff into the
world ocean under diverse natural conditions.

Foundations of a theory of control of river runoff and fluctuation in the level
of closed basins have been elaborated; a mathematical model of the complex
water management system has been designed; the possibility of maintaining
favorable conditions of the Caspian Sea level with significant economy of water
fed from other basins has been substantiated.

A prediction of possible changes until 1990 in water quality of the lvan'ko
Reservoir--a primary source of water supply of Moscow-has been drawn up. A
prediction of change in the biological and chemical conditions of lakes in the
Northwest European territory of the Soviet Union and the Karelian Peninsula was
written in connection with transfer of some of the runoff to the south.
Research has been done on predicting water quality and overgrowth of
reservoirs in various regions of the country (including the RAM region).

A large amount of work has been done in the field of geocryology. Monographic
descriptions have been written of geoeryologic conditions of mountain regions of
Siberia and Yakutiya. The maximum thickness of rock cooled below 0 degrees
Celsius on the Earth has been established. A considerable discontinuity of
frozen layers was found in the mountainous part of our country's northeast. in
conjunction with USSR State Committee for Construction, a geocryelogic map of
the Soviet Union was drawn up. Geocryologie conditions of the territory of
Mongolia were investigated and a geocryologic map was composed. A map was
drawn of the cryogeomorphologic regionalization of Siberia and the Far East.

In collaboration with sector organizations. engineering and biologic natural
conservation recommendations have been made for the region of construction
and exploitation of structures. extraction and transportation of gas in northern

in concluding the speaker touched upon the scientific and organizational activity
of the Division of Oceanology. Atmospheric Physics. and Geography. A general
meeting of the division regularly hears reports on major scientific achievements.
institute reports on their scientific activity. reports on vital problems of modern
science.

It considerable place in the work of the division is occupied by the organization
of scientific sessions. Sessions run by the division were devoted to global
research of the atmosphere and weather prediction; prediction of the con-
sequences of human actions on the environment; the study of natural resources
of the Komi ASSit; acoustics of the ocean and hydrophysics; new methods of
studying ocean waters. atmomheric processes. relief of the dry land. natural
water and glaciers. problems of the country's water balance; remote sensing of
the environment from space; problems of solarsground links. etc. The session
devoted to climatic problems is worthy of special note. it was called by the
division in 1977 in conjunction with the USSR State Committee on Hydro-
meteorlogy and Environmental Control. USSR Academy of Sciences Scientific
Committee on the Problem "Weather Prediction". and the USSR Academy of
Sciences Scientific Council on Problems of the Biosphere. At the session

summaries of research into the genesis and prognosis of the climate were given
and recommendations were made for further development of this research. .

The division took an active part in elaborating the Comprehensive Program of
Scientific and Technical Progress and its socioeconomic consequences for 1978-

1990. and scientific and technical prognosis of efficient utilization and
conservation of water resources mtil 2000.

Especially important scientific and technical issues were covered by special
meetings of the division bureau. The bureau also discussed questions of
development of creative collaboration of scientific institutions of the division
with production and acceleration of incorporation of results of scientific
developments; it discussed steps toward further improvement of higher education
in its profile. means of expanding ties with scientific institutions of the USSR
Ministry of Education. compulsory and extracurricular institutions. Questions of
training scientific personnel are regularly examined at buream meetings.

The division devotes much attention to multilateral cooperation with academies
of sciences of the socialist countries on the comprehensive program "Planetary
Geophysical Research." the state of work on the PIGAP program (program of
study of global atmospheric processes). activity of the Coordination Center of
the Institute of Oceanology on the problem of member countries of CMEA
"Study of Chemical. Physical. Biological. and Other Process of Major regions of
the World Ocean and Development~of Modern Technical Means for Efficient
Study and Mastery of its Resources."

Stressing the successful development of scientific disciplines related to the
division's competency. the speaker noted problems which division institutions
have encountered due to the lack of necessary equipment. modern technical

means for expeditionary research, work sites. and scientific personnel. especially
in several new specializations.

Discussion of the Report

Academician V. V. Shuleykin touched on the problem of long~term weather
predictions which. he feels. does not receive due attention from the Academy of
Sciences. In studying this problem. he said. scientific policies must be
completely altered. No matter how perfect the differential equations written by
the experts are. they are not effective if they are integrated without considering
boundary conditions. Boundary conditions. however. can not be considered since
we do not know them: we have no continuous data about what goes on on the
surface of the world ocean. Furthermore. to solve this problem. research of the
ocean's waters must be carried out in continuous association with research of
atmospheric physics.

K. Ya. Kondrct'ycv. Correspondlgf Member of USSR Academy of Sciences.
noted that the formation of the vision of Occanoiogy. Atmospheric Physics.
and Geography in the Academy of Sciences promoted the more effective
development of these major sections of Earth science. in the to years since the
organization of the division. however. scientific problems have arisen. especially
in the study of the environment and natural resources. These new problems are
difficult to solve using the same efforts which the division new has available.
For example. this is the problem with the climate which has long since been
the subject not only of physics and chemistry. but of blegeophyslcs as well. It
is quite clear that without a study of various interacting processes occurring in
organic and inorganic nature. there is no chance of answering the question of
why and how the climate changes. K. Ya. Kondrat'yev agreed with V. V.
Shuleykln on the importance of considering boundary conditions in long-term
weather forecasts. in fact. he said. it is not enough to me initial data alone
for a forecast.

it is now impossible to tell with certainty what is happening with the climate.
mainly because there is not enough factual data for the entire globe. This data
should mainly be obtained by satellites. Thus satellite climatology becomes
extremely important. Research of the weather and climate on other planets is
extremely important to understand the patterns of the Earth's climate: close
contacts must be maintained with astrophysicists for this reason.

The make-up of the division should more fully correspond with the new problems.
More efficient mechanisms and forms of scientific cooperation are needed. In
particular. an interdisciplinary program on the climate is needed which could
unite members of various scientific trends and form a united front of research.
which does not yet exist. Furthermore. and this concerns not only the problem
of the climate. the division should more broadly coordinate research in its
profile throughout the entire country.

Yu. A. lzrael'. Corresponding Member of USSR Academy of Sciences. cha-
ractcrized the problems which face scientists in solving problems of long-term
weather forecasting and climatic change. as well as the study of the geophysical
aspects of ecology.

in research on hydrometeorology associated with solving the problem of long-
term weather forecasting. he said. Soviet experts are actively collaborating with
scientists of all countries. The i’iGAP program is an example of this
collaboration. Work in this program should give valuable data for improving
methods of long-term weather forecasts.

A program associated with long-term weather forecasts continues to be formed.
This problem requires special attention. Soviet scientists are doing a lot of
work in weather forecasting. The ideas of Academician G. l. Marehuk on long-
term prediction are very interesting. But in addition to these ideas and plans.
it good system of observations is necessary. a system of data production which
could be used to implement these ideas and plans. Therefore. another important
problem is the creation of a continuous system of global meteorological
surveying in which a great role should be given to aerospace observation
systems. Consequently. a more rapid creation of a geostationary meteorologic
satellite is becoming more and more important.

Closely allied with work on long-term weather prediction is worlt on climate
study. it is still impossible to accurately describe the climate even for the near
future. and our future depends heavily on this. On the suggestion of scientists
of USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR State Committee on Hydro-
meteorology and Environmental Control. it was decided to create a national
Soviet program on climate studies. This program will unite various forms of
research into a unified front. '

As concerns the contribution of the Division of Oceanoiogy. Atmospheric
Physics. and Geography to the problem of environmental protection. it is mainly
linked with solving a series of ecological questions. Cooperation has been
arranged between institutions of USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR State
Committee on Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control. Hopefully it could
be even closer.

Academician A. M. Obukhov emphasised that the Division of Oceanoiogy.
Atmospheric Physics. and Geography had significantly promoted a rise in the
overall level of scientific research in its pertinent fields. Division sessions
generally are creative and stimulate the use of new atmospheric and oceano-
graphic research methods. The use of fine methods of spectroscopy to indicate
atmospheric impurities. the use of natural thermal emission in the SHF range
in problems of "aerospace geography" and oceanology could be given as
examples. Furthermore. the division could play a greater role in thawing the
attention of scientists working on fundamental problems to the practical needs
of various agencies. This Is especially germane for atmospheric physics.

Academician A. V. Sidorenlro stated that when the Division of Oceanology.
Atmospheric Physics. and Geography had just been formed there was insufficient
attention given to its strengthenim. The resources of some institutions in the
division did not correspond to new problems. This is still the situation with the
Institute of Geography. institute of Limnology. The Imtitute of Water Problems
also was in a complex situation for a long time: it had basically been formed
only on paper. Thus now primary attention must be given to reinforcirg the
material and technical base of the institutes.

It is very important to intensify the role of the division both in the coordination
of research being conducted by institutions of the USSR Academy of Sciences
and republic academies as well as in coordinating interdisciplinary and
intcrugency research. This will aid in more clearly defining the general line of
division activities.

Academician i. P. Gerasimov spoke of the need to strengthen the material and
technical base of institutes. especially the Institute of Geography. whose
resources do not correspond to problems which it has to solve at today's level
of geographic science. He also touched on the question of drawing up a program
of fundamental research. in our division. he stated. we should develop or
modernize programs to study the world oceans. climate. and the environment.
An environmental program should be comprehensive and include biological.
geographic. eronomic.and sociological research-

A. I’. 'l‘reshnikov. Corresponding Member USSR Academy of Sciences. noted that
the Arctic and Antarctic play a deciding role in shaping weather. and the study
of these regions of the globe is very important in making forecasts. The USSR
Academy of Sciences has an lnteragency Commission on the Study of the
Antarctic. There is no coordinating unit for arctic research. but one is needed.
Various agencies of our comtry are now working in the polar region. including
the Arctic Ocean. But this work is not coordinated. there is no general line. no
strictly scientific basis. Perhaps it is not only a coordinating mlt which is
necessary. but a scientific research organization on questions of the Arctic.

Academician A. P. Aieksandrov. president of the USSR Academy of Sciences
noted the nced for creating climate programs which would include research

connected with the design of means of climate control. as well as work on the
paleoclimate.

Resolution

The Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences approved the activities of the
Division of OecanolOsY. Atmospheric Physics. and Geography of the USSR
Academy of Sciences.

The chief task of scientific institutions of the division is the conduct of research
on natural processes in the water and air envelopes and on the dry land of Earth
using the latest methods and means with the goal of effective use and protection
of resources and forecasting their evolution.

In the future the scientific and research work of the institutes of the division
will be concentrated in the following areas:

the study of physical. chemical. biological. and geological processes in the
world ocean and its sees; the study of the interaction of ocean, dry land and
atmosphere to ﬁnd means of efficient utilization of resources and to ensure
long-term weather forecasts; development of scientific means of prevention of

Snedkov. izd-vo "Svyaz"'. 1,300 copies. 128 pages. with illustrations]

[Text] Possibilities for using resonantly accelerated electron beams in
transmitter elements are described. The book provides calculations of
current pulses in bunchers and methods of electron resonant acceleration.
basic attention is placed on examination of transmitter element operating
principles and their designed features are also examined.

The book is intended for engineering and technical workers who do the
project planning of transmitters.

Forward

Type ”0" and ”H" electroVacuum instruments are being used in high-power
microwave transmitters' Lav [travelling wave tube]. klystrons. and magnetrons.
At the present time specific rules for the construction of transmitter circuits
as well as rules for the elaboration of electronic instruments which have now
become classic have been laid down. The capabilities of the classic circuits
do not always satisfy the growing requirements of modern communications equip-
ment:- Therefore. the nether has for several years directed his efforts at
creation of the theory of new transmitter hybrid circuits using the elements
of tuned amplifiers and the elements of floating-tube klystrons. The hybrid
devices possess special energy characteristics and their analysis is undoubtedly
of interest to readers.

Examined in Chapter 1 are possibilities for using resonantly accelerated
electron beams in transmitter elements. A theoretically new approach is beim
used-m generator with an external excitation is looked upon as a stage to
which, along with a dc source. is fed an auxiliary BF feed source, which
materially increases the kinetic energy of the electron beam. Practice has

shown that the electron beams must possess a relatively homogeneous energy
in order to obtain highly effective hybrid devices.

Chapter 2. sets down a method of calculating current pulses in bunchers,
which makes it easy to find the energy and time characteristics of the
electron clusters. Using these characteristics. examined in Chapter 3

are the circuits or the tuned electron amplifiers with monoenergetic beams.
Such amplifiers are input as an integral part to the generators with exter-
nal excitation but. in a number of instances. they can also accomplish
independent tasks.

Described in Chapters 4. and S are specific devicesl electronic antennas.

phase inverters, microwave power switches. frequency amplifier and multiplier
stages. and circuits of transmitting devices with accumulation of microwave
energy in resonant systems. however. the devices examined do not exhaust all
the mssible advantages of resonant acceleration. Also described in Chapter lo
are several elements of the transmission channel which controls the bunched
beams. Here the accent is placed on the capability of transmission of the
microwave energy which carries information about the usable signal by an
electron beau. Examined in Chapter 5 are the transmitter elements using
bunched beams. and attention is also concentrated on the potential capabilities
or accumulating the microwave power in the generator‘s oscillation system and
in its electron beam. The design features of the transmitters are discussed

in Chapter 6.

The principle of resonant acceleration has been known for a long time and is
being widely used in charged particle accelerators. Clear concepts exist on

the elaboration and tuning of resonant and waveguide acceleration systems.
Particle accelerators are used in high-energy devices. the category to which

the output stages of microwave transmitters belong. Nonetheless. resonantly
accelerated electron beams are used in transit-uter elements only under laboratory
conditions now.

The purpose of this book is to familiarise readers with the varied possibilities
of using resonantly accelerated beams in transmitted elements using clear
examples. Specific calculations of the circuits examined have been reduced.

it seems to me, to the most interesting practical point of View.

it” readers in their practical activities can use the principles of circuit
construction and methods for computing them presented in the book. the author
will consider that the job has been accomplished.

The author is obliged to thank his teachers and tutors--Docent c. l. Zhileyko

and Professor 8. l. Yevtyanov (deceased). who through their advice predetermined
the direction the book took.

The author expresses appreciation to readers who participate in discussing the
