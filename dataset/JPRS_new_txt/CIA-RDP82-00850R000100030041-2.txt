HATCNEO SURFACE ACOUSTIC HAVE FILTER FOR LOW TRANSMISSION RATES
Moscow ELEKTROSVYAZ' in Russian No 11. 1978 pp 58-61
[Article by A. Ye. Znamenskiy and Ye. s. Hurator]

[Text] An optimal receiver for relative phase transmissions contains a
filter matched to basebaad or radio-frequency pulses.

Filters matched to baseband pulses for low transmission rates R- Suez: kbaud
are made using active RC networks (hybrid construction) while those corres-
ponding to high rates It? llbaud are made using miniature lunped parameter
multitapped delay lines.

In many cases equipment size is smaller and receiver circuitry is simpler.
while its specifications are better when rf pulse-matched filters are used
instead of basebsnd matched filters.

Surface acoustic wave (SAW) device technology is widely used in construction
of rf pulse matched filters [1. 2, 3]. The advantages of SA" technology is
fully evident at information transmission rates exceeding R-Zonw30 kbaud.
The lower limit for these rates is defined by two factors: 1) permissible
temperature deviation of the center frequency of the most stable (with re-
spect to temperature) piers-electric element (ST-cut of quartz at 40‘ t
:§+50°C). and also 2) the actual dimensions of the working matched filter
as will be shown.

SAH devices are highly stable in a wide temperature range. a fact which is
very important at low information transmission rates, their manufacturing
technology is highly developed. they are very reliable and small in size as
compared with the dimensions of series 153, 155, and 157 microcircuits.

The SAN filter structure is shown in Fig l where l) is an acoustic guide;

2) is an interdlgltal transducer (IOT): 3) is a wideband IDT; 6) is an
nhsnrhlng layer. As we know the filter's amplitude-frequency charactertistic
ac.) and Its pulse response h(t) are related by an inverse Fourier transform:

Moreover. there exists a singular relationship between the pulse response h(t)
and the shape of the envelope of the II) electrodes. Electrodes are position-
ed at 'r - l/Zf. intervals along the acoustic guide. and the electrode length
is: proportional to Mt) at the corresponding reference point?“ (see Fig 1).

In general. during cslculations involving h(t) it is also necessary to in-
clude the asplitude—Erequency characteristic of a second 101'

“conundrum. (2)

As a rule. in practice the second 101' has a such wider bandwidth so that
the resultant aptitude-frequency characteristic is sainly defined by a
single narrow-band transducer. i.e. “(9) =5 “1(a).

Pro- this assumption it follows that the desired pulas response h(t) is fully
defined by the shape of the envelope of the distributed transducer electrodes.

The greatest difficulties are encountered during manufacture of 8M! filters
at the lower end of realizable transnission rates (R - 20~30 ltbaud). 'lhe
snplitude-frequency response of a filter notched to s rectangular pulse is
“(a-I) - Sin X]: where the pulse width is defined as:

1-1/R. (3)

Since a reduction of R leads to an increase in the transducer length l;

1 -:v where v is the velocity of propagation of the surface wave in the
acoustic guide. Thus. for R - 25 kbaud where v - 3.158 u/usec in an ST-cut
quartz 13126 I. If we consider that the acoustic guide mat be even
longer by about 20~30 as. then it is evident that such s filter is not an
opti-un one.

A second deficiency of the filter shown in Fig l is the difficulty of tuning
a center frequency with high accuracy. It is shown that the velocity devia-
tion in quarts acoustic guides is on the order of 10“. Pros the above it
is clear that even if deviations involved during filter nanufacture are ex-
cluded. it is very difficult to obtain the required accuracy for f. at low
trons-ission rates. Although nethods used for tuning are known [‘1 these
were carried out on seall-size acoustic guides (i.e. for those used in high
transmission rates). The method of applying a unifors-thicknass setslized
layer over the entire acoustic structure and the aging of this layer remains
questionable.

A scthod is described below for saking notched filters for low transnission
rates which penits a reduction in the length of the acoustic guide by a
factor of 2 and which allows for tuning the filter's center frequency while
using relatively sinple Ianufacturing lethods.

frequency. This is accouplished by changing the distance ’CIZ between trans-
ducer sections in the mob portion of the filter at the expense of increasing
or decreasing the propagation velocity of the SA" in this region. It is
known that the presence of a netalised layer in the propagation path of a

SAH changes its velocity [6]. has, if a section of a continuously setsl-
ized layer between transducer sections is reloved or deposited (see Fig 2)

it is possible to vary the center frequency of the main anplitude-frequency

of the latched filter with R - 2/? . Corresponding alplitude-frequency
characteristics are shown in Pig 3 where l) is the aaplitude-frequency
characteristic of the satched filter for rate equal to 2k; 2) is the sapli-
tude-frequency characteristic of the coab filter before returning: 3) is the
amplitude-frequency characteristic of the coab filter after retuning.

This method of frequency tuning is not optiasl because of a certain assynetry
of side lobes. But. since the principal portion of the signal energy is con-
centrated in the center lobe it is more important to tune to the center fre-
quency even at the expense of a certain deviation in the level of sidelobes

froa the design values in the range of 1 Mb. a fact which was confined ex-
perinentally.

It is noted that the formulas used for synthesis of satched filters cited
here do not include the finite length of small electrodes. i.e. wideband
transducers in the two-section structure. This is deelsed pernissible where

decreasing R. In order to reduce these effects it is necessary to introduce
cnrrectlnns in the trnnsducer aperture and to utilize a construction with.
split electrodes. and nlso to consider the asplitude-frequancy characteris-
tics of the electrics]. circuits on the filter's input and output.

dicated that the dieens ons of the filter are optiasl if one of its parts

is node using s two-section structure (for R - 64 ltbsud rate) and the
second - using a single section (for Itl . 253 baud rate) with subsequent
positioning of both parts on s single coustic guide (Pig 1.).

The filter was constructed using s themlly stable SR-cut quart: piste

etching techniques on chemically deposited silver 0.1.sgthiclt. Aperture of

[Article by V. V. Karavayev and V. V. Sazonov: ”0n the Theory of Non-Coherent
Detection"]

[Text] The use of phased transmitting antenna arrays has several shortcomings
in scanning space. Some of these shortcomings are as follows: energy dissipation
in shaping a coherent probe signal in each element oi the active array, and
concentration oi the beam to intensify emissivity due to increased antenna
dimrnsions. In order to surmount these shortcomings. in [i] it was proposed to
drop the phasing of individual elements oi the transmitting array. avoid emitting
signals with dilierent (perhaps, random) modulation relationships: but coherent
processing oi the received signal was do be done with the aid of a set oi
reference signals generated for each angular bearing by a special device based on
known or measured time relationships oi amplitudes and phases oi excitation oi
each emitter. Modulation oi probe signals is needed to suppress gaps in
transmitter directionality in non-cophase power conditions. A deficiency in this
arrangement is the complex nature of producing a set of adjustable matching
filters. Consequently. it is worth considering the characteristics of a system
which does not employ time-matched filtration of an incoming noise signal
(replacing it with band filtration)._ We shall demonstrate that with an optimum
selection of system parameters. power losses due to noncoherent processing are
not great.

II the transmitting antenna array is not phas '. scintillation oi the target can be
suppressed by separation oi the transmitters. Two versions of a transmitting
system design will be examined below, diiiering in the manner oi separation of
the probe signal. In the first version, several spatially-sepatated transmitters are
employed which simultaneously irradiate the target at diiierent angles. In the
screw version. the transmitters are superposed, but a multiple frequency probe
signal is utilized. Formulation of this oblem here diiiers from that usually
found in the literature (ci., for example. all in' that the incoming signal here has
double modulation with different inherent times, occurring as a result oi the
random field oi the transmitter and coefficient of reflection of the target.

To suppress fluctuations of a Rayleigh target, this system utilizes frequency
retuning of the signal from Impulse to impulse. Processing consists of band
filtration of each frequency channel. square-law memory of signal duration and

memory of frequency channels.

The figures presented show that lust as In the case of three-dimensional
separation. with increase m (to: given n) losses in ,1. for D ,>..o.s at first
decrease and then grow. But this elfect is manifested more sharply. It is
associated with the fact that the quantity of noncoherently stored discrete units
with frequency separation is equal to mn. whereas in three-dimensional
separation it is equal to m. Consequently. in the first case, due to noncoherent
storage, losses being to show at much lower values of m. Accordingly, optimum
values of m lie between one to two (versus 5 to 10 for three-dimensional
separation), and losses are slightly higher (by 0.5 to l dB).

CONCLUSION

The characteristics of detection of a Rayleigh target by radar location are
examined: there is no phasing of components of the transmitting system. For the
case ol great three-dimensional separation of transmitters, analytical ex~
pressions are obtained which describe the characteristics of detection. For the
case of frequency separation the appropriate formulas are derived in quad-
ratures. and calculation of characteristics of detection was done by the method
ol mathematical simulation.

it was found that with optimum selection ol the band of a random probe signal
and number of branches of separation. abandonment ol the use 0! phasing does
not lead to substantial losses in the signal-to-nolse ratio. According to the
probability of detection. they range from 0.5 to 3 d8. A system with three-
dimensional separation has minimal losses.

The authors express their gratitude to l. G. Korobkova, who performed the
calculations on computer.

[Article by I. Ya. Kramer and G. s. Nakhmansont "On the Potential Accuracy oi
Estimating Range and Angular Coordinate oi a Target with Signal Reception by
an Antenna Array in the General Case")

[Text I INTRODUCTION

The primary current assumptions oi the theory oi time-space processing oi
signals Ill, 2] are valid ior arbitrary time-space signals. But speciiic results in
the literature have mainly been obtained as they apply to the special case where
the wave ironts oi signals can be considered ﬂat. i.e., the signal sources are in
the remote zone oi the receiving antenna. It the signal source is situated in the
Fresnel zone oi the receiving antenna. an estimate of the parameters oi time-
space signals has substantial peculiarities associated with the curvature oi the
signal wave iront. These distinctive aspects have been investigated in studies
ll, 2. 6] as they apply to antennas with continuous linear apertures.

in this article the potential accuracy oi estimates oi range and angular position
oi a target are considered ior reception oi signals by an antenna array in the
general case. which includes positioning oi the target both in a remote zone and
in a Fresnel zone. The rise in potential accuracy oi range analysis owing to
consideration oi signal wave iront curvature is analyzed as a iunction oi the
number oi array elements. The ambiguity oi range measuement is considered
ior reception in "widely spaced” arrays and conditions to eliminate this problem
are discussed.

ii antenna aperture size to tw ce the distance to the target). The curves are
constructed under the premise that the signal-to-noise ratio remains constant.

The solid curves correspond to the arrival angle 00 = 0. while the dotted curves
are 9 = 20°. Figure 2 indicates that the gain in measurement accuracy oi target
range as 0- increases is proportional: this may be explained by the increased
curvature oi the iront oi the incident wave when the target approaches the
receiving antenna. This gain increases with a decrease in Go and the parameter
oi wide bandwidth F as well. The ratio oi estimate dispersion oi target range
with optimum space and time processing oi signals by an antenna array containing
Zinil receiving elements, to the estimate dispersion oi range ior signal processing
in a continuous aperture oi the same size ior various values oi parameters f and
in as a iunction oi as is shown in Figure 3. Analysis oi curves in Figures 2 and
3 shows that with constant dimensions oi an antenna system and identical va-

lnes ni signal-to-noise ratio 00. a reduction in the number oi receiving elements
leads to an increase in accuracy oi range measurement!

' in practice. ‘W condition 0'! sameness 00 may be ignored: the signal-to-noise
ratio may be reduced with a reduction in the number oi receiving elements
(2min. in this case a reduction in accuracy caused by reduced 00 is. to some

extent. equalized by raising accuracy as a result oi a reduction in m shown
in Figures 2 and 3.

When distances between antenna elements eitCeed the wavelength. ambiguity oi
range measurement by wave iront curvature may occur. This ambiguity may be
eliminated with combined measurement at range in terms oi delay time and in
terms oi its wave iront curvature. For this purpose. the signal spectrum width
should be such that in measuring range by delay time of a signal. the magnitude
oi the resolution interval does not exceed the magnitude oi interval oi an
unambiguous determination of range according to wave iront curvature.

Let us determine the relationship oi the required signal spectrum width as a
lunction oi antenna parameters and distance to target.

From equation (22) it is clear that ior given antenna dimensions. the required

value Ai/io is inversely proportional to the number oi receiving elements and the
range.

Let us examine the eiiect oi slgnal wave iront curvature and antenna aperture
discreteness on the potential accuracy oi measurement oi the target's angular
coordinate. in Figure (i is shown the ratio oi (Salk/din" oi estimate

oi estimating range. with given antenna system dimensions and identical values oi
signal-to-noise ratio. accuracy oi measurement oi the target's angular coordinate
increase as the number oi receiving elements decreases. Analysis oi the
possibility oi measuring the angular coordinate shows that. in contrast to target

which coincides with the results at [5]. In systems with a small number oi
receiving elements. when measuring bearing, in order to eliminate unambiguity it
is necessary to have a substantial exoansion oi sicnal spectrum and the problem
may be solved by using a multiple-trequency signal. in this instance. expression
(22) remains true ii the interval between the extreme scale irequencies is taken
as Al and the central irequency of this interval is taken as in.

oi the receiving antenna array. Furthermore, relationships suitable lor the
remote zone loilow as a special case from relationships which are valid (or the
Fresnel zone. '

Analysis oi these relationships shows that in the Fresnel zone. the potential
accuracy oi range estimation rises (versus remote zone) owing to consideration of
inlormatlon included in the signal wave iront curvature. This rise Is even more
substantial ii the curvature oi the wave lront is greater: it also depends on the
number of array elements. With a constant signal-to-nolse ratio. potential
accuracy is higher ii the number at array elements ls reduced. To some extent.
this is compensation {or a drop in accuracy which may arise due to the drop in
signal-to-nolse ratio when the number ol array elements is reduced.

participates in regular or coupled iorrns oi interaction.

Let us touch upon the physical interpretation oi processes taking place in
greater detail.

At small values oi q there occurs an ordinary mechanism oi grouping oi electron
ﬂux in crossed ilelds (Fig. 2b). Then the grouped electron ilux ialls into a high-
irequency iield oi diiierent polarization. corresponding to the coupled kind oi
interaction (Fig. 2c). The grouping process continues. but the cluster begins to
drop away irom the plane Y0 = 0 and the amplitude oi the high-irequency iields
diminishes. Later the electron ilux again ialls in the iield oi initial polarization.
but now in its acceleratlve phase: degrouping oi the cluster starts and the
cluster continues to iall away (Fig. 2d). The remainlng portion oi the cluster
ialls into the retardation phase oi the high-frequency iield. leading to a rise oi
electrons. grouping. and increase oi the high-irequency iield (Fig. 2e. i). During
the rise phase. electrons are able to get rather close to the delay systems. Thus
when the cluster oi electrons returns to the accelerative phases oi the high-
irequency iield. iirst rticipating in coupled and then in the regular kind oi
interaction (Fig. 2g. is . the processes oi energy exchange occur so intensively
that amplitudes IF‘I and IF‘I virtually disaprear (Fig. 2a. q = 9.6). Subsequently
the grouped beam induces a high-irequency ield in the system which corresponds
to the ordinary lrind oi interaction: and a process similar to that depicted in
Figure 2! begins. At such lengths oi interaction space. electrons are already
starting to settle into periodic structures.

Ii electron ﬂux is in synchronism with one oi the normal CTL waves. ior
example with wave 6. (b. s 0). then the nature oi the interaction process
changes and will be similar to the corresponding processes in an ordinary TWMT.
Let us emphasize once more that the chiei distinctions between the processes
described and similar ones in type 0 interaction (ci. chapter I oi study [#1) are
that the beam in crossed iields participates in both ordinary and coupled kinds
oi interaction. '

of interaction space (b-d) for the case
where input signal is fed to the upper
periodic structure (Po. e 0.3, Fo- = 0:
Yo 3 0).

If special measures are not taken to suppress wave 52 through the interaction
space. there is some intensification of wave El up to and including saturation;
the level of saturation weakly depends on the input signal level (Fig. 3a).
Electrons in this case have both longitudinal and transverse displacements: the
electron cluster remains immobile with respect to wave El. always located in its
retardation phase. and breaks down into two virtually symmetrical portions. one
of which rises upward from Y a 0. while the other falls (Fig. 3b); at some
length. electrons begin to settle into periodic structures. This type of grouping
is linked with the existence of wave 52 (hatched curves in Figure 3a), which is
excited in phase with the cluster and remains almost synchronous with it. but
slightly advanced in phase. virtually until the settling process begins (hatch-
dotted line in Figure 3a). The most significant distinction of this buncher from
an ideal one is that in the nascent inclined clusters. electrons are concentrated
not in plane Y : 0, but in regions of maximum transverse displacements of
electrons (vertical displacements may be reduced by increasing b2. or by using
special "electrodynamic" means to attenuate the field of symmetrical wave 52
and. as was noted, space charge forces should lead to a reduction in transverse
displacements of electrons).

Analysis of the buncher in which the input signal excites symmetrical wave E2
showed that. as was done irom estimates. the potential energy of the beam
changes slightly and the high-frequency field remains almost constant at large
input signal values (Fig. 5a. b).

"These results permit us to conclude that with the aid of a buncher containing
CTL, it is possible to shape rather dense clusters. The use of this buncher as
an input section in instruments havmg crossed fields may significantly improve
the characteristics of the latter. Corresponding calculations show that
eliiciency may be increased by [045%. The possibility of considerable
truncation of the length of the input section (by 2 to 2.5 times) in comparison

CONCLUSION

The results cited above supplement the known picture oi physical processes oi
interaction in crossed iieids and indicate the theoretical possibility oi creating
beam-type type-M devices with improved parameters.

In the iuture it will be important to study the eiiect oi the iorces oi space
charge and cyclotron waves on the nature oi multiple-wave interaCtlons in type
M beam-type devices.

it is almost obvious, in particular. that explosive instability [5] must occur even
in three-irequency interaction in type M beam-type devices when cyclotron
waves are excited in the beam.

Experimental verification oi the posited eiiects is especially important.

[Article by V. N. iludko. F. M. Klement' yev, N. M. Novikova: "Nonparametric
model oi detection oi signals observed by human operator on CRT against a
background oi noises")

[Text] For eiiicient operation oi radio engineering systems in which the iinal
link in the processing oi iniormation is a human operator, it is necessary to
match the working characteristics oi the systems and man. One vital issue oi
such coordination is that oi a iormalized description of human behavior in visual
detection oi signals against a background oi noises on a CRT. Let us consider
in the general iorm those processes which make up the ioundation oi
psychological data in describing the situation oi detection oi signals by a human
operator. Let there exist some set oi signals 5, which in some iorm is depicted
as a set oi mental images. Let us assume that there exists some solving device
which. on the basis oi extant sensory data. works out a set oi response reactions
or behavioral iorms. In addition to the set oi external signals there also exist
suurtes ni additional external iniormation. Naturally, output iniormation linked
with the results oi response reactions in the iorm oi ieedback enters the input
oi the operating sensory system. Signals oi ieedback may be changes in the
environment or iniormation about evaluation of results oi actual behavior oi the
human operator. There exists a source oi internal iniormation which units
various systems associated with the work oi the regulatory, predictive, and an
especial motivational-estimational mechanism. Both sources oi external in-
iormation and sources oi internal iniormation aiiect the work oi the decision
unit. Thus the working characteristics oi the human operator who detects a
signal against a background oi noises on the CRT has a probability nature.
Working characteristics we take to mean the relationship oi probability oi
rleteetion oi a signal and its intensity when the latter is observed on a
background oi noise.

The fundamental probability set of workin characteristics of a human operator
is generated by the following features: I fluctuation of sensory threshold: 2)
probability characteristics of external effects; 3) straying of attention; it) lack

of observation time due to finite speed of information handling; and 5) signal
masking by noise.

We use the operational definition of threshold as some empirical ntity
applicable for the characteristics of functional possibilities of man [i The
actual working characteristics of the
human operator are the result of an
integrative action of the sources of the
proba‘biiity set mentioned above. To
explan the logical foundation of work
a n n of the decision unit, and the logical
behavioral basis of the human operator
in the situation of detecting signals
n n against a noise background on a CRT, it
is necessary to eliminate the effect of
the aforementioned causes on the work
of the human operator. Actual working
characteristics of the operator can be
experimentally obtained allowing for the
requirements stated above.

A trigger pulse from a synchronizer 1 produces simultaneous turn on of the
display scanner g and the pulse shaper 2. An oscillograph type C8-9A with
memory is used as the display. A U-pulse generator is employed as the pulse
shaper. The U-shaped pulse obtained at the shaper output is transformed by
filter 2 into a bell-shaped pulse and enters the adder Q, where there is additive
summation with low-frequency noise (normally distributed) which enters from the
noise generator Z. After passing through a matching filter 2. the signaionoise
mixture is led to the oscillograph screen 9. The screen shows the realization of
the mixture of bell-shaped pulse with normal low-frequency noise. The signal is
elmsen with rather high intensity to eliminate the effect of sensory threshold
fluctuations. To avoid having a priori information (as an additional information
somce) display a probability nature, the signal was always situated at the same
point on the seaming line: this was known to the operator. in the realization
being presented. the signal was not always present, but only in 5/6 of the cases.
Alternation of blank (noise only) and signal (signalonoise) realizations with
different .ignal amplitudes was done in random sequence.

The methods Used in working with operators who partici ted in the experiment
were as lollowst the human operator was given the tas of detecting a signal

presented as a one-time display of signal and noise mixture. The display
observation time was unlimited. l.e.. the human operator had not Information
handling time deficit. The brightness of the scanning line during the experiment
was kept constant: before the start of the experiment the operator became
adapted to this brightness. Experiments were run in a darkened room with
no exterior illumination of the screen. The operator's reactions contained two
responses: “yes”--there is a signal, and "m”«there is no signal. Operator
responses were evaluated by a value matrix: reward lor correct detection and
fine for erroneous decision. Errors were signals missed and false alarms--
detection of a signal when only noise was displayed. Operators first took part
in control experiments and were trained. When the results at the operators
became stable. they switched to the basic experiments.

Each series of experiments lasted an hour or less to eliminate fatigue of the
visual analyzer and straying of operator attention.

The probability of signal detection, and the probability of false alarm, were
evaluated according to the frequency of the event being evaluated:

P = Nlle

where N. is the number of positive decisions; N is the total number of displays;
in experiment N = l00 ior each signal-to-noise ratio.

Four trained operators participated in the experiment; each received a working
characteristic; the averaged working characteristic curve is shown in Figure 2.

liy substituting (2) in (l), we derive an expression for the working characteristic
of the mean statistical operator, where the parameter describing the individual
nature of the operator will only be the probability of false alarm x3.

Let us examine the working characteristics of automatic non-parametric signal
detectors and compare them with the working characteristics of the human
operator obtained in our experiment.

A signal detector is trailed non-parametric if it provides constant probability of
ialse alarm with very weak limitations on the statistical characteristics of input
signals In The working characteristics of automatic nonparametric detectors
used for signal detection are the sign, rank, and sign-rank statistics cited

in l2]. They have identical structure and may be generalized and represented as

where K is some coefficient. distinctive for different working characteristics.
depending on the kind of slgnal and the distributive function of interference.
Generalized formula (3) and the working characteristic of the mean statistical
operator (1) have Identical structures. This also suggests that in detection of
signals with background noise on a CRT, the human operator appears to use non.
parametric criteria since the results of his work can be represented in a form
analogous to (3).

A distinctive feature of non-parametric detectors is the independence of the
probability of false alarm on the kind of noise distribution function.

For the human operator. this peculiarity was tested experimentally. The working
rharavteristirs were recorded for the same four trained operators for two
different noise distribution functions. Within the limits of reliable interpretation
of error. the probability of false alarm was almost unchanged. The supposition
of non-parametric criteria used by the human operator in signal detection with
background noise on a CRT will aid in calculating the efficiency of operation of
the "man-CRT" system.

Klinnyev: "Study oi Aspects oi Ampliiication oi Wide-Band Signals in Type 0
Traveling-Wave Tubes with Random Oscillations"]

ll’extl Ampliﬁcation oi noise-type oscillations (cl. [1,2,31) is employed in the
operation ol some electronic deviCes and radio engineering systems in microwave
technology. in this respect. the greatest interest is involved with wide-band
ampliﬁers. especially type 0 and M traveling-wave tubes.

Ordinary ampliﬁcation oi a noise-type signal in a traveling-wave tube (TV/T) is
associated with its direct action on the input of the delay system. As far as
the authors know. theoretical analysis oi noise-type signal ampliﬁcation in TVITs
has only been done [or M-type devices [it].

in this study, a similar approach has been taken toward Tll‘l's. The investigation
was mainly aimed at explaining the ampliﬁcation efﬁciency of noise-type
signals in TWT with various methods of insertion into interaction space.

The tnethod oi investigation of noise-type signal ampliﬁcation employed is a
realization oi a stationary normal random process and is based on the notion that
it is termed by the harmonics of various frequencies. it is clear that a random
process has no determinate harmonic components. but it makes it possible to
lormaily carry out Fourier analysis and compute the spectral components.
Evaluation ol the spectral density oi noise-type signals is inconsistent, but a
smoothed evaluation will be suited for practical applications. To obtain
rotisislt‘tlt statistical evaluations. it is necessary to smooth out the spectral
sampling density in terms oi a set of segments of realization oi noise-type
signals or in terms oi irequencies [5L

Furthermore. a spectral description of a noise-type signal is convenient for shaping
realizations of pre-set spectral density.

 

Figure 1. Distribution of amplitudes of noise-type signal components through
length of interaction space with: (a) insertion of signal to input of delay system;
(b) insertion of signal via electron flux.

Nonlinear equations of multiple-frequency interaction of electron flux with a
direct electromagnetic traveling wave were utilized in calculations. Calculations
were carried out according to known equations described, for example. in [6].

In determinacy computations it was assumed that the delay system of a traveling-
wave tube has an octave bandpass and delay and coupling resistance are constant
in this band. The effect of attenuation. the action of space charge forces and the
interaction beyond the limits of the band with double overlap in frequency were
not taken into account. The case of a thin beam with synchronism of electron flux
with a traveling electromagnetic wave was investigated. Calculations were carried
out for equidistant spectra, simulated by ten components with a ratio of extreme
spectral frequencies to the fundamental frequency of the working equations equal
to 9 and 18, respectively. The quantities of initial amplitudes of the spectral
components with the interaction of a noise-type signal on the input of the delay
system and the quantities of amplitudes of high-frequency fields which modulate
the electron flux at the input into the interaction space (with signal insertion via
electron flux) were obtained by repeated multiplication by a norming multiplier of
random numbers from the set with normal distributive law having parameters (OJ),
and quantities of initial phases—from a set of random numbers with uniform
distribution in the interval (-11.11). Each realization differed in quantity and phase
nl each spectral component. Furthermore, the dispersion of normal and the
distributive interval of uniform random numbers did not vary from spectrum to
spt't‘trtun. The values of the norming coefficients for normal random numbers were
selected as equal to 0.02. The amplification parameter was taken as equal to 0.05.
The munber ol electrons per period of fundamental freuqenecy was chosen as equal
in 288. For each of the two methods of insertion of the noise-type signal (directly
into the input of the delay system and via electron flux) into the interaction space
of the traveling-wave tube, l0 realizations of the random process were in-
vestigated.

The nature oi gain oi spectral components oi the individual realization is
illustrated in Figure l. in it is shown the distribution lengthwise in the interaction

spare oi the traveling-wave tube oi amplitudes oi components oi the high-
lrequency iield with insertion oi a noise-type signal into the input oi the delay
system (Fig. la) and by means oi pre-modulatlon oi electron ilux. Numeration oi
curves in the iigures corresponds to the order number oi the component oi the
equidistant spectrum used in calculations. The distinctive behavior oi relationships
at initial sections oi the interaction iield and at the point oi maximums oi the
component iieids is clearly seen in the ligures.

The behavioral nature oi the curves, as a rule. corresponds to the patterns oi
signal gain in the multiple-irequency operating mode oi a traveling-wave tube:
spectral components with greatest values oi input signal amplitudes are ampliiied
usually to greater output amplitudes; excitation oi intensive harmonics oi low-
ireqneney i'omponents oi the spectrum is observed (especially with small
mteraetion space lengths); phase relationships play a major role in the amp-
lilii-atinn process: one may see suppression oi individual components, especially
those havmg stnall input signal amlitudes. and so iorth.

in Figure 2 is shown the lengthwise distribution oi traveling-wave tube interaction
spare oi the total high-frequency power ior various realizations. As an example is
given the power distribution oi iive realizations with insertion oi a noise-type
signal directly into the input oi the delay system (Figure 2a) and via electron ilux
(Figure 2b). One can see the unified pattern of behavior oi relationships ior
individual realizations. The iirst peak is associated with the pretered amplification
at one or more (most oiten. high-irequency) components oi the octave spectrum.
The set-and peak is due (with greater length oi delay system) to the more uniiortn
ulnplilit'aliun oi diverse components. The quantity and location oi the power peaks
tlu-mselves diiier ior individual realizations and reilect the change in power irom
realization to realization. Naturally, when the noise-type signal is inserted via
electron llux. the output power has peaks with shorter lengths oi the delay system,
and the diilerent'e in size oi the peaks themselves is barely related to the method
at signal insertion into the traveling-wave tube.

in Figure 3 are shown the mean statistical relationships obtained by averaging
.tu nrding to realizations. Curve 1 oi Figure 3 depicts the lengthwise distribution
nl traveling-wave tube interaction space of medium high-lrequency output with the
llllllli‘llt’t' nl a noise-type signal on the delay system input; curve Zuwith

Iignre curve 3 shows the lengthwise distribution oi interaction space oi a high-
lrt'quem‘y power TWT with ampiiiication oi a monochromatic signal led to the
delay system input at a irequency equal to the average irequency oi the noise-type
spectrum. A mmparison oi relationships proves that with ampliiication oi a wide-
band noise-type signal in a TWT. the magnitude oi output power is much lower
than with atnplilit'ation ol a monochromatic signal. The magnitude oi peak output

ainisna root-nean-equars should come close to being an ideal filter for low
frequencies having a very steep characteristic slope with a cutoff frequency
of appmxisately 0.003 "I.

Closest to the ideal filter are the Battervort, the Chsbyshev, the elliptical
and others. In principle, any of then nay be used for solving the problem
of separating a gravinetric signal froa noise. In practice, filters which
have a siupler stmcture are often used. mltistage filtering with variable
cutoff (6) is especially easy to program and requires a small expenditure of
whine tiﬂh

Let us examine the construction of digital filters from the point of View of
the convenience in igleaenting then in a specialized unit. For a descrip-
tion of digital filters it is convenient to use a s-transfora which is a

discrete analog Laplace transfom (2,7). If the transfer function of the
linear system is represented in the font

If at least one value b is not «pal to zero, then the filter in expression
(2) is recursive , that s for generating the output signal not on]; the value
of the input signal is used but also the previous value of the output. If
all b : 0 then the filter has a nonrecursivs structure and a siwle linear
weigh ing of the itput readmte is used for generating the output signal.

Nonrecureive filters may have excellent phase characteristics but a large
mnber of sections is required for achieving a sharp cutoff. Filters with

a sharp cutoff of the frequency characteristic are easy to design using a
recursive structure.

For illustration let us consider the design of a digital Battervort filter.

The periodicity of the frequency is apparent free (10). For a single-valued

pond to an analog systeau such as an no filter with a tine constant 'c I T/a.

During multistage filtering the require-ants for sufficient attenuation with
a noise frequency of 0.1 Ila will be not practically always and noise with
1-2 ruin periods will be more critical. In order to achieve attenuation of
to dB at the frequency ou- 0.ls' , the following tine constants are needed
for each section depending on the filter frequency:

 

I\V(I.)l ‘ 0.7 I 0.1:: l 0.00 l 0.53

The transfer constants in the frequency of the useful signal f : 0.003 II:
are placed on the bottoeu row. It is apparent that the distort on of the
useful signal with the indicated parameter coabinations does not smeed ac-
ceptable limits.

The calculations shown indicate that the time constant of the filter and its
frequency may be varied in rather broad limits depending on the problem at
hand. As a result of this. the following section tine constants are included
in the described 31's“): 6.1., 12.8, 25.6 and 51.2 sec, with the snallest tine
constant intended for laboratory and test unit research and the largest for
potential extresuely unfavorable conditions. 1n. filtering frequency may be
adjusted up to u e 10.

Turning to the phase characteristics of this filter, a general observation
not be suede. It is known that the characteriet'i‘fs of the filter are improved
considerably by inserting a time delay equal to (s) uhen s : 0. In gravi-
nuotric surveying, a time delay is perfectly acceptable. Calculating the time
delay during filtering with variable cutoff, for instance, means that the
remit of averaging is related to the mean of the cutoff. When filtering

with an no filter section it is necessary to include a time delq equal to

the tisue constant.

If the phase characteristics turn out to be ideal when filtering with a
variable cutoff or other filters with a symtrical weighting function,
phase distortions are inevitable for a filter with a transfer function (3).
Nonetheless, with a large a the transfer function approximates the function
of a section with the proper tins delay and the phase characteristics are
iwroved. This is illustrated in figure 2 in which phase characteristics
are shown which allow for a shift in In: for the following filters providing
» identical attenuation in ”agency on 0.lc" .

Since the phase distortions may be ccuputed to be negligibly enall only for
a signal with a period greater than 1000 see for two-stage filtering, a
tenth order filter does not produce appreciable phase distortions up to a
signal with a period of 100 sec.

Thus, the examined filter consisting of series connected muesrical analogs

of an aperiodic section achieves a small attenuation and insignificant phase
distortions in the area of the useful signal and practically couplets quenching
of the noise. Hith the inclusion of a tins delay, the filter has an order of
astatisa equal to two, that is upon coepletion of the transfer processes,

the linearly varying useful signal is reproduced precisely (7). The described

For large time constants and rates of acceleration it is inpossible to ana-

plotted characteristics coincide with the theoretical, mich attests to the
accurate operation of the filter's digital circuits.

Although the characteristics of digital filters are calculated with a high
level of precision, nonetheless it is interesting to study the system of
gravilseters: filters for signals which eimlate a gravitational field up to
periods of lOOO-ZCDO see with an enlitude to several tailligals.

Transient processes in the enained 81's“! (fig. 5) say be characterized by
the following values: the duration of the transient process, that is the
time from the lament of input of the signal l(t) to the nonent when the sig-
nal reaches the value 0.99 at the output, the tile delay from the meant of
reaching the 0.5 level and the tile for the gain to equal l/y(t)m.

The dependence of these characteristics on the filter frequency (fig. 6) for
the ties of the transient process and the delay ties with u>t is practically
linear, mile the delay time is equal to at . The delay tins with large
frequencies depends on a slightly. 1he weighting functions plotted experimen-
tally (fig. 5) coincide with the theoretical as defined by the fomtla

The nain feature oi the given chronatographuuse of a special ionization
detector in which the adnixture to be analyzed is ionized by eetastable stone
of neon. In the beginning of the neaauring cycle the chroeatograph conducted
a "dI-y” analysis. verified its efficiency with the help of an electrical
test-signal, and carried out calibration with the help of a control gas
nixture. A special device for taking in the saeplss excluded the entrance
into the instmant of foreign abirturas associated with the functioning of
the releasable apparatus.

with the help of the gas chrasatograph "Sign" nine analyses were node of
samples of the venutian atnosphere. kprsss processing of the findings shouted

mnher of geasso-nitrogen Mt). argon (~ .6 r 1040/0). and carbon nonouds

Soviet releasable apparatus was carried out for the first tins. on ”Pionor-
Venus" this teal: was not set up.

The findings (about 500 spectra and angular scans) dancmtrated a gradual
change in the distribution of energy in the spectrum for scattered solar radi-
ation as the spacecrafts entered deeper into the atnosphers. This change was
governed by aerosol scattering (on particles of clouds). gas Rayleigh scat-
term and absorption in absorption hands belonging to 002 and "20. In the

[Text] The results of investigating the noise
of a receiving system, consisting of a photo-
detector and sectional single-mode optical
amplifier with high amplification factor (on
the order of 107) are reported. It is shown
that the noise introduced by the optical
amplifier is technical in nature and the
modulation noise is considerably less than the
additive noise with input laser signal power
less than 10'12 H. The pnotodetecting system in
the frequency range from 10 to 100 kn: had a

threshold sensitivity on the order of l0'15
w/uzl/z.

One of the most important characteristics of a weak signal
optical amplifier (00) is the noise introduced by it. The
additive noise of OU spontaneous emission impinging on the
photodetector and so-called multiplicative or modulation
noise are distinguished. Estimates from the results of
previous investigations show that natural additive noise of

a xenon-helium amplifier of special design (optimum by noise)
ll. 2] has a value on the order of 10-17 H/ﬂzl/Z, which is
considerably less than threshold sensitivity of standard
infrared photodetectors. However, available data on the noise
characteristics of ianon-helium 00 [3, 4) are usually

qualitative in nature and do not permit one to make specific
conclusions either about the capabilities of these 00 or about
the nature of their natural noise. The results of investigating
the noise of a xenon-heliuu on, which has a high aaplification
factor (K approximately 5 - 105) are outlined in this paper.

The investigations were conducted on an installation whose
diagran is presented in Figure l. The emission of xenon-helium
laser (optical generator 06) operating at a wavelength of 3.51
nicrons. passed through a glass attenuator O. latching lenses

L1 and 52 and entered the optical aeplifier 00. The anplified
emission was detected by a photodetector FP. as which a photo-
resistor. cooled to nitrogen temperature. based on indium
antimonide with threshold sensitivity of 6'10‘11 w/ﬂt1/3 at a
frequency of 100 kuz, was used. One of the mirrors of the
probing 06 was placed in piezoceranics PK. which Iade it possible
to readjust its frequency: the output emission was modulated by

a mechanical breaker P. The OU operated in a single diffraction
node Ill and consisted of two stages K1 and K2, latching between
which was acconplished by a lens L4 and diaphrages 01 and 02.
Lenses L, and L5 for-ed the input and output beans, respectively.
The photoresponse voltage was amplified by a preanplifier Pu and
was fed to the spectral analyzer AS input.

The spectra of the photodetector noise. caused by spontaneous
nsission of the 00 and by the amplified laser signal. are
(hown in Figure 2, a. The spontaneous enissivs power of the
OU inpinging on the photodetector had a value of approximately
5 pw. while the intensity fluctuations of the probing 06 (with
power of the last order of several sicrowatts) were negligible
over the entire range of investigated frequencies. It is
obvious that all the graphs have sharp rises in the region of
30-40 kuz and approximately 70 kHz, apparently caused by the
presence of regular plasma oscillations (strata) in the
discharge.

The spectrus of the discharge current fluctuations of the first
stage K1 is shown in Figure 2, b for cosparison. It is easy to
note the specific correlation between the spectra and Figure 2,
a and b (for current of zlnA). We note that the spectra of
spontaneous emission fluctuations and the spectra of current
fluctuations of the second stage have no sharply marked rises
at typical frequencies.

The shape of the spectrum and the absolute value of the spectral
density of noise are strongly dependent on the first stage
discharge current of the 00 (figures 2, b and J). The
dependence of the signal/noise ratio on the values of the
discharge currents of the stages are shown in figure 3.
Reception was accomplished at a frequency of 1 has (the
mechanical cut-off frequency of the 06 signal) and the radio-
amplifier band comprised approximately 60 us. figure 3 shows
that the maximum amplification is shifted to the range of

high currents with respect to the maximum signal/noise. i.e..

esplification is maximum in the region of a sharp increase of
plasea fluctuations.

An increase of input laser signal power leads to an increase

of amplifier noise due to modulation addition.(?igures l and 4).
Measurements at a frequency of 1 has showed that the modulation
noise increases, as one would expect. in proportion to the

input laser signal power (with variation from 10'14 to 10"11 H)
and it is comparable in value to additive noise at power of
approximately 10‘12 K (Figure 4). The further increase of

input signal power (fron 10'11 to 10'9 u) did not lead to an
increase of modulation noise due to amplifier saturation [5].
Moreover. the total amplifier noise level even decreased due

to a decrease of additive noise. since the latter is the product
of the spontaneous eniesive power of the effective source
located at the beginning of the 00 by its amplification factor
for spontaneous emission [S] (the latter was saturated by the
laser signal). However, a drop of 2! amplification occurs

sore rapidly than a decrease of ncise since the saturated 00

has worse noise characteristics compared to a linear
(unsaturated) on.

The results of the investigations per-it one to make the
following conclusions.

[Text] The results of investigeting the noise
of a Dc discharge plasma in an opitcal amplifier
operating in a us-xr mixture are reported. It
is shown that the Dc discharge in a na-xa
mixture is characterized by the presence of a
zone of reactiveoscilletions(at low currents),
strata (at high currents) and anoscillation-
free section (in the intermediate region of
currents). The current boundaries of the
oscillation-free section are constricted with

an increase of filament voltage. When the
strata are excited, they are amplified in the
direction toward the cathode and the local
percentage modulation of the lateral spontaneous
emission in the visible region of the spectrum
may reach 100 percent. The strata had the
following characteristics: wavelength of
approximately lcn, frequency of approximately
30k": and phase velocity of approximately lo‘cm/sec.

The optimum quantum noise level for two-stage design noise for
xenon-helium opitcal amplifier (00) (A- 3.51 microns) is
several orders below the noise level of the best infrared
photodetectors [1). However, it has been noted in the
literature [2) that the additive noise of 00 may have a value
appreciably exceeding the sensitivity threshold of a standard

photodatector. This noise is apparently technical in nature
and may specifically be caused by fluctuations of plasma
parameters. We note that there is practically no data in
the literature on investigation on the noise properties of a
discharge in a xenon-heliun nixtura. The results of
investigating the conditions for the occurrence and the
existence ofoscillationsin a discharge plasaa in the
cuvattes of a xenon-helium 00 are outlined in this paper.

The 00 cuvette was placed on a lovable plattors which could
be moved along the horizontal axis with respect to a vertical
slit diaphragm. The lateral spontaneous emission of the

narrow section of the discharge (on the order of lnn) passed
through the glass wall of the cuvette. was modulated by a
nachanical breaker and was detected by a photodatector, as
which a silicon photodiode with saxinum sensitivity in the
visible region of the spectrue was used. The photoresponse
voltage was anplified by a radio preamplifier and was fed to

a spectral analyser and synschronous detector. The current
fluctuation signal (which was a reference signal for syn-
schronous detection when measuring the wavelength of the strata)
was taken iron the resistor in the cathode discharge circuit.
The currents in both arms of the cuvette were balanced during
aeasureeent. The cuvette paraneters used in the exparieents
are presented in the table. All the cuvettas had two-anode
design with central hot cathode and were equipped with a bypass
channel which made it possible to eliminate separation of the
mixture due to cataphoresis.

current. the spectrum is enriched with new components and the
frequency of the mainoscillation decreases. The typical pattern
of intensity modulation distribution of lateral spontaneous
emission along the length of the cuvette (see Figure 3. a)
permits one to assume that these regularoscillations are strata
[4-6]. The similarity of the current fluctuation and emission
intensity fluctuation spectra is explained by the fact that

the traveling strata modulate the discharge current. Sharp

the presence of hysteresis and sections with positive slope for

The results of measuring the percentage modulation M of the
lateral emission of cuvettes l and 2 by strata at different
discharge currents are presented in Figure 3, a and b. It is
obvious that amplification of the strata occurs toward the
cathode (unlike a neon-helium mixture where the strata are
amplified toward the anode [5]). We note that amplification
of the strata toward the cathode is also observed in pure
helium and xenon [8; 9]. The distribution of percentage
modulation is symmetrical with respect to the cathode for
cuvette 2. The asymmetry of distribution for cuvette l was
apparently caused by the fact that. unlike cuvette 2, it had
different anodes: an anode in the form of a molybdenum rod
(the left anode in Figure 3. a) and an annular molded anode.
The dips near the cathode on the curves of percentage modula-
tion distribution may be caused by inhomogeneity of the
cuvette channel near the cathode outlet and possibly by the
mutual effect of strata in different arms. Typical fluctuations
of the percentage modulation of emission along the cuvette
axis are observed at currents slightly exceeding the threshold
value of the occurrence of strata and modulation disappears
near the cathode. These fluctuations are determined by
interference between the members, one of which describes the
distribution of strata along the cuvette axis and the other of
which describes modulation of discharge current [10, ll]. We
note that the distance between adjacent maximums is equal to
the wavelength of the strata. The amplification index of the
strata was determined by the slope of the linear section of
the curves and had a value on the order of 0.1 cm'l.

The cathode filament voltage has a significant effect on the
width of the current region in which there are no regular
plasmaoscillationg, The boundaries of this region are shown
in Figure 4 as a function of filament voltage. The maximum
width of the region is achieved at the lowest voltage 01,
determined by the normal operating conditions of an oxide
cathode. The current boundaries of the regions of existence
of strata and reactiveoscllltfionlintersect at specific
voltage 02 and a region appears in which theseoscillations may
exist simultaneously. A characteristic feature is that the
stratain this region are excited by the second harmonic of
relaxationoscillations. we note that constriction of the
region where there are no regularoscillations may be caused by
the indicated synchronization since a reverse effect is observed

in some cases: an increase of filament current leads to expansion
of this region [7, 12].

The results of the investigations permit one to make the
following conclusions.

1. A Dc discharge in a xenon-helium mixture is characterised
by the presence of three typical regions as a function of its

value: regions of the existence of strata (at high currents).
reactiveoscillations(at low currents) and an oscillation-free

region. while the boundaries of the latter are constricted with
an increase of filament voltage.

2. The strata are amplified from the anode to the cathode and
amplification is subject to exponential law with index of
approximately 0.1 cn'1 in the initial section.

3. An increase of the total pressure of the gaseous mixture
leads to a decrease of the typical frequency of the strata:
from approximately 30 R": at pressure of 2.4 torr to
approximately 20 RR: at 4.8 torr.

4. The local (along the length of discharge) percentage

modulation of lateral spontaneous emission by strata may reach
100 percent.

5. The shape of the anode affects the conditions for the
occurrence and existence of strata at small values of discharge

current (and, accordingly, at low amplification factors of the
strata).

6. Phase velocity is opposite to group velocity a direction
and has a value on the order of lo4 cn/scc.

amplitude and stability of microsecond pulses
of ruby laser emission with negative feedback
are presented. It is shown that the
possibilities of controlling the microsecond
emission pulse parameters increase signifi-
cantly when using a modulating pulse
consisting of a jog corresponding to

rapid Q-switching, a pulse peek

slowly increasing by exponential law and a
steep trailing edge. The instability of the
moment of initial generation decreased to e value
of approximately 25 nsec when using step
connection of the cavity Q-factor.

One of the most effective methods of increasing the emission
pulse length of solid-state lasers with Q-switching to
microseconds or more is the use of negative feedback (008)
and slow connection of cavity Q-factor [1-3]. It follows
from analysis of balance equations of this laser that the
shape of the emission pulse is considerably dependent on the
law of cavity Q-switching (ll. It is very difficult to

derive theoretically the required law of Q-switching for
different pulse shapes. In the simplest case. the cavity
Q-factor should vary by exponential law to shape square-
wave emission pulses, which provides equality of ampli-
fication and losses in the cavity [4]. The law of switching
close to exponential was used in experimental investigations
of lasers with 003 described in [1-3].

The results of investigating the effect of various laws of
cavity Q-switching on the shape of the microsecond pulse of

a RL-8x120/180 ruby laser with electrooptical feedback are
presented in the given paper. The diagram of the experi-
mental installation is similar to that described in [3]. The
laser cavity 0.6m long had a configuration close to semicon-
centric. A smoother emission pulse peak is achieved with this
configuration [2]. The cavity Q-factor was controlled by a
DKDP crystal light shutter, to whose electrodes modulating
pulses and negative feedback voltage were fed. The modulating

voltage pulses were shaped by a special generator which permits
regulation of their parameters.

Generation of a laser with feedback having slow law of cavity
Q-switching was initially investigated. The shape of the
modulating voltage on the shutter electrodes (Figure l, a) was
approximated to the form

where U A 2 is the half-wave voltage of the shutter, K0 is the

are the losses in the cavity with completely open shutter and
U0 is the shutter cut-off voltage. Emission pulses 1-3 ’ASOC
long with flat peak and smoothly decreasing trailing edge were
shaped in this case. The generated pulses had high instability

pulses, since the value and steepness of the modulating voltage

25 nsec with this law. At the same time, the stability of
the emission pulse shape increased significantly. Variation

An important positive feature of introducing a jog in the
modulating pulse was to expand the possibility of controlling
the shape of the emission pulse. The amplitude of the jog U.
affects the emission pulse delay t, with respect to the leading
edge of the modulating pulse and the amplitude of the leading
edge of the emission pulse I . Oscillograms of esission pulses
at different amplitudes of jog Us are presented in Figure l,

d and f. The experimental dependence of 1p and t2 on U. are
presented in Figure 2. It follows from them that delay of the
moment of the beginning of pulse generation t2 decreases with
an increase of Us. reaching some practically constant value
determined by the time of development of generation. In this
case the amplitude of the leading edge.of the emission pulse

Ip does not change initially. but then increases rapidly. This
dependence of I? on U. permits one to tranform square-wave

By cutting off the cavity Q-factor at the necessary moment of
time, one can cut the descending trailing edge of the emission
pulse (Figure l, e, f, i and j) and one can shape pulses close
to square-wave and one can also change their length.

Regulation of the emission pulse length is also possible by
varying the pumping energy an. The delay of the beginning of
generation tz decreases and the eeission pulse length increases
with an increase of En. In this case the pulse amplitude varies
slightly (Figure 3). The pulse shape changes to triangular
(Figure 3, b) with pumping close to generation threshold. The
segment of the modulating voltage pulse corresponding to slow
cavity Q-switching determines the shape of the emission pulse
peak. Square-wave emission pulses are formed during selection
of the law of variation of the modulating voltage on this
section which provides equality of amplification and losses
(Figure l, f). The slope of the emission pulse peak can be
regulated and it can be made convex by changing the steepness

S of this segment of the modulating pulse (Figure l, h). The
amplitude of pulse convexity Iv increases with an increase of
steepness s (Figure 4). By changing the amplitude of the
modulating pulse jog Us and the steepness of the voltage increase
at the modulating pulse peak 8. one can rind square-wave emission
pulses with different amplitudes, which is not achieved when
using modulating pulses without a jog. Regulation of the
emission pulse amplitude is also possible by varying the depth

of feedback (Figure l, f and 1). However, this method has
limited use since a ﬂacrease of negative feedback increases the
cut of the emission pulse peak and makes its overall stability
worse.

By using slow switching law (Figure l. a) with high value of
pumping energy 3n and deep feedback (to. - 6.25-10'3 Viv),
pulses with steep leading edge may be transformed to pulses
with smoothly increasing amplitude (Figure 3. t). This
transformation of pulse shape is related to the fact that

the generation threshold is carried out with high losses on
the light shutter which provide a :low increase of the number
of photons in the cavity.

Thus, the investigations showed that the use of special stepped
nodulating voltage pulses pernits one to increase the stability
of microsecond emission pulses and to expand the possibility of
controlling their length, amplitude and shape.

A METHOD OF RESTORING LASER BEAM EAERGY DISTRIBUTION FROM DATA

[text] Existing methods of investigating the distribution of
laser energy in the beam cross-section are usually related to
the necessity of branching part of the energy to a measuring
device [1). which is difficult to accomplish at high energy
densities and large beam cross-sections. The use of an array
of bolometric vire sensors in combination with a specific
processing a;gorithm makes it possible to measure the energy
distribution over a wide spectral range [2]. having avoided
the necessity of energy branching. A method of determining
the energy center and effective beam diameter by using
bolometers is described [31, but this method does not permit
one to measure the energy distribution. At the same time an
important advantage of reticular bolometric sensors,
consisting in the fact that they do not introduce significant
distortions in the transient laser beam, provides the basis
to attempt to use them as an onergy distribution meter.

To simplify further consideration, let us make a nu-ber of
aasunptions. Let us assule the following:

(1) the spacing of the holonetric arrays h is such greater
than the laser emission wavelength A and the boloneter diameter
d. i.e.. we scenes that the eutual effect of the bolo-eters
during diffraction of the esission on the grid say be
disregarded:

(2) the grid dinenaions are each greater than the typical
cross-sectional dinensiona of the laser energy concentration

zone and integration can he carried out within infinite
intervals:

(3) laser enission has circular polarization:

(4) the laser pulse length {i is much less than the constant
bolonater cooling tile;

(5) the effect of emission does not lead to thermal expansion
of the boloneters. while the dependence of holoueter resistance
on asission intensity is linear.

Let laser emission be propagated along axis Oz in a coordinate
system (x, y, r‘). bound to a laser source (Pigure l). The
value of power w (x. y. r, t) in plane r-z', located in the
Prauenhoter zone, will be a cross-section of the space-time
power distribution of the laser source at r-r'. Let us

further assume that the axes of parallel wire boloneters with
diameter d and spacing h are located in this same plane. Let
us also assume that there are several arrays of parallel
boloseters and that they are arranged rather close to each
other along axis 02. Let us describe the orientation of the
boloseters of the j-th array n by using the coordinate

system {'1' yj, 25}, whose axis 0y, coincides with that of the
centralwiuu Let us assume that axis 0y, is rotated by angle

Gj with respect to axis 0 . Keeping in sind the short length
of the laser pulse compare to the thermal constant tins of the
boloseter, one may assume that variation of boloneter resistance
AR will be detersined by the integral of power by the pulse
time or by the energy distribution or the laser pulse

If the measured Voltage or current increment on the i-th

sequence {90:1 )} determines the discrete projection of the
desired 6 strigution function r (x. y) onto axis 0y). with
this approach. the problem of measuring the energy distribution
reduces to that of restoring the function of two variables

P (x, y) by discrete projections measured at angles 9 .

Radon [5], who used a method similar to iterative met ods, was
apparently the first to work successfully on the problem of
restoring the functions of several variables by their projections.
In the considered case an approach based on the mathematical
apparatus of Fourier transformations (P?) of functions of many
variables is more promising.

Two important properties related to projection of function

f (x) with the Fourier-image of this function are subsequently
required. The first property consists in the fact that if

f (x) and P («1) form the pair PP. then f (xh) and P (aJA)
will also be the pair PF provided that matrix A. which describes
the transformation of coordinates, is orthogonal. The second
property, also called the theorem on projections and cross-
sections [6]. permits one to state that (N-1)-dimensional PF
of projection is the cross-section of the N-dimensional P? of
function f (3). Taking both properties into account, one may
conclude that the projection for which the projection axis is
the transformed coordinate axis uj. has (N-l)-dimensional PP,
which is the cross-section P (11) at £11 - 0. and coordinate
systems u and!) are related to systems x ended by the same
orthogonal transformation

In the con'idered case, rotation of each bolometer grid around
axis Oz by angle 01 is described by orthogonal transformation

In this regard the data obtained from each bolometer array

and which determined the discrete projection of distribution

P (x. y) at angle 9 simultaneously determine the cross-
section of the Fourier-image of spectral distribution at the
same angle and space. The relationship between the projections
of the function of two variables and the cross-section of its
P? is presented in Figure 3.

By using the properties of PP pairs outlined above, one can
construct the algorithm for restoration of energy distribution

P (x, y) by the measured sequences (2). The main steps will
be the following.

1. Measuring the oriented arrays of sequences (2) in the
appropriate eanner by using H.

2. Determining the images oriented in space according to
orientation of the signal arrays in space by using the

discrete Fourier transform (DP?) H or the Fourier-image
cross-sections of the desired distribution (P) x, y.

3. Applying the images of the effective interpolation
operation obtained by readings in space to find the array of
readings required for reverse OPP.

a. Calculating the readings of the desired two-dimensional
function P (x, y) in the signal space by applying the two-
disensional reverse DP? to the readings in the spectral space.

It should be noted in conclusion that aachine realization of
the described process of restoration can be based on use of

the ”test P?“ algorithm [7], which significantly reduces the
losses of machine time. Moreover, the discrete nature of
measuring the projections by using boloaeters permits efficient
organization of data input into the computer.
