LATIN MERIUN ILLEGAL DINO TRAFFIC, WWI“! menses
Buenos Aires LA OPIﬁiON in Spanish 3 Feb 79 p 3
[Xrtieic by Eiguel Carreir§7

[Text7 The International narcotics Control Organization
recently requested its member governments to investigate the
real organizers of the world drug traffic by maintaining a
stricter watch on money movements. In its annual report,

the organization, which belonrs to the United Nations, states
that clandestine narcotics production and smuggling generate
huge amounts of spending and profits. This means that govern-
ments can work against drug dealers if they will cooperate more
intensively in watching the international movements or large
amounts of money. The organization states in its report: "It
would be desirable for governments to consider perhaps even

by means of international Agreements, the osaibility or in-
vestigating extremely carefully the capita used to finance
international drug traffic. This would make it possible to
identify the financial backers who are the real organizers
behind this traffic." Particularly in Latin America, drug
smugrlinr and production have continued to grow in recent times.
The following article is a study of drug production and sales
in Latin America. The article is based on information gathered
by the ?rench Press Agency.

raris. r‘nlot:.bia, the source of the most sought after and
apparently most select marihuana in the world, is today --
along with the "coke" from Peru and Bolivia -- the main

Latin American source of supply for some MO million North
American drug addicts.

21
During 1978, from Argentina to Mexico, the total figures, which
are of course somewhat imprecise, re art the confiscation or
seizure of 3,593 tons of marihuana, 9,297 kilos of cocaine,

2 991 doses of LSD 200 kilos of heroin 96 kilos of a variet
of amphetamines and barbiturates, and k5 kilos of opium.

According to data from the various national police forces,
strictly regional dru addiction last year sent to Jail 6 000
persons in Mexico (1 of whom were 0.8. citizens), 2000 in
Chile (10 percent of whom were minors) 1,k3 in Ar entina,
1068 in Ecuador (MOB dealers and 660 addicts , 300 n Bolivia
(in the past k years) 33 rings of drug dealers in Venezuela,
165 persons involved in drug running (or "mulas”) in Colombia;
also inicogombia, nine planes and 2 ships carrying marihuana
were se ze..

The Source of "Snow"

The avalanche of "snow" which, starting from the South American
tropics, pcurs into the industrious north, starts with the
clandestine coca plantations in Peru and Bolivia, but its

main shipping port is in Colombia, facing on both the Atlantic
and Pacific ceans.

with its land area of 1 1k1,01k square kilometers, Colombia

harvests at least 100,000 hectares of top quality marihuana --

including the famous "Santa Marta." Colombia also cultivates

cocaine, although in small quantities. It does however, pro-

gzss the coca extract that comes from Peru, Bolivia, and
under.

In Peru, where the authorized coca plantings 10 years ago came
to about 10,000 tons, it is estimated today that, despite the
efforts made by the authorities to wipe out its planting and
cultivation, both legal and illegal production now come to
over 30,000 tons.

Peru produces the basic cocaine extract, an impure drug with
a density of one and a half times hydrochloride. This is
sent to Colombia and Mexico to be processed and purified. A
kilo of cocaine in the 0.8. black market sells for between
$h0,000 and $50,000.

Bolivia is potentially the largest South American reducer

of cocaine. Official sources in La Paz say that 3 percent of
the cocaine consumed in the United States is of Bolivian origin.

22
The u.s. drun enforcement agencies recently reported that
during 1973 the cocaine hydrochloride smuggled into the coun-
try amounted to es tons, of which 17 tons came from Bolivia.

According to those sources in 1978 drug dealers earned
$1,?00,0 0 from cecaine sales, but TIME magazine reported the
0.8. Marie drug profits as $1 billion.

The natural coca leaf, a plant native to the region, has been
known for centuries, and it is traditionally consumed in the
Bolivian highlands because of its stimulating properties when

food is scarce. One gram of cocaine hydrochloride can be
produced from 1 kilo of coca leaves.

hcxico is essentially the "port of entry" into the 0.8. dru
market, and is also a producer and consumer of marihuana a

or some varieties of opium poppies. Aceordina to an official
report Just in the state of Sinaloa alone there are over 2,000
concealed landing strips.

In addition to Sinaloa in the northeast, there are the
"hallucinogenic" areas of ﬂayarit and Guerrero in the vest,
both located on the Pacific. Production is done by peasants

in mountainous areas that are hard for the drug services to
reach.

The other Latin American countries -- primarily Ecuador,
Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina -- are

largely points of connection or consumption, although some, such
as Ecuador, do have some plantings.

Drugs do not seem to be any great social problem in Cuba,
according to observers, but a Cuban official recently remarked
that the problem of drug smuggling occupied the fourth or
fifth place in customs work.

Traditionally, Irdian hemp leaves or an extract of its flowers
were the drugs most in demand with Cuban drug addicts, and

only some of the upper classes used cocaine, heroine, or
morphine.

In recent years there have been few cases involving any
sizeable amount of drug traffic reported in ﬁavana, and all

involved drugs being smuggled by yacht: or small planes from
other Caribbean islands and going to the United States.

23
The "Laundry”

Costa Rica is both a producer and consumer or marihuana, but

it is also -- a feature it shares with other Central American
countries -- a ecuntry which drug authorities believe is used
by drug dealers as a 'laundry."

This "laundering" of nonOﬁ involves fantastic sums that can
not be reinvested in the nited States because of the problems
entailed in Justitying its source to the treasury.

As for hard drugs, Costa Rica annually consumes about 25
kilos of Peruvian or Colombian cocainesobut 80 percent or the

population between the ages of 15 and , especially secondary
evel students, smokes narihuana.

A narihuana "pure," which is a cigarette a little larger than
the standard size costs 5 colones in San Jose (8.6 colones a
$1) and a pound of marihuana, which sells locally for 1,300
colones, in the United States costs $300 to shoe.

Police sources estimate the drugs coming into Costa Rica from
Peru or Colombia at about 125 kilos of cocaine a year, almost
all of which is reexported to North America.

Last October a large drug ring was captured in San Jose with
6 kilos of cocaine in their possession. According to the

police, this gang had smuggled $3.8 million worth of cocaine
into the United states.

Penalties for drug dealers and users vary in Latin America.

In almost all countries, the addict is considered ill, and the
dealer or producer is treated as a criminal.

For the dealer or producer, prison terms range between 3 and
15 yetrs or prison in Argentina, over 5 years (with no early
release) in Mexico, from 3 to 5 in Cuba, from 10 to 15 in
Central America, from k to 8 in Venezuela, from 2 to 8 in

Uru uay, from 3 to 20 in Brazil, from 8 to 12 and fines from
Sh to $2,000 in Ecuador, 25 in Peru, and from 2 to 8 years
in Colombia.

In Peru where the illegal coca crop has quintupled in recent
years, now amounting to 70 percent of the world crop, the
penalties against drug violations have still not been applied,
and it has been learned that some Judges have been penalized
for their readiness to release some suspects from prison.

26
Generally Latin Amorican drug programs are conducted by
special police services, although Mexico, Colombia, and to a
lesser extent, Chile, have used or now use the army in a war
without quarter against drugs.

Agreements against Drug Dealers

In 1978 Colombia signed an agreement with the United States
to "exterminate" drug traffickers and Just 2 months ago
signed a similar agreement with Venezuela.

The government of President Julio Cesar Turbay declared "war"
on drug dealing and the local consum tion of cocaine and
marihuana, and a few days a o the Co ombian minister of de-
fense revealed the forthcom ng purchase of planes to be used
to strengthen the drug traffic control program.

The Colombian drug campaign, being carried out by the army,

police, air force, and navy ships is being waged primarily

along the Atlantic Coast, especially in the northern depart-
ment of la GuaJira, the biggest producer of merihuana.

The biggest haul of marihuana in Colombia occured in la
Guajira, in a place known for drugs. 35 dealers were caught
and 680 tons of drugs were confiscated by the police.

It was also in 1a GuaJira that the "bonanza" marlhuana
plantation eoVering 72,000 hectares was discovered.

In Ecuador drugs come in from Colombia through the Amazon
jungles, the mountains, and the coast, in automobiles, small
planes, suitcases with false bottoms and motorboats. 95
percent is shipped on to the United étates, and 5 percent is
consumed by local addicts.

The Drug Running Cow;trics

The Interpol office in Ecuador recently caught a number of
powerful international drug rings. According to the source,
the smugglers travel directly to Bolivia, acquire the extract
or cocaine in La Paz Cochabamba, Oruro, or Santa Cruz de la
Sierra, and then go to Guayaquil, the main Ecuadorean port,
from where they go to Colombia.

25
Or to Brazil, as is shown by the capture in Rio de Janeiro in
early January 1979 of a ans 1 plane coming from Bolivia with
over 17 kilos of cocaine destined for the United States.

Traveling in the plane were five presumed drug traffickers,
but only one of them, a native of Hong Kong, claimed the
a

responsibility for the shipment and was sen need to 5 years
in prison.

In Brazil the most widely consumed drug is still marihuana
produced in Brazil coming from Hate Grease and Ooias, states
n the central east, Maranhao in the northeast, and Para and

Anazonas in the north.

The alkaloids consumed in Brazil all come from Bolivia and
Peru. Normally the drugs arrive in a highly refined state,
arekdtstilled, and then sent to North American and European
mar e s.

In Venezuela, despite the existence of some plantations near
the Colombian border, the main feature of its drug market
seems to consist, according to reliable opinions, of its
status as a “reexporting” or "drug running" country.

It does seem that the Venezuelan shipping services arouse

l ttle sus icion, and acco ding to estimates of the PTJ
udicial echnical Polic , only 10 percent of the drugs

entering the country are confiscated. The rest is sent on to

the United States and Europe.

Chile, considered 8 years ago to be one of the main world

drug distribution centers, has apparently won its battl
against drug abuse. In any event, official reports reveal
that cocaine consumption and traffic now amount to 10 percent
of the drug activity going on at the beginning of this decade.

Argentina is essentially a transit point for drugs and drug
dealers. Because of the length of its borders, rug dealers
consider it as a link between the consumer countries and supply
sources.

In 1978 the Argentine Federal Police arrested 1,h33 people,
confiscation over half a ton of marihunna, 225 kilos°f plants
and seeds, 33,500 kilos of cocaine hydrochloride, 935 units
of various arphetamines and barbiturates, 1,2kk doses of LSD
from Amsterdam, and 18 grams of opium during the same period.

POPPY PLANTATIONS WED. MICK!” ARRESTED
ﬂexicali LA voz DE LA mm in Spanish 9 Feb 79 Sec 3 p 12

[Text] Mexico City. 8 tebruary—The Pederal Judicial Police dealt the drug
traffic a heavy blow when they located and destroyed as poppy plantations
in the settlenent of Vainilla. in the nunicipality o! Bareguagueto. Sins-
loa. which covered on area of 38,305 square netere in the niddle of the
western Sierra Hadre.

Mann Duarte Castillo. aged 35. one of those responsible for guarding and
cultivating the drugs. was arrested at the sane location as he was attent-
ing to escape. carrying in several trucks 1 ton and 750 kilograsa of raw
narihuana. which was perfectly packed in burlap bags.

The public ninistry oi Culiacan, Sinaloa. with the aid of federal agents
and stay forces. proceeded to burn a total of 500.890 plants which were
groaing there. The individual under arrest refused to disclose the iden-

Nuevo Laredo BL DIARIO DE NDEVO LAREDO in Spanish 24 Jan 79 Sec 8 p 3

[Text] Yesterday. the doors of the jail opened for an individual who- the
Federal Police consider one of the csars of the drug traffic in northern
Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas.

Thanks to an incident involving the disappearance of inforaation fostered by
his defenders. Juan Manuel Seen: Ochoa received a favorable decision handed
down by the second district judge. Luis Garcia Roeero.who ordered the ism»-
diate release of the individual in custody.

Proceedings 50-978 had been initiated against Seen: Ochoa for a cries against
health in various degrees. his defenders sanaged to subsit expert testiaony
as a final recourse to secure his release. and succeeded in their efforts.
when the second district judge issued the pertinent writ for his release.

A chemist hired by the defense for Saens Ochoa. alias "81 Johnny." decided
that a powder seized from the individual who has now been exonerated was not
any kind of drug. The chemists iron the local health center concurred in
this opinion and. on 10 January. they handed down their decision on behalf
of the defendant.

based on this expert testimony. Garcia Ronero decided that the corpus delecti
had not been proven and. in view of this fact. issued an order for the re-
lease of "El Johnny.“ who left the jail yesterday when he had exactly 2

more months of his year's imprisonment left to serve.

The records show that. on 23 March 1978. when the Federal Judicial Police
raided a farm in the municipality of Couales. they found a laboratory for
processing heroin which was being run by Juan Manuel Saenz Ochoa.

in the laboratory there were all kinds of iaple-ents for processing drugs.
including precision scales; and in tone receptacles they found traces of
powders that were regarded as heroin and cocaine. The Federal Judicial Po-
lice also obtained a confession free Saens Ochoa. who told those authorities
that he was supplying drugs to Erasao Jaiae Garza. Cesar Pena Vera. Albino
Garcia and Cesar Cruz. alias "51 Mexico." all of whom have been killed as a
result of their connections with the drug traffic.
