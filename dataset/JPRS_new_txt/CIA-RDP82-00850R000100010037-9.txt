HELPARE OFFICERS TOLD T0 SCREEN ADDICTS WITH CARE

Kuola Lumpur NEH STRAITS TIMES in English 22 Dec 78 p 7 BK

[Text] Kuala Lumpur, Thurs.--welfare officers should study carefully the
applications from drug addicts for treatment at rehabilitation centres,
Welfare Services Minister Datin Paduka Hajjah Aisheh chani has said.

She added that drug addicts should not be allowed to use the centres as
"places of refuge."

The screening of applicants would ensure that addicts involved in crime
and secret society activities were not taken into the centres.

The Minister was speaking today at the opening of a course for 28 senior
welfare officers on the supervision of addicts at rehabilitation centres.

She said the aim of the three-day course was to acquaint welfare officers
on the problems of drug abuse and to train them in counselling addicts.

Joint Course

The course is jointly organised by the Government, the 0.8. Department of
State and the National Institute of Drug Abuse in the u.s.

Three American experts, Dr. Robert Dandy, Mr. Harvey A. Friedman and
Mr. Thomas K. Conway are attached to the Ministry for eight months to

help train welfare officers on the prevention of drug abuse and the
rehabilitation of addicts.

The Minister said under this programme, the welfare officers would take
over the training programme after the experts had left.

She said though the training system was unique to Malaysia, it could
serve as a model for South-East Asia.

"Exchange of personnel involved in the prevention of drug abuse and the
rehabilitation of addicts could take place among the countries in the
region so that they could study each other's methods.”

16
Datin Padukn Aishah said there were about 62.000 drug addicts in the
country and the nunber was on the increase.

Better measures, therefore. should be taken in the prevention of drug
abuse.

The number of rehabilitation centres would be increased to six with the
setting up of one in Huar and another in Sungsi Petani.

She added. however, that the centres were insufficient to handle the
increasing number of addicts seeking treatment.

The Minister also urged the public to cooperate with the Government in
combating the drug problem.

"The public should be ready to accept former addicts and give them
guidance and assistance so that they would be able to find jobs and not
return to drugs."

She added that voluntary organisations involved in efforts to solve the
drug problem, could do more to help.

found when Customs officers searched the H.V. Tongariro which berthed at
Lyttelton at 0600 on 5 October. Mr Justice Roper was told in the Supreme
Court yesterday.

His Honour fined Leslie Alan Wood. aged 23. a British deckhand on the ship.
“00. and recomended that he be deported on A charge that he actively
suppressed evidence to enable crew members of the Tongariro to avoid arrest.
He had pleaded guilty to the charge.

The police statesent of facts said that at 2120 hours on 5 October a Customs
officer saw Hood leave the acconnodation section of the vessel. As he did
so he put wrapping paper in his pocket.

when the Customs officer asked ﬂood what he was carrying he ran along the
wharf. The Customs officer gave chase and Hood stopped by a raiiuay wagon
for a short tint and then continued running.

After being stopped Hood was taken to the search too. where he again broke
away and ran off before again being apprehended. Paper and string were
found on the ground alongside wood. The paper saelt strongly of cannabis
resin.

Hood admitted renoving the paper iron the vessel. lie said that he was aware
that cannabis resin was concealed on board and when he found the paper he

realised that it had been wapped around a block of cannabis. he decided
to remove it free the ship.

Mr H. J. Knowles. for wood. said that Wood had taken the paper off the ship
to protect his shipeatea after he found it in n rubbish tin. At that stage
the cannabis had already been found by the Custous officers.

20
it was not a nutter which should havo been laid indictahly and oppstontly it

CALL FOR TOUGH!!! ACTION AGAINST NARCOTIC DRUGS

[Editorial Report BK] Rangoon WANNA ALIN in Bureeee on 17 Decenber 1978
carriee a 750-word article on page 3 by Heung lltin entitled: "Heroin and
the Death Sentence." The erticle begine with e deteiled report on new
drug control love which the Thai Government plane to introduce. The
erticle notee that eccording to new Thai lewe poeeeeeore of note than 100
green of herein are puniehabla by a life or death eentence while new--
facturere and deelere of opium and Iorphine ere punieheble by l to 10
yeare and 20 yeare to life ieprieoneent, raepectively.

The euthor eeye: "In ey opinion. the eanufacturer and the dealer are
equally ieportant ae the poeeaeeore end therefore they ehould aleo be
given eevere puniehnent. Although I do not nean to euggeet that they be
given deeth eentencee. it ie my belief that neeufecturere end dealere ere
the nain ceueee of drug addiction and that only by euppreeeing then can
we get rid of the problee of drug addiction. however eince lewe are eede
according to the cuetone and conditione of the country concerned. I ehould
not be arguing the point.

"I think the way ection ie taken againet nercotic druge in our country ie
too lenient eepecially becauee we beee our actione on hunene grounde.
however all prevailing cenditione nay call for heevier penaltiee. Thie
ie the point ell thoee who have erred ehould beer in eind. I wieh to

being taken ie etill lenient and in en appeeling eennar."

The author then goee on to note varioue effecte and eedicinal qualitiee of

Nuevo Laredo 31. NANANA in Spanish 29 Nov 78 Sec 8 p 2

[Text] While aembers of all the Tanaulipas police forces continued the search
for the dangerous murderer and drug trafficker. Artemio Gonzalez Pena. alias
"81 Artists." it was claimed constantly yesterday in this town that the afore-
mentioned outlaw had been arrested last Saturday in Ciudad Victoria. where

he was said to have been captured by Rural Police forces.

The coordinator of the agencies of the Federal Public Ministry. Alfredo Aaron
Juarez Jimenez. stated that it had been confirmed that Gonzalez Pena. alias
"31 Artists." had been arrested in Victoria. but that the case is being han-
dled with absolute secrecy. the reasons for which are unknown.

lbreover. the Federal Judicial Police coordinator in the states or Nusvo
Leon. Coahuila and Tamaulipas. Condr Margarito Mendez Rico. reported that
several warrants {or the arrest of "81 Artists" have been issued by district
judges. who want him for being presmd guilty of cot-sitting s criae against
health.

"31 Artists" has been charged with several murders. including the recent
death or the Federal Judicial Police auxiliary officer. Bonifacio Infants
Rodriguez. and Maria Luisa Balboa. Both were killed in cold blood by the
accused because, after riddling then with bullets. he mutilated his victims
by driving one or nore vehicles over then.

Since the day of that incident (20 Noveaber). the police authorities have
conducted an intensive hunt for the murderers. which ended last Saturday
when the Rural Police arrested "le Artistag" however. his whereabouts are
uncertain. because be may possibly be undergoing a completely confidential
"investigation. "

Yesterday. reporters from EL WA talked directly by telephone with members
of_ the State Rural-Police in Ciudad Victoria, but it was flatly denied that

"Bl Artists" was under arrest.

The oft-mentioned individual had previously been sought for having shot to
death one of the neabers of the troubled Guerra Barrera fanily of Ciudad

39
Miguel Alemsn; and he was, even earlier, mentioned as being guilty of on-
other murder in Matanoros. Taneullpse.

Traifickers Captured, Bribe Offered
Piedras Negras EL MARIO DB PW NEGRAS in Spanish 28 Nov 78 p 1

[Text] Torreon, Coshuile, 27 Novenber--The Pedersl Judicial Police under or-
ders from their commander, Luis ﬂuaracha Lopez, stationnd in Torreon, succeed-
ed in capturing six members or a well organized ring oi drug traffickers as
the latter, with his agents was conducting a search on the highway leading
to Ciudsd Juarez.

0
Huaracha Lopez and his agents discovered a red pickup truck near the village
of neraejillo. Durango. in which three highly suspicious individuals were
riding. They were arrested and each of then was questioned intensively. It
was learned iron the interrogation that three other persons were carrying a
hug; shipment of marihuana bound for Ciudad Juarez. Chihuahua. in a large
tan truck.

The Federal Judicial Police agents, neither slow nor lazy, set forth to
seize the shipment, and managed to catch up with the enormous vehicle in
the village of Hecqui, Chihuahua. where, after a difficult, dramatic. ope-
ration. they succeeded in arresting the three individuals in the tank truck
who were carrying the marihuana. The vehicle hora the initials "PEHBX"
[Mexican Pstrolsua]. and was bound for Juarez.

The total shipment amounted to 193 bags, equivalent to 5 tons, with an ap-
proximate value of 15 million peace in the underworld of drugs. The tank
truck had license plates V 37-28, and the trailer had deliberately been given

a different number, with plate 8'56-10.

The vehicles, the shipment and the six individuals responsible for shipping
the aarihuana to Ciudad Juarez were taken to Torrens, where the reliable
agents have their headquarters, so that the drug trsiiickers could be sub-
jected to close-questioning, in order to learn the exact connections that

they had with the "tat iishs"

The individuals under arrest first confessed that they were taking the drugs
to Ciudad Juarez; where they intended to seek underworld contacts.

41
Splendid work was aceomplluhed by the Federal Judicial Police commander ata-
tioned in Turreon, Mr Luis nuarachn Lopez, concerning whom it should be

stressed thatI in only a month and a half as head of his group in the lake
nren,he has succeeded in capturing 10 smugglers.

huarachn is a great asset hi the chief of the Judicial Police in the district,
Raul Mendiolea Cerccero. He was previously detailed to the troubled state
of Sinaloa, where he did outstanding work in eliminating criminals.

After the pertinent investigations and when the probes and interrogation of
the individuals in custody have been cOmpletcd, the shipment and vehicles

will be turned over to the Federal Public Ministry agent stationed in Sal-
tillo, Coahuila.

As another indication of the integrity of Huaracha Lopez, the drug traffick-
ers involved in this confiscated shipment attempted to bribe him with 10
million pesos, but did not succeed; because those now under arrest wanted

to impede the action of justice.

Suspects' Identities Disclosed

Nuevo Laredo EL MAMAMA in Spanish 29 Nov 78 Sec 3 p 2

[Text] The shipment of marihuana seized by Federal Judicial Police agents on
Monday morning at an inspection post totaled 5,020 kilograms, and a total of
six arrests were made of individuals involved in this new blow dealt by the

answer to the names of Ignacio Rodriguez Gusnzo. Francisco Carrillo Najera.
Jose Lopez Dusrte, Baudelio Rivera Miramontes, Bernardo Arreola Sslto and
Virgilio Molina Arrieta.

They are all being carefully investigated in connection with their recent
activities, inasmuch as they apparently shipped other similar voluses of
marihusna.

The entire groap was arrested at dawn on Monday, when a tank truck with li-
cense plates us‘aio, which was ostensibly carrying fuel, but had the 5 tons
of marihuana concealed in a false bottom, arrived at the Federal Judicial
Police inspection post located in the Vicinity of the highway between Torreon
and Chihuahua.

The vehicle was driven by Ignacio Rodriguez Gusnzo who. upon being questioned,
stated that a 1978 Ford pickup truck with license plates 03-1707 was follow—
ing him, and was occupied by five individuals who were guarding him as far as
the border. Several federal agents promptly boarded their vehicles and went
to where the truck in question was supposedly driving, and they had positive
results because they saw the traitickars‘ truck returning in that direction,
stopped it and arrested them.
