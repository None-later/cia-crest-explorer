SALESMN GETS 6-Yl-2Ml SENTENCE FOR CANNABIS
Brisbane Tlll-i COURIER-HAIL in English 15 Dec 78 page number not given

[Text] Sydney--A van salesman, who transported from a yacht to storage
what is probably Australia's largest detected importation of cannabis,
yesterday was sentenced to six years' jail.

Judge Torrlngton, in the District Criminal Court, said it was "grievious"
that Lawrence Roy Lamond, (so, of Lake Cathie, New South Hales, a success-
ful buslnessmau and notable sportsman, should have lent himself "to what
was obviously a major drug smuggling enterprise." He said: "You only
have to look at the pictures of the size of the pantechnicon and your
utility laden with sacks to realise what s huge enterprise this was."

Record Ilaul

he said the 2.73 tonnes of cannabis could have been sold for as low as
$14,500.000.

"But whether one takes ”(0,500,000 or $27 million (narcotics agents
estimated the street value to be $27 million) as the figure, this is

still probably the largest quantity of prohibited drugs ever detected
in Australia."

Lamond had pleaded guilty in a Petty Sessions Court on July 31 to having

had a prohibited import, cannabis, in his possession at Lake Cathie, on
June 10.

Sections 10(h) and 11(sale) (abetnent of offence) of the Narcotic Drugs
lmw.

The sentences are to be served concurrently.

in passing ludgment the Court observed that while activities denouncing
and suppressing narcotic drug abuse were being carried out in the whole
country as a national task the accused was apprehended while going about
in the city with such a big quantity of narcotic drugs for selling them.
For this reason the accused had to be given these penalties.

Law enforcement authorities seized 51 penicillin bottles each containing
five grams or heroin valued at K 25.500 from Soe Nyunt at the corner of
Maha handooln and 32nd Streets. He was carrying the heroin bottles in a
Horlicks bottle wrapped with a brown paper bag.

TRAFFICKER ARRESTED HIT“ DRUG RELATED MATERIAL NORTH 20 MILLION CRUZEIROS
Sao Paulo 0 BSTADO DB 8A0 PAULO in Portuguese 29 Dec 78 p 16

[Text] In Rio'a Seuthern Zone yesterday, Sao Paulo police arrested Berthier
Bacelar. one of the members of the Brazilian branch of the international
drug Mafia. Tomaso Boacettn. the ring's leader in Brazil, was arrested some
years ago. Two officers and an investigator from DEBRA“ [Greater Sao Paulo
Police Delegacy] took part in Bacelar'a arrest, which came about after almost
5 months of investigation.

Bacelar was in a Maverick. license number "Campinas RG-30 30." which he
purchased 5 months ago and used for his constant travel. The Sao Paulo police
began to follow him after he bought the car, and finally arrested him yesterday
on Avenida Ataulfo de Paiva. in Leblon.

Inside the car the police found 4 kgs of cocaine, several kinds of acid to mix
with it. scales and also material to use in distributing it, valued at about
20 million cruzeiros in all. The material has been sent to the Eboli Insti-
tute for examination.

Sao Paulo delegates Nelio Randolpho Angironi and Alberto Langerami and
investigator Levin had notified police delegate Osmar Pecanha, of the 14th
Delegacy of Rio's Southern Zone. that they were in his jurisdiction attempting
to locate the Sao Paulo trafficker. which they succeeded in doing yesterday
afternoon. Shortly after his arrest the DEBRAR police took Bacelar to the
delegacy. where he was booked.

The police did not wish the trafficker's statement to be released. nor did
the Sao Paulo police wish to be interviewed, claiming that they were not in
their own state and that they could say nothing because. according to then,
it would prejudice the investigation. which should be extended to other
states and even outside Brazil. They did not know precisely where they had
managed to arrest the trafficker. A Rio police officer commented that it was
"1n a hot zone." Avenida Ataulfo Paiva runs through the Leblon district,
where the major cinemas and restaurants frequented by Rio's high society are
located. The three DEBRAN police should remain in Rio a while longer. They
said they had other leads and wanted to obtain more information from the
arrested trafficker.

65
uncelnr has already been arrested four times in Sec Paulo. and convicted of
drug traffic. On his release by the Rio police he should be tronferred to
Sue Paulo. It is believed that the seized cocaine reached Sso Paulo across
the Hutu Grouse border. and that Berthier was assigned to bring part of it
to Rio for distribution to frequenters of Rio'a southern zone.

Police did not wish to reveal how they discovered Becelsr use a uenber of the
Brazilian branch of the drug Mafia. The ring was thought to be defunct.
since almost all of its uenbers in Rio and See Paulo had been arrested sale
years ago.

BAEZA: COUNTRY MORE A TRANSSUIPMBNT POINT THAN SOURCE OF MARIHUANA
Mexico City EL SOL DE MEXICO in Spanish 13 Dec 78 p A-lZ

[Text] Mexico is no longer the principal producer of the marihuana consumed
in the United States; however. it has become the transshipment point between
Central and South Americas and the United States for drug traffickers. EL
SOL DE MEXICO was told by Fernando Baeza, top official in the Office of the
Attorney General of the Republic.

The official based his statement on the fact that in 1977 the army and the
Federal Judicial Police had wiped out 75 percent of the marihuana and opium
poppy fields in our country and on the recent arrests of Colombian.Peru~
vian and Mexican traffickers in the statesofchiapes and Baja California
Norte.

According to this official. drug trafficking is being combated primarily
with electronic sensors located on clandestine landing fields operating on
the southern and northern borders of the capital of the republic.

These devices permit detection of the presence of airplanes and immediately
transmit their location to radar equipment and communications systems of

the Federal Judicial Police. This has made it possible to capture dangerous
cocaine traffickers who had been operating with impunity.

hacza Melendez spoke of the variety of systems used to combat drug traffick-
ing. not only the drug fields themselves but also transportation to another
country. which is always the United States. the natural border with Mexico.

The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic has requested the 0.8.
Government to keep an eye on airplanes or trucks which transport merchandise.
imported into Mexico. as on their return they are loaded with drugs. The
police authorities of that country have already been alerted, he said.

When questions in this capital, he said that several weeks ago the Federal
Police had intercepted their plans on a landing field near the Rio Usunecina
containing concaine valued at 380 million pesos; therefore. they had decided
to transport the drugs by highway.

He admitted that he had aade at least eight trips for which he had already
been paid 35.000 pesos. as he received 5.000 pesos per trip.

Me said that the presence of the child in the vehicle use for the purpose of
throwing off the police and was at the instructions of the group and thet the
signal he was to use every tine he arrived in Mexico City was to put on a
yellow and white baseball cap.

Later. the investigatora arrested Pedro Joaquin Colin Guruan who was carry-
ing an additional 10 kilograms of excellent-quality cocaine. According to
the experts. the purity of this drug permits it to be split 8 or 10 times;

Paris JEUNE AFRIQUB in French 10 Jan 79 p 65

[Article by Mustafa lawy: "Heads". Investigation by Rasola Lala'in
Antananarivo]

[Text] Africa, too, has its drugs. That is well known. But the-phenomenon
is expanding. The African authorities are becoming increasingly aware of it.

They have begun to organize regional meetings sponsored by the United Nations
Narcotic Division.

Drugs such as cannabis, khat. cola, hashish or Indian help are part of the
daily life of nany Africans. In Madagascar and East Afrite, for example, Rhat,
or "dream grass" is chewed in the for: of leaves. Certain varieties (there

are 27 in all) of khat grow almost everywhere and are scarcely distinguishable
fro: other herbs that serve as condinents in daily meals.

The clandestine cultivation of khat extends into every corner of Africa. the
countries bordering the Red Sea and Madagascar. 1n Senegal cannabis is grown
in all regions and its aarketing is increasingly well organized, despite the
severity of the law. The same is true of the Ivory Coast, where the nunber

of drug "affairs" officially recorded went from 98 in 1976 to 108 in 1977. In
Djibouti more than 80 percent of the inhabitants that initiates. According to
a recent United Nations report the African narcotics prevention departments

in 1976 seized some 457,132 kilos of cannabis (or an increase of 150,000 kilos
over 1974). compared with 1,747,431 kilos seized worldwide.

Another alarming phenoncn in Africa: some drug addicts are now resorting to
pharmaceutical products--a relatively new practice. Dr H. al-Hakia, an
Egyptian expert, calling Africa the contaminated continent, set up a cry of
alarn in Antananarivo. He is asking the African states to organise joint and
stricter control by calling especially for technical assistance from the in-
ternational organizations. According to Maurice Randrianone, a Malgasy ex-
port and one of the few Africans who sit on the United Nations Narcotics Coa-
mission. repression is not a good solution; it is necessary to reeducate drug
addicts and in particular to develop prevention.

in any case. this is not the way the Abidjan conference seens to have selected.
it recommends creating an interministcrial commission responsible for legis-
lating on the drug addict; should he he considered a delinquent liable to
severe penalties provided for by law. or a sick person who must be taken care
of? The fact that the question is still being asked cannot fail to cone as a
surprise. Added to the absence of any reference to tradition and the new pro-
found motivations pushing Africans into taking drugs, it rather expresses the
confusion of the leaders vis-a-vis a problem that seems to be beyond them.

Aphridisiac and Carcinogenic

Khat has becoae "very dangerous" in Madagascar, where its cultivation, which
extended over 32 hectares in 1972, today exceeds 500 hectares in the province
of Antseranana alone (Diego-Suarez). It exists also in Toleary and Bricks-
ville. According to Commissioner Maurice Randrianane. head of the narcotics
department, 60 percent of the persons arrested for drug consumption and 45
percent of the dealers apprehended are youths.

Khat has anorexic. central nervous system stimulating. indeed aphrodisiac
properties. But the regular consumer becomes "unfit" for any work. Accord-
ing to some experts khat contains carcinogenic components as well.

The United Nations Narcotics Laboratory in Geneva has agreed to finance the
creation very soon in Antananarivo of a research center that would serve to
detect--and thus to coabat--khat consumption.

AUTHORITIES REPORT “CREME IN WHMCMICAU mm
Oslo AFTENPOSTEN in Norwegian h Jan 79 p 0

[Text] Dangerous pharmaceuticals are still circulating anong narcotics
addicts in Oslo. The drugs were stolen from pharmacies and physicians'
offices. and the police does not exclude the possibility that use of such
drugs my account for the deaths of no less than six narcotics addicts in
the capital during the latter half of December. Autopsies pertorshd at the
Hedico-legsl Institute will provide the final answer to the causes of death.

According to the latest survey published by the Oslo Police. a tothl of 26
narcotics deaths were recorded in Norway in 1978. eight of which outside
Oslo. This is seven more than in 19710. which hitherto had the hiﬁeet
narcotics death rate.

P51 5. Berg, an inspector of the Oslo Police. told the m [Norwegian
Telegraph Agency] that 25 grass of the dangerous morphine preparation
aethadone chloride was stolen tron Pagerborg Barney in Oslo on 1? Deco-her.
and that the six deaths were recorded after that date.

This is on extresely poweer drug. and narcotics addicts who have got hold
of it say have misjudged its strength. The reason {or all this is probably
that several physicians used to prescribe rather small doses of aethadone

chloride to narcotics addicts until the National Health Service put an end
to this practice.

P81 Berg went on to say that narcotics addicts who are in need of narcotics
do not evaluate the danger of the drug they are using. and this say easily
have tragic outcomes. lie also sentioned that there is a relatively high
mortality rate among narcotics addicts in this country cospared to a few
other countries with which it would be natural to coapare Norway.

AUTHORITIES DISCUSS INCREASED HEROIN TRAFFIC IN OSLO
Oslo ARBEIDERBLADET in Norwegian 6 Jan 79 P 17
[Article by Petter Nome]

[Text] in the course of the last year. an assured market for heroin has
been created in Oslo. This will, no doubt. result in an increased
interest in Norway among international narcotics rings. So far the
Norwegian narcotics market has been marked by sporadic and irregular
supplies. We tear that this is changing.

Thu above statements were made to ARBEIDERELnnET by Hans Jacob Stang. H.D.,

n psychiatrics consultant to the outpatient narcotics treatment center in
0810a

Both the police and officials of the outpatient narcotics treatment center
are of the opinion that the hard core of young narcotics addicts in the
town is growing. bringing in its wake a higher crime rate and stricter

law enforcement in areas of narcotics addiction.

ﬂow is the drug situation in Oslo at the moment?

According to recent rumors circulating among narcotics addicts. heroin is
in short supply. No doubt. this is a marketing trick on the part of
narcotics dealers. They hold the drug off the market for certain periods
of time in order than to raise their prices. said Nikon Porno Berntzen.
administrative chief of the outpatient narcotics treatment center.

Highly Dangerous Drugs Stolen

Dangerous pharmaceuticals are still circulating among narcotics addicts in
Oslo. They were stolen from pharmacies and physicians' offices. The
police assume that stolen pharmaceuticals may have caused several of the
18 narcotics deaths that were recorded in the capital in 1978. Twenty-
five grams of the highly dangerous drug methadone chloride disappeared
from therborg Pharmacy Just before Christmas. Six narcotics addicts have
died in Oslo since then.

59
According to Porno Berntzen. many young people talk in enthusiastic terns
about methadone. considering it a good means in the treatment of morphine
addiction. but this is a highly dangerous drug. It is extremely difficult
to dose. and if it is mixed with other drugs. disastrous effects may result.

Death After Release Front Prison

According to an Berg. an Oslo police inspector. another problem is that
narcotics dealers dilute heroin and other morphine preparations. This is
done to obtain the highest possible price per gran on the illegal market.
Consequently, narcotics addicts will never be certain whether or not they
can tolerate a dose.

9&1 Berg went on to any that the police have several examples of labels
being changed on medicine bottles in areas of narcotics addiction. lie
also mentioned that the death rate among narcotics addicts is relatively
high in Norway compared to countries with which it would be natural to
compare Norway. The police also have examples that narcotics addicts
released from prison after some time without drugs die of an overdose
because they can no longer tolerate as much as before they were imprisoned.

Pdl Berg added that it often happens that narcotics addicts help one
another with injections. In such cases. these who inject may be charged
with involuntary manslaughter. perhaps even murder. if a friend or girl
friend dies of an oVerdose.

More Young People looking Down on Narcotics
What do we know about narcotics abuse ssong young people in Oslo?

Applications at the drug treatment center have doubled since 1976. said
For-mo Berntzen. The number of enrollments has increased by over 25 percent.
These are enormous figures in view of the fact that new areas of hardcore
narcotics addiction are still being formed in a number of other places in
Norway. Nevertheless. young people settling in Oslo account for the

majority of the approximately 6.500 applications that the narcotics
treatment center received in 1978.

A recent investigation by the National Alcoholics Research Institute
nevertheless seems to indicate that an increasing number of young people

in Oslo are looking down on drug use. In 197‘! more than 20 percent of the
young people in Oslo between 15 and 21 years of age stated that they had
tried marihuana or hashish. The figure for 1978 is 17.5 percent.. Stronger
drugs such as amphetamine, LSD and morphine preparations show an even
greater decline. Nevertheless. both the police and officials at the
narcotics treatment center feel that there is little reason for optimism.

Interpol has recorded an increase in cannabis use around nirope. according
to Per Carlson. assistant chief officer of the narcotics squad of the

60
Oslo Police. This may be due to the fact that the police have devoted
most of their attention to the harder drugs. A similar davelopsent is
not inconceivable in this country either.

There has been a decline in the number of heroin seizures on the continent.
but that is hardly due to a decline in the narcotics traffic. the enemies
of the police continue to change their tactics. Increasingly advanced
methods of smuggling and narcotics trafficking are being developed. methods
which are difficult to detect. Carlson said. tie also feared that inter-
national narcotics rings will take over acre and acre of the users’ own
marketing network.

Even if the number of new addicts has reached its peak. both the police and
the narcotics treatsent center officials fear stronger addiction anong
addicts. It is the established drug anvironnent that is becoaing increasingly
harder. more addicts are getting in a physically poorer condition than before.

Cooperation with Interpol
Uhet can be done to limit imports?

It is not a question of resources. Carlson said. No country t t has en-
countered theso problems has succeeded in coping with them. The police seek
to keep an eye on the areas of narcotics addiction, they have a good and
fruitful cooperation with Interpol and the police in other countries. However,
it is often more accidents that lead to the unravelling of narcotics cases.
The heroin market in particular creates big probleas. Herc it is a question
of enormous profits, even for very small quantities of heroin.

Clients Turned Away

The cold of winter also bothers narcotics addicts. The narcotics treatnent
center turns away up to 15 people a day who have nowhere to go for the night.

The problems of lodgings are enormous. said Porno Eerntsen. The lack of
space in the institutions is such that even those who are motivated to
undergo treatment cannot be accomdated. There is reason to fear an in-
crease in narcotics deaths in the coming year. Eighteen dead narcotics
addicts in 1978 must be considered a minim figure.
