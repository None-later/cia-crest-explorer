PRINCE SIHANOUK DISCUSSES FUTURE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA
Paris PARIS MATCH in French 26 Jan 79 pp 36, 37

[Interview with Prince Sihanouk. former chief of state of Cambodia, by
Magda Palacci-Bleier; time and place of interview not given]

[Text] [Question] You are going to go to France next February or March.
what do you expect from France today?

[Answer] France has always looked on me rather as a son, since I am French-
educated. l have always got along with the French. It is true that I have
not always been docile. I fought against the protectorate, but De Gaullo un-
derstood me very well. I fought against the protectorate and French colonial-
ism, but not against France. But there were Frenchmen who confused everything
and said, Sihanouk is bad, Sihanouk is anti-French, because he is fighting
against the protectorate and French colonialism. I never was against France.
De Gaulle. on the other hand, encouraged Ie in my nationalism. He had un-
derstood me. When De Gaulle came to power I had already finished fighting
against France. There was no more struggle between us. De Gaulle never de-
tosted me after the de jure recognition I granted the provisional government
of the Algerian Republic at a time when Algeria was not independent. The
peasants were still struggling against French colonialism in Algeria. At

the Belgrade conference in 1960 I recognized de jure Ben Khedda's provisional
government. De Gaulle said, "I like people to be independent and you want
Cambodia to be always independent. I understand that very well. And I under-
stand that you are going to encourage the Algerians to be independent. I, too,

want Algeria to be independent, since that is the desire of the Algerian peo-
ple. H

[Question] Are you going to neet with President Ciscard d'Fstaing?

[Answer] I don't know. That will depend on him. But I very much hope I can
meet with the Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Francois-Faucet. Because I would
like France to condemn the Vietnamese aggression and do everything in her pow-
er to induce the Vietnamese to withdraw from Cambodia. To do what she can.
diplomatically and politically: pressure on the Americans, pressure on the
Vietnamese. The Vietnamese are hungry. They lack rice, food and money.

Their finances are insolvent. So let France say to them, "He will help you.
But first you have to get out of Cambodia. Leave the Cambodians to settle
their problems among themselves. Then and then only will you have our aid."
1 would like France to put pressure on the Soviets.

[Question] How do you see that being possible?

[Answer] France can do a great deal diplomatically. She can make the Soviets
understand that they are complicating people's existence and that can become
dangerous. And then. France has only to say that the Nest. NATO. etc..are

not allowing the Soviets to bring about neocolonialism with the Cambodians.
because today the Soviets want to replace the Americans in our country. Just
as the Americans were neocolonialists in 1970. Now it is the Soviets. in
complicity with the Vietnamese. who are the neocolonialists.

[Question] From which government do you expect the mos.;

[Answer] The American government first. France next. and China. of course.
But the latter can't do much because it has worse relations with Vietnam and
Russia. China is large. she is strong. but for the same reason she can't
talk with the Russians, she can't talk with the Vietnamese either. She can't
attack them verbally. So I would have to speak to the others: the Americans,
the hnglish, the Nest Germans, France--all those who can help us.

[Question] You are going to meet with the American secretary of state.
Cyrus Vance. What is your agenda?

[Answer] 1 am going to ask him the same thing I asked France.
[Question] Are you hoping for an American military intervention?

[Answer] I am not hoping for that much. One doesn't always die for other
people's beautiful eyes. One only dies for oneself. The Americans made war
in our country for themselves and not for the beautiful eyes of Lon Nol. Look
at Lon Nol today, they are leaving him on the shelf. 1 repeat, the Vietnam-
ese are receptive to economic aid. They want money. Much money on the part
of the Americans. The Americans had promised them that once the war was over
they would aid them enormously in reconstructing their country. The Vietnam-
ese absolutely want to have that money, the total of which could be
31.000.000.000. 32.000.000.000 or even 33.000.000.000. 80 I would like to
get 31.000.000.000 for Vietnam. in the hope that Vietnam would then agree to
let go of Phnom Penh. I hope that in that way the Vietnamese will let the
Cambodians settle their affairs among themselves.

[Question] What do you expect from the coming meeting between President
Carter and Teng Hsiao-ping?

[Answer] This is a very good thing for us Cambodians. The Americans have
been our adversaries. but they are now our friends. It is formidable to have
as allies, today. China and the United States.

[Question] You, a prince. a king, allied with Columnist China--isn't there
a paradox in that?

[Answer] I have always been a prince apart. From the royal family. ariste~

crats, capitalists. That is why Lon Noi detested me. i was an extraordinary
prince because I am a little leftist. Also, they call me the "pink prince"

because I am neither comnist nor red. Moreover, the Chinese are used to my
personality and they don't see any paradox. They call me prince and even roy-
al highness: "We love you very luch because you love us very much. You have
never been too imperialistic. You are anti-imperialist and anticolonialist."

[Question] You are allied with Ceamunist China but you are net conunist.
You affirm that you do not understand couunism, so how do you define your-
self politically today?

[Answer] I am in favor of a leftish freedom, a socialism with an aspect that
is humane in some way. I am like Mendes-Prance. Not commnism for me, com-
munism is bad.

I could not live in China as a Chinese citizen (and no longer in luxury as an
invited guest, as in the past). For 1 don't understand communism and, not
understanding it, I couldn't be a good communist citizen. Moreover, the
Chinese would have no interest in aaking a comnist out of me.

On the other hand, as I an known to be independent, everything I say in their
favor will have influence on the international level. But if I became a
satellite of China, what I would say would no longer count. So I am useful
to them as Prince Sihaneuk and they are useful to me for Canbodia.

[Question] How do you see the future of Southeast Asia?

[Answer] I am not very optimistic. I would like all Southeast Asia-onot
just my Cambodia-~to be independent. China respects us, but as far as the
Russians are concerned, that's another thing. The Soviet bloc (Romania a-
side) and Vietnam are hegemonists; they would like to subjugate our South-
east Asia.

[Question] Do you expect military intervention by China?

[Answer] China will do what she can to help us. I do not want to interfere
in her affairs. If she is not interested in intervening physically, she will
at least intervene financially.

[Question] The Cambodian rebels (the KNUFNS) are pronising to reestablish
banks and private property. to reestablish family life and abolish compulsory
marriage. Principles that in a way are obviously in accord with your ideas--

[Answer] That is true, but the main thing is the country‘s independence and
the national dignity. To have a money narket. but not to be independent, what
good will that db? If our country is completely colonized by the Vietnamese,
they are going to plunder our national economy. I approve in theory of the
KNUFNS program. on just one condition: that it be truly well applied and
that Cambodia remain free and independent.

[Question] In 1975 you said you admired the Khler Rouge. And now?

[Answer] I still adaire thea for their courage and detenination and their
perseverance in defending national independence. But they have one great
fault. a rather serious fault: the violation of the rights of nan. But to-
day. for no, this is a second priority. First we have to fight for the re-
covery of -our national sovereignty.

[Question] Outside of De Gaulle, what chiefs of state do you adnire?

[Answer] Most of all Chou En-lai. lle was an aristocrat with great finesse.
I admire Mao Tse-tung also. He was a peasant, proud of his origins. lle had
retained the good sense and the intelligence of the peasant. Both of then,
Chou En-lai and Mao liked us very much. and we liked and admired then, too.
And then. I also admire Napoleon very auch and I have often coapared my exile
to his. '
