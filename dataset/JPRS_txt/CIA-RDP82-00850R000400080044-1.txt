FULLY INTEGRATED MINI METRO FACTORY AT BRITISH LEYLAID
Duesseldorf VDI-Z in German No 18. 1981 pp 772—773

[Text] A fully integrated manufacturing plant for the new Mini Metro auto model

has been put into operation by British Leyland at Longbridge. The largest, com-

pletely new complex in this plant is the Longbridge Heat works. in which the body
shells for the Mini Metro are built.

In addition. Metro production also required the construction of automated storage
for pressed parts, access roads and loading facilities for trucks and trains,
extensive modernization of paint plants and the attendant preparation areas, storage
for painted bodies, elevated conveyor belts for fitting, modernized assembly lines
for engines and transmissions, new final assembly tracks, dynamcmeters and water
test equipment, stands for emissions tests and a new final delivery check.

The pressed parts needed for the body are stored in a new, high-shelf storage area,
from which they are fed to assembly. The storehouse is equipped with an electronic
management system. This computer system supervises the inventory and its individual
positions as well as movements in the assembly areas. Data storage starts with the
suppliers. whose small computers are in constant communication with the main works
computer. Each pallet with pressed parts is identified at the time of delivery to
the central storehouse and reported to the computer by a controller with a "light
pencil."

The computer then automatically checks weight and dimensions to ensure correct lo-
cation in the storehouse. when the pellets are to be fed into the production stream,
they are picked up by forklift trucks at the storage area's delivery ramp.

The body subassemblies. such as sides, front ends. aubflooring, etc, are built on
special lines. The prefabricated body parts are then fitted together in automatic
framing jigs (Fig 1) and welded into a body shell-also automatically (Fig 2).

An important part of the preparations for large-scale production of the Mini Metro
was the modernization and expansion of the facilities for corrosion protection and
painting. A completely new facility was built for the preparatory treatment of body
shells. a second one for cataphoresis dip priming and additional facilities for
priming, paint spraying. undercoating and the protection of blind box sections with
a wax spray.

In the priming booth, the outside of the body is automatically sprayed in one
operation. In the next booths, only a few finishing operations have to be carried
out manually. Electrostatic processes ensure that the maximum amount of paint is
applied to the metal. The new paint facility is designed to process heat—hardsaing
acrylic paints.

Taking 2 years to complete, the huge final assembly hall at the Long bridge works
was completely rebuilt, and the floor area of the building was expanded by 25,000
m2. An adjoining building contains new fitting lines. The five old assembly lines
were replaced by three 335—meter-long. raised lines, each with about 60 stations
(Fig 3). The bodies, complete with their interior fittings, are taken to final
assembly on a ceiling conveyor.

In the final assembly area the supply of engines, chassis components, wheels and
other parts is controlled completely electronically. When the finished cars roll
off the line (Fig 4), they are first subjected to a test of safety-related coupon-
ents. such as steering and brakes. This is followed by checks of exhaust emissions.
the electrical system and various other functions. An electronic diagnostic system
speeds up the correction of possible faults.

The linal delivery hall has a floor area of 7,500 m2. Paint damage is attended to
in a special facility, which has its own paint oven and conveyor belt. The touched-
up cars are then put back on the line leading to the final check. Along the way, at
several stations. decorative paint stripes are applied and special equipment ordered
by the customers is installed (fig 5). After the cars have their final cleaning and
insportion, the conveyor belt takes them through spray booths in which they are
given a protective wax coat on the outside and the underside.

UPDATE 0" CURRENT AIRBUS SALES. DELIVERIES
Paris AIR 6 COSHOS in French 19 Sep 81 pp 2l, 23, 25, 27
lArticle by Regis Noye: "Airbus lndustrie Delivers Its 150th A-300"]

lTextl On 7 October. when Airbus lndustrie delivers to Eastern Airlines the 150th
A-JOO. there will still be 319 planes to deliver-~i.e., more than double--since #69
orders have been taken so far. This means that in a little more than 7 years, since
the delivery of the first A-300 to Air France. the European GIE [Economic Interest
ﬁroupl has become the Western world's second-ranking supplier of commercial trans-
port plancs, behind Boeing but ahead of Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas. Airbus In-
dustre's market share with the A-JOO and A-310 programs alone--thst is, the big
short-range and medium-range planes--is about 50 percent today; it only drops to

30 percent if the long-range market is added in. This indisputably represents a re-
markable performance. achieved in a period of economic recession in a market long
dominated almost entirely by American builders. Out of some 100 companies ap-
proached, 40 have already signed firm order contracts, and with the delivery of the
first A-300 to the Australian company TAA [Trans-Australia Airlines] on 1 July. the
EurOpean airplane is now in service on the five continents.

we note briefly that Mr Lathiere stated during the Le Bourget Salon that as of Air-
bus No 360 (which is to come off the line toward the end of 198A). Airbus Industrie
will have repaid to the member states the loans granted for development of the
A-lOO. Taking into account the further expenses of manufacturing and costs relating
to the A-3l0 program, the break-even point for the Airbus program is now at around
900 planes--a total very close to the estimated needs of the 40 companies that have
already ordered A-300/310‘s. The slowdown presently to be observed in the rate of
orders announced is esplained by the fact that Airbus Industrie's commercial efforts
were initially concentrated mainly on those companies that had not yet made their
choice and whose needs were urgent. Moreover. there is nothing disturbing about
this if one considers that the present order book represents a work load until the
end or [985, at which time the first customer companies will begin to think about
replacing the first planes delivered (the average lifetime of an A-300 is 15 years).

We note also that this slowdown is entirely independent of the present problems of
the American companies due to the recent air-traffic controllers' strike; because
its involvement in the United States is still weak, Airbus Industrie has felt no re-
percussions.

The two current preoccupations of the European 61!, which demands big investments
from its partners, are. on the one hand. increasing the rate of production, and on

b

FOR 0FF1C1Al.lEﬂE(MVLY

the other. development of the A-310, the manufacture of which has largely been
started, as we shall see (see article "First Airbus A-310 to Fly in March 1982").
The present rate is 4.1 to 4.2 A-300's per month; it will reach 5 next year, and

the will gradually rise to 10 in 1985-1986. At that time, the A 300-600 will al-
ready have replaced the A-300 on the line, since integration of it into the line is
planned for the second quarter of 1983. Finally, let us not forget that the near
future is also reserved for the A-320 program, the launching of which was officially
announed at Le Bourget and which has already received 25 conditional orders plus 25
Options for Air France.

The Order Book

We present on the following pages the tables. established by Airbus Industrie as of
31 August. summarizing the orders for the A-300/310. The grand total is thus #69
airplanes (318 firm sales + 151 options) placed with 40 customers, plus one not yet
announced. It breaks down as follows:

--A—l00: 316 planes (239 firm sales 0 77 options) placed with 32 companies;

--A-JlO: [53 planes (79 firm orders 9 76 options) placed with 11 companies. three of
which have ordered both A-300's and A-310's (Air France, Lufthansa and Kuwait Air-
ways).

The only news since the Le Bourget Salon is the recent conversion by Indian Airlines
of two of its options for A-300 BZ-lOO's into firm orders for two A-300 Ba-ZOO's to
he delivered in Sumnmr 1982. Furthermore, Kuwait Airways has changed 3 of its 12
orders for A-310's into orders for A-300 Cb-600's, thus becoming the first customer
to order the convertible version of the A 300-600.

We note also that while a decision in principle has indeed been taken by Middle East
Airlines for 19 A-3lO's (5 e la), the signing of the contract has been postponed un-
til the cnd of September, which prevents the order from appearing in the table.

The companies that are the biggest customers at present are Eastern (60 A-300's).
Lufthansa (6] planes. including ll A-300's and 50 A-310's), Air France (50 planes.
including 35 A-300's and IS A-JlO's).and then KL" (20 A-310's) and Swissair (like-
wisv 20 A-310'8).

As regards choice of engines, the following breakdown is noted:

--A-300 (all versions, including the A 300-600): out of 310 airplanes identified!
(236 + 74). 269 (202 9 67) have General Electric engines, and 61 (34 9 7) have Pratt
and Whitney engines;

--A-JIO: out of 133 airplanes identified1 (69 + 6b), 95 (66 6 69) will have General
Electrics. and 38 (23 + 15) will have Pratt and Hhitneys.

This makes a total of 366 (258 0 116) airplanes equipped with General Electric en-
gines and 79 (57 0 22) equipped with Pratt and Hhitneys; or as percentages. 82 per-
cent [or General Electric and [8 percent for Pratt and Whitney. There are nine con-
pnnies that have chosen Pratt and Hhitney so far: Austrian Airlines, China Airlines,

I. That is. the airplanes for which the engines have been chosen.

28. As of 15 August. the 167 Airbuses in service had flown more than 800,000 hours
and had made 550.000 takeoffs. which represents an average of 1 hour 65 minutes of
flight per takeoff. Twenty planes had flown aore than 10,000 hours, and the maxi-u-
recorded [or a plane was [6.000 hours. The rate of technical regularity of the
A—300's in service was 98.3 percent for the fleet as a whole, and 99.7 percent for
the top three companies. of the 148 deliveries as of 31 August (see table above),
46 were A-300 82's (including A with Pratt and Hhitney engines delivered to 5A8).

Three companies arr actually using planes leased from Lufthansa (by Air Algeria),
from "apex Lloyd (by Egyptair). and from Korean Airlines (by Saudi Arabian Airlines.

The IA9th plane will be delivered to Thai International on 29 Septe-ber. and the
150th. to Eastern Airlines on 7 October. As of 31 December, 38 A-300's will have
bcvn delivered since the beginning of the year; some 50 will be delivered in 1982,
which enables us to predict the delivery of the 200th in September 1982.

The ISOth A-300 Delivered Bears Series Number 152

The 150th Airbus A—300, to be delivered to Eastern on 7 October, actually bears ser-
ies number 152, bvcause of the fact that two of the planes built at Toulouse have
not been delivered (one prototype and No 3, owned by Airbus Industria,andpresantly
being used for flightetesting). It is an A-300 34-203 (the first of this type de-
livered to Eastern). equipped with General Electric CF6-SDCZ engines. This plane
has in fact, at the request of the American company, undergone structural modifica-
tions so that its takeoff mass can reach 165 t, as against 157.5 t for a standard
F4-200. Its layout is with 255 passenger seats--26 first-class and 221 tourist-
class. Eastern is in fact one of the companies requesting the biggest seat pitch in
tourist class.

The planv slartedon the assembly line on 5 March 1981. After going through the nor-
mal circuit in the Aerospatiale factory of St-Hartin (11 work doors on the line, 1
day of pressurization tests. painting, mounting of engines, runway building). it
made its first flight on 22 June before leaving for Hamburg (interior fittings).
from which it returned on 2 September.

It will leave Toulouse on 5 October in the hands of two Airbus lndustrie pilots; it
will fly to New York (with or without a stop at Gander), then on to Atlanta. where
it will be officially delivered to Eastern on 7 October. It is only at that moment
that it will become the property of the company. It will then go to Hiami--this
time with two American pilots in cansand--where it w.ll be placed in service on that
some day.

It is the 20th A-300 to be used by Eastern, but only the 18th delivered by Airbus
lnduslrie. since two other planes already in service come from Iran Air. The East-
orn Airlines contract comprises a total of 60 A-300's (DZ-200's and Bh-100/600's),
including 34 firm orders and 26 options. Six more planes will be delivered between
now and the end of the year.

FIRST AIRBUS A-JIO T0 FLY IN MARCH 1982

Paris AIR 6 COSMOS in French 19 Sep 81 p 29
[Article: "The A-3l0 Will Fly in March 82, the A 300-600 in lid-83"]

[Text] While the |50th A-300 will soon be delivered, the A-300 (220 passengers) and
A 300-600 (improved version of the A-300 82/34) programs are proceeding along. and
as we have already had occasion to note at various times (cf AIR ET COSMOS, Nos 870
and 872), the A-JIU is taking shape very rapidly at Toulouse. He mention first of
alllhstthe manufacture of these planes will be characterized by a phenomenon unique
in the world: the assembly of two big transports on a single line, not just one
plane as usually, even though these two planes have a lot of fuselage in cannon.
Moreover, it should be stressed that the integration of the A-310 into the A-300
32/84 line, and then the A 300-600, will be done simultaneously with a steady but
rapid rise in the rate of fabrication.

A-310

The final assembly of the first A-3l0 is presently taking place in the "Concorde"
room of the Saint-Martin factory of the SNIAS [National Industrial Aerospace Co].
Following the horizontal tail unit, the two half-wings, which arrived at Toulouse on
30 and 31 August, are now fixed to the fuselage, assembly of which was completed in
the first days of July. After receiving its landing gear, in mid-October the air-
plane will go to the new room (H90) that Aerospatiale has just built for the pur-
pose. in the medium term, of extending the present A-300 assembly line by transfer-
ring two work stations to it and in which airplane No 3 is presently under construc-
tion. The mounting of the fin, then of the engines, and finally, "turning on the
current," will de carried out successively in the H90 room. After checkout of the
systems, A-3l0 No I will leave the shop at the end of January; its first flight is
still planned for March or April 1982.

After its departure from the “Concorde" room it will later be replaced by airplane
No 2. whose wing spar boxes, already delivered to Breme by British Aerospace, are
being equipped, and delivery of which to Toulouse is planned for the beginning of
November. Likewise. the first four or five A-3lO's will be assembled separately so
as to break in the various operations perfectly and not impede the production-rate
increase on the A-300 line. The integration will be done in Autumn 1982, starting
with No S or 6. It should be noted in passing that a convertible version of the
A~310 is now being planned.
