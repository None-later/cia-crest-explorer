reactor] exceed substantially the dimensions of the core for WBR-MO. Fuel assem-
blies are larger than the fuel assemblies of vvsn-aso and contain 317 fuel elements
each arranged with a somewhat larger lattice pitch. The basic design parameters of
the core, assemblies and fuel elements are given below:

The achievement of the prescribed burnup fraction of fuel with permissible specific
thermal loads is determined entirely by the length of time the fuel elements stay
in the core. The operation time of fuel elements in vvsR-aao is three years. A
three-year run was also adopted for the main fuel reloading mode in VVBR-lOOO. Due
to high specific loads in the core of this reactor in the above~mentioned mode, an
average calculated burnup fraction of 39,800 Mw x day/T U is achieved, which is ap-
proximately 30% greater than the average fuel burnup fraction achieved in vvsa-aso.
For the first loadings of the core of the first VVBR-lOOO, it is planned to use a
two-year-run mode. In this case, the fuel burnup fraction will be 26,500 Mw-day/T
U and will not exceed the achieved limits.

After an experimental study of part of the fuel elements kept in the reactor until
a burnup of 45,000 Mw-day/T U, the VVER-IOOO reactor is changed to a three-year run;
in this case, the fuel component of the electric energy drops (according to calcula-
tions) by approximately 15% in comparison with a two-year cycle. The enrichment of
the makeup fuel is 3.3% (in the two-year cycle) and 6.4% (in the three-year cycle).

Properties of the fuel elements are adjusted over the cross section of the assembly,
since an increase in the enrichment and the dimensions of the assemblies of VVER-lOOO
leads to an increase in the nonuniformity of heat release in it. For example, in an
assembly with a fuel of 6.61-enrichment, the variation factor for the fuel elements
is 1.22. The arrangement of fuel elements with uranium of lower enrichment (3.61)

in a peripheral row and in corner spots of the next row lowers the variation factor
to 1.16.

The 109 assemblies have movable regulating rods (clusters) which are intended (by
analogy with $02 assemblies in VVER-ého): a) for rapid stopping of the nuclear reac-
tions; b) for automatic regulation in order to maintain the reactor power at the
prescribed level or for changing it from one power level to another; c) for compen-
sating rapid changes in reactivity by changing their position in the core.

‘
For the core variant with a three-year run, rods were installed in 42 peripheral
assemblies with a hurnable absorber (with respect to the mass of 12 of natural bor-
on) -- SVP. SVP rods are intended for lowering the breeding properties in the peri-
pheral assemblies with a fuel enrichment of 6.61 at the beginning of the run.

3.2. Coefficients of Reactivity of the Reactor

The reactivity and, consequently, the reactivity excess of VVER depend greatly on
the temperature of the core. As a rule, VVBR reactivity drops as the temperature
rises, specifically, when its power rises (this phenomenon is used for ensuring
safety in controlling the reactor). changes in the reactivity when the core temper-
aturc rises are caused by a number of phenomena occurring in the moderator-coolant
and in the fuel. First of all, it is the decrease in the water density with temper-
ature rise which leads to a decrease in the number of atoms of the moderator in a
unit volume and, as a result of this, to a decrease in the moderating ability of the
water. As a result of this, as well as due to an increase in the kinetic energy of
the nuclei of the moderator (hydrogen), when the water temperature rises, there
occurs ruggedisation of the spectrum of neutrons leading to changes in the neutron
cross sections of the nuclei of the fuel, the heat-transfer agent and structural
materials and, consequently, the neutron-physics characteristics of the core lattice.
Moreover, the rise of the fuel temperature increases the resonance capture of neu-
trons by the 2380 isotope (Doppler effect).

when the core temperature rises, the following effects play the most important role:
1) decrease in the cross section of neutron absorption in water governed by the law
l/v; 2) decrease in the cross section of scattering and density of water and decrease
in the moderating ability of the water connected with this; 3) decrease in the cross
section of absorption and fission of uranium and transuranium elements; 4) increase
of the resonance capture of neutrons in the fuel (Doppler effect); 5) decrease in

the cross section of absorption of neutrons by zirconium and niobium.

Some of these effects make a positive contribution and some a negative contribution

to the total temperature effect. Effect 1 makes a positive contribution due to de-

creased absorption of neutrons in the water. The decrease in the moderating ability
of the water gives a negative component which, as a rule, exceeds all positive com-

ponents of the temperature effect. Effects 3 and b also decrease the core reactiv-

ity. Effect 5 contributes a small positive component to the temperature effect.

An additional influence on the temperature effect of reactivity is connected with
the accumulation of plutonium isotopes during the fuel burnup. Isotopes 239Pu and
241Pu have large cross section of fission and absorption at a neutron energy of

about 0.3 e’. Isotopes 240Pu and 2‘2Pu have a strong absorption resonance at an en-
ergy of approximately] an As the core temperature rises, the resonances of pluton-
ium isotopes widen, but the inverse influence of resonance blocking is greater in
this case. As a result of this, the accumulation of plutonium isotopes makes a posi-
tive contribution to the temperature effﬁct of reactivity.

In calculating the neutron-physics chatacteristics of VVBR, several coefficients of
reactivity characterizing temperature and some other effects are introduced. As a
rule, these are: I) water temperature coefficient of reactivity k1; 2) fuel temper-
ature coefficient of reactivity kg; 3) water coolant pressure coefficient of reac-
tivity R3; 4) water density coefficient of reactivity kg; 5) power coefficient of
reactivity RS; 6) coefficient of reactivity with respect to the concentration of
boric acid in the coolant k5. ~

The temperature coefficient of reactivity k1 is defined as the ratio of the change
in the reactivity of the reactor to the change in the average temperature of water
and is designated as 69/8tnzo. It allows also for the changes in the density of
the water as its temperature changes, i.e., coefficient k4 is a component of k1.

The fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity k2 characterise the changes in the
reactivity of the reactor when the average temperature of the fuel changes and is

designated by 69/3t002.

The sum of the water and fuel temperature coefficients of reactivity is the temper-
ature coefficient of reactivity of the reactor 39/5: and is defined as the change
in the reactivity with changes in the average temperatures of the water and fuel in
the reactor which are identical when the core works at zero power.

It is evident that in experiments on a reactor, it is practically impossible to de-
termine the water temperature and fuel temperature coefficients separately. As a
rule, the total temperature effect is determined when working at a negligibly small
power and heating the water with main circulation pumps or outside sources of heat.
Coefficients RI and k2 can be estimated separately only by calculations or in in-
direct experiments using critical assemblies.

When the power of the reactor increases, there occurs an additional rise in the fuel
temperature which hecomes higher than the temperature of the coolant (Figure 3.2).
Moreover, there appears a temperature drop hetween the center and the surface of

the fuel element. The increase in the fuel temperature results in an additional
decrease of reactivity due to the Doppler effect. This decrease in reactivity is
called power effect, for which a special coefficient is introduced: k5 - dp/dN. The
power coefficient of reactivity is determined experimentally by measuring the changes

stant water temperature.

The power and temperature coefficients of reactivity do not remain constant in the
entire interval of working temperatures of the reactor. As the water temperature
rises, the absolute value of the negative water temperature coefficient of reactiv-

ity k1 increases, while the coefficient of reactivity k2 decreases (Figures 3.3 and
3.4).

The coolant pressure coefficient of reactivity in VVER is small, because water is

a weakly compressed liquid. However, when pressure in circuit I increases sharply,
for example, during preparations for the startup, it is possible to have a reactiv-
ity release sufficient for causing the runaway of the reactor. In this connection,
as well as for reasons of strength, the pressure increase rate in circuit I is nor-

malized.

Boric acid is introduced into the coolant for even distribution of the absorber over
the core. The coefficient of reactivity with respect to the concentration of boric

acid in the coolant k6 is defined as dp/BCH330 . The values of the coefficients of

reactivity for the reactors of the Novovoronezhskaya ABS are given in Tables 3.1

and 3.2.

Undesirable release of reactivity is possible in some instances, for example, when
circulation loops of the reactor are turned on during the startup or after repairs
with a lower water temperature or with a lower concentration of borie acid. For
example, the work [26] examines a calculated model of VVER behavior when the water
temperature at the entrance to the core is lowered. when the input temperature
dropped from 266 to 232 degrees, reactivity p 2: 0.002 was released in one fourth
part of the zone whose values decreased to 0.001 in six seconds. In published liter-
ature, they examined some cases of supplying colder water in an operating reactor

which wasln a critical state [27]. At the ABS "Dresden-2" (U.S.A.), where a boiling-
type reactor was installed, there were instances of the delivery of colder water in-

to the reactor when a reserve circulation pump was faultily turned on and the flow
rate of feed water increased spontaneously. The release of reactivity due to the

lowering of the water temperature in the reactor caused in both cases the runaway

of the reactor and the triggering of the safety system.

Compensation of the reactivity excess of boric acid makes it possible to reduce the
nonuniformity of energy release over the core and, consequently, to increase the
permissible power of the reactor and the fuel burnup fraction.

The decrease in the nonuniformity of energy release is determined by the fact that
boric acid solution changes the neutron-physics characteristics of the entire core,
while absorbing rods act chiefly on the neighboring areas of the core.

However, when compensating reactivity with boric acid, it is necessary to consider
the fact that the absolute value of the negative temperature coefficient of reactiv-
ity of the VVER decreases. This is caused by the decrease in the density of the
boric acid solution as the temperature rises, which leads to a decrease in the con-
centration of the absorbing nuclei of 108 in the unit volume of the coolant. This
effect intensifies when the concentration of boric acid is increased (Figure 3.5).

The presence of horic acid in the coolant increases somewhat the absolute value of
the negative fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity, since the absorption cross
section of the 103 isotope follows the law UV and, moreover, the absorption chiefly

or Inu-vncrgy thermal neutrons leads to the ruggedization of the neutron spectrum.
However, the influence of horic acid on the fuel temperature coefficient of reactiv-
ity is considerably lower than its influence on the water temperature coefficient of
reactivity. The water temperature coefficient of reactivity depends also on the
position of the 802 groups (Figure 3.6).

At high concentrations of boric acid, the temperature coefficient of reactivity can
become positive. The presence of a positive temperature coefficient of reactivity
in VVER-type reactors at sufficiently high concentrations of horic acid was observed
at a number of foreign ABS. For example, the "Jose Cabrera" reactor (Spain), at the
concentration of boric acid of 2.054 g“ 80 [kg in the hot state without power had a
positive temperature coefficient equal 20 .206‘10'4 degrees 8'1 [28].

It is evident that operation of a reactor with a positive temperature coefficient of
reactivity is extremely undesirable because its control and safety conditions become
complicated. Therefore, when calculating a VVER, the value of the concentration of
boric acid ensuring a stable negative temperature coefficient is selected.

very different in nature, which is determined by the arrangement of the

groups of assemblies in the core in relation to one another and order of their set-
ting. It should be mentioned that the effectiveness of group No 12 (see Figure 3.8)
which was selected as a controlling group of SUZ in the VVER-440 reactor of the IV

block of Novovoronezhsknya ABS at an average operating temperature of the coolant of

285 degrees C, remains practically constant in the entire interval of operating con-
centrations of boric acid.

when calculating the effect of boric acid on reactivity in the course of the run,

it is necessary to consider the changes in the isotopic composition of boron due to
the burnup of 103.

Boric acid introduced into the first loop at the beginning of the run circulates in
a closed loop and, practically, is not replaced (it is only gradually removed as

the fuel burns up). In this connection, its absorbing ability decreases, which has
to be taken into consideration.

Changes in the amount of the 103 isotope can be described by the following differen-
tial equation:

(“I T. N
774-0.» " ”+74" ' (3'10)

r”!!! O

 

where N -- concentration of the nuclei of the 103 isotope in the coolant, cm'3;

63 -- microscopic absorption cross section of 108, cm2; 4’ -- average density of _
the thermal neutron flux in the reactor, neutron/(cmZXsec); TJ.3 rrxoﬁr -- ratio
of the passage time of a unit volume of the coolant through the core of the reactor
to the passage time of the same volume through the entire first loop, including the
core of the reactor; No -- concentration of 03 nuclei at the beginning of the load-

ing of the reactor, cm'3; To -- total time of loading at nominal power, ef, sec;
T -- current time, sec.

In the equation (3.10), the term NOITo allows for the removal of boric acid in the
process of fuel burnup. It is assumed that the amount of the removed boric acid

depends linearly on the effective time of the reactor's operation. The solution of
the equation (3.10) has the following form:

 

% - exp (- 0.97.,.T/Tut) __
o (3.11)
_ 1.13:. " ""N-anTrJrrmn.

The relation Tmankon‘r can be taken to be approximately equal to V3.3 In new:
Vnera +-V s.a , where Vner -- coolant volume in one circulation loop of the
reactor: V a.o" coolant vo ume in the core of the reactor; n net -- number of

loops of the reactor. If the load works for 300 effective days, the burnup of the

103 isotope can reach 102 of the initial content and result in a lower effectiveness
of boric acid with respect to reactivity.

3.3. Requirements for the VVER Control and Safety System

The control and safety system (302) is the main system for ensuring nuclear safety
of the VVER reactor. It has two independent systems based on different principles,-

namely: a system of mechanical members of suz ($02 assemblies) and e boron regula-
tion system.

The 802 system performs the following functions: 1) controls the power of the reac-

tor; 2) compensates slow changes in reactivity; 3) performs emergency and planned
shutdowns of the reactor.

The fulfillment of these functions is ensured if the following requirements for the
802 system are satisfied: 1) reliable and sufficiently rapid compensation of changes
in reactivity connected with power control; 2) insuranoe of the compensation of re-
activity excess for fuel burnup in the course of the loading work of the reactor,

as well as compensation of the poisoning effects of the reactor by samarium and
xenon; at the same time, the temperature and power effects of reactivity during the
changes of the reactor power from zero to the nominal value must be compensated; 3)
in a cold unpoisoned state ofthe core, during the reloading of nuclear fuel, the
effectiveness of SUZ must be sufficiently great for reliable damping of the reac-
tor with a safe depth of subcriticality; a) the effectiveness of the control members
of the $02 and the rate of reactivity release must exclude the possibility of uncon-
trolled runaway of the reactor; 5) when the power of the reactor drops to zero, the
802 system must ensure the necessary subcriticality in a stopped hot reactor. In
this case, it is necessary to consider possible failure of one of several 802 drives
with jamming of the absorbers in the upper position and the possibility of spontan-
eous removal of the $02 absorbers from the core; 6) the speed of the introduction of
negative reactivity in emergency conditions must ensure the damping of the reactor

in the shortest possible time determined by the drop of the reactor power and ensur-
ing the safety of the jacket: of the fuel elements of the core.

The main causes of changes in the reactivity of VVER reactors and their contribution
to the changes in reactivity in percentages are given below [29]:

Doppler effect 1.4-1.6
Changes of average water temperature 0-1.0
Changes in the average water density 0-0.1
Control area 0.5
Operation reserve ' 0.1

Overall effectiveness necessary for con-
trolling the power of the reactor 2.0-3.3

Power changes during shutdown 1.4-2.7
Subcriticality of a hot reactor 1.0
Effectiveness of one absorber jammed in the

Overall effectiveness necessary for the shutdown

In VVER, the boron regulation system compensates slow changes in reactivity in the
course of the run, and the system of mechanical control members controls the power
of the reactor in nonsteady-state conditions and compensates reactivity during plan-
ned and emergency shutdowns.

The system of mechanical members of SUZ ensures the introduction of negative reactiv-
ity into the reactor under emergency conditions at a ratecfabout 22 reactivity per
second and ensures the release of reactivity during regulation at a rate of not over
0.22% reactivity per second.

The SUZ assembly of VVER-AAO-type reactors consists of two parts: upper -- absorber,
lower -- nuclear fuel. When setting up an $02 assembly, the absorber is removed
from the core and the fuel part replaces it. Thus, the lifting of an $02 assembly
releases the reactivity of the reactor both by reducing the absorption of neutrons,
and the by increasing the mass of the fuel in the core. The $02 absorbers have a
hexahedral jacket with "black" walls for thermal neutrons. The jacket contains in-
serts of horated steel which absorb thermal and partially epithermal neutrons.
The presence of water within the absorber ensures opacity to fast neutrons. The
SUZ absorber serves as a neutron trap: fast neutrons are slowed down in the water
and absorbed by boron without emerging beyond the limits of the absorber; thermal
neutrons are absorbed in the borsted inserts when they are passing through the walls .
of the absorber. If the absorber is removed from the core and the hexahedral water
cavity is left, the latter will also fulfill the role of a neutron trap. The effec-
tiveness of the water cavity is about 70% of the effectiveness of the $02 absorber
[30]. This effect is used during fuel reloading: before removing the absorber of
the SUE, two or three working fuel assemblies around it are unloaded in order to
create water cavities which compensate to some degree the unloading of the absorber
from the core and act as an absorber during the removal of the fuel part of the SUE
assembly from the reactor.

Key: 1. Loop

The effectiveness of SUZ assemblies depends chiefly on their location in the core

and on the core tem erature. As the fuel in the core burns up, as well as during

the hurnup of the 1 B isotope in the absorbers of the 802 assemblies, their effec-
tiveness changes. when a reactor is designed, the optimal order of successive set-
ting of SUZ groups is calculated for a definite number of assemblies in a group.

The criterion for determining the order of the setting of 802 groups is the insurance
of minimal nonuniformity of energy release over the radius and height of the core.

It is taken into consideration that the reactivity excess for the burnup is compen-

sated almost fully by boric acid, therefore, all 502 groups are in the upper posi-
tion with the exception of the last XII working group.

Figures 3.9-3.11 show cartograms of the arrangement of 802 groups in the cores of
VVER-hko of the III and IV block of NVAES, as well as Kol'skays A28. The VVBR core
in the plane is divided into three computation sectors with a 120 degree angle at

the vertex. The neutron-physics computations of the VVBR are done,as a rule, for
one sector on the assumption that the properties are repeated with a periodicity of
120 degrees in the remaining sectors. In each computation sector, the design numbers

ionization chanbers of the $02 of the Wax-1000 reactor of the
V black of WARS:
FOR10FFN1A1.USE(NVLY

The mechanical system of SUZ is intended for compensating rapid changes in the reac-
tivity (temperature, power, and poisoning effects). Slow changes in the reactivity
(fuel burnup) are compensated by changing the concentration of the boric acid solu~
tion in the coolant. For emergency situations, there is a high-speed boron injec-
tion system.

The total effectiveness of the mechanical system of the $02 of vvsn-looo must be not
less than the sum of the following effects:

Doppler effect of fuel when the power of the reactor changes from 0 to 1001 -- 0.013;

changes in the average water temperature of the first circuit when the power changes
from 0 to 1001 -- 0.016;

changes in the steam content in individual jets of the coolant in the core when
the power changes from O to 1001 -- 0.002;

effective reserve for nonsteady-state xenon poisoning and leveling of energy re-
lease -- 0.015;

effectiveness of a jammed bunch of absorbers -- not over 0.010;

initial subcriticality after the triggering of the safety system -- 0.010.

In order to allow for errors in the neutron-physics computations, the necessary ef-
fectiveness of $02 is taken 20% higher than the total sum of the above reactivity

effects and must be not less than 0.077.

4.1. Distribution of Energy Release in the Core

The distribution of energy release in the core is characterized by energy release
variation factors which must be known for determining the permissible thermal power
of the reactor (see section 5.3).

It is customary to consider the energy release variation factors with respect to the
radius, height, and volume of the core. According to the definition, the energy re-

lease variation factor in the i—th assembly over the radius of the core It,“ is
equal to

k4,! =3 01/6. (1.. 1)

where Q1 -- power of the i-th assembly; a -- average power of the assembly in the
core.

For boron-regulated reactors, the maximum value of It?“ varies within the limits of

1.2-1.6, and for reactors with regulation by mechanical members of $02 -- within the
limits of 1.5-2.1.

The small variation of energy release in boron-regulated reactors makes it possible
to remove a great amount of thermal power from the core. The variation factors of

energy release in the core are calculated on a computer for the entire run (see sec-
tion 7. 2). Experimental values of kr 1 are determined on the basis of water temper-
ature measurements at the outlet from the assemblies and the coolant temperature at

the inlet to the reactor. The values of the variation factors are computed by the
formula

-' (4.2)

where thx -- water temperature at the outlet from the i-th assembly; t3"J --
water temperature at the inlet to the reactor from the j-th circulation loop; 6 --
mass velocity in the j-th circulation loop; g1 -- mss velocity in the i-th assembly;
in -- number of circulation loops; n -- number of fuel assemblies in the core.

For measuring the water temperature at the outlet from the assemblies, VVER are
equipped with a temperature monitoring system. Temperature measurements are done
by thermocouples which are sufficiently efficient in a wide temperature range under
the conditions of neutron and gamma irradiation. Chromel-copel and platinum-plati-
norhodium (101 Rh) thermocouples are used most widely. In vvsn-aao, the outlet wa-
ter temperature is monitored for about two thirds of the assemblies of the wire
core, and in VVER-lOOO -- at the outlet of all assemblies. The water temperature
at the inlet to the core is measured in the circulation loops. Depending on the
steam load of the steam generators, the number of working loops, and the hydraulic
resistance, certain deviations of the inlet temperature in the loops are possible.
In practical calculations, the water temperature at the inlet to the core is taken
to be equal to the average value for all working loops of the reactor. In averaging,
differences in the water flow rate in the loops are taken into considerations.

The flow rate of the coolant through the assemblies of the core are determined on

the basis of the hydraulic characteristics of the assemblies (see section 5.2). The
power of the assemblies under operating conditions is calculated by the energy re-
lease variation factors at a known average power of the assemblies of the core. The
distribution of energy release over the height of the core is usually obtained by
calculations for the entire run (see section 7.2). Experimental distribution of en-
ergy release is determined in special measuring channels with the aid of the sensors
of the in-pile monitoring system. From 12 to 36 measuring channels are installed in
the core of VVER-ébo. The measuring channel is a stainless steel tube with the lower
end plugged up passing through the lid of the reactor into the central tube of the
working assembly. In the VVBR-IOOO assemblies, the detectors of the in-pile monitor-
ing system (VRK) are arranged not in the central tube, but in a special channel of
energy release measurements. The VVER-IOOO reactor of the V block of NVAES has 31
measuring channels connected to the VRK system (see Figure 3.12).

The distribution of the neutron flux density and energy release along the height are
measured by activation and emission detectors, as well as by ionization chambers
[31]. Calibrated copper wires with a constant mass per unit length are used as ac-
tivation detectors. The wire is irradiated in the measuring channel in the course
of time sufficient for its saturation by the 6“Cu isotope, after which it is removed
from the core and cooled for a while for the decomposition of the short-lived cop-
per isotopes. The distribution of beta-activity through the length of the wire mea-
sured after this will correspond to the distribution of the neutron flux density
with the height of the measuring channel at the moment of the irradiation of the
wire.

In VVER, emission detectors -- direct charge detectors (nsz) -- are used widely.

The operating principle of DPZ is based on the appearance of an electric potential

in a detector consisting of an emitter and a collector during the bets-decomposition
of the neutron-sensitive emitter. Rhodium and vanadium are usually used as DPZ emit-
ters. DPZ are small and sufficiently simple secondary devices. A drawback of the
direct charge detectoris their rather great inertia. In the series-produced VVBR-bbo,
each measuring channel has four rhodium DPZ 250 mm long and one vanadium DPZ 2500 mm
long. Rhodium detectors are intended for measuring the distribution of the neutron
flux density with the height of the channel, and vanadium detectors are intended

for measuring the total neutron power in the channel. More0ver, the distribution

of the neutron flux density with the height can be measured by moving the DPZ along
the length of the channel.

For practical monitoring working conditions of the fuel elements, it is necessary to
know the energy release distribution whose correlation with the density distribution
of the thermal neutron flux cnanges as the fuel burns up. At the initial moment of
burnup, the neutron flux density and the specific energy release are cannected by
the relation

W=W§5Ngh (l5 3)

where 655 -- fission cross section of 2350; N35 -- initial concentration of 2350
nuclei.

Allowing for the accumulation of 239Pu and 261Pu and 2350 burnup, the relation (4.3)
assumes the form

V = (p (agN. + 05, N” + of, N“). ((0 .5)

where 6 and 6 -- fission cross sections of Pu and Pu; N 5' N39 and N41 --
concentggtion ofl 2350, 239?u and 261Pu nuclei, respectively. 2

In order to proceed from the measured density distribution of the thermal neutron
flux to the distribution of energy release, it is necessary to perform conversions
which, as a rule, are done on the computer and allow for the burnup of 2350 and accu-
mulation of plutonium isotopes. For this purpose, information from DPZ is loaded
into the computer which promptly processes the data and informs the operator about
the results of measurements with consideration for the burnup of the DPZ emitter.

In order to simplify the computation programs of information (controlling) electronic
computers, it is desirable to use, in addition to the detectors measuring the den-
sity of the thermal neutron flux, detectors whose indications characterise directly
the energy release in the fuel elements surrounding the channel. Energy release in
fuel elements is characterized unambiguously by the flux density of fast or resonance
neutrons which can be measured with the aid of modernized DPZ or ionization chambers.
For example, a DPZ with an emitter of silver surrounded by a cadmium jacket for cut-
ting off thermal neutrons registers chiefly the density of the flux of resonance neu-

trons which, in the final analysis, is proportional to the energy release in the sur-
rounding fuel elements.

Reduction of the factors of variation along the radius R, and the height k: and the
volume factor of variability kv - krkz is of great practical significance from the
view point of the possibility of increasing the reactor power and the fuel burnup
fraction. Therefore, the work on the leveling of VVER power is being done continu-
ously.

In VVER, a zonal principle of load assembling is used (see section 7.1), which makes
it possible to level energy release along the radius of the core and, in combination
with boron regulation, to reduce the volume nonuniformity of energy release.

In the process of fuel burnup, there occurs additional self-leveling of energy re-
lease due to the nonuniformity of burnup proportional to energy release, and due to
the nonuniformity of the manifestation of the poisoning effect and the power effect
of reactivity. For an example, Figure 4.1 shows the changes in the calculated and

experimental values of maximum variation factors of energy release kglx and k":‘

'the variation factors decrease in the course of the loading operation. Some increase
in the variation factors at the end of the run is due to the gradual withdrawal of

dence of the height distribution of energy release on the presence of partially

Figure 4.3 shows the distribution curve of energy release obtained in the measuring

In conclusion, let us note that the leveling of energy release increases the proba-
bility of the appearance of xenon oscillations(see section 4.3). Xenon oscillations
are the effect of periodic redistribution of power over the core volume caused by
the feedback between the power and concentration of 135Xe.

In VVER-440, the probability of xenon oscillationsis small and if such oscillations
occur, they are aperiodic in nature, have a small amplitude, and attenuate rapidly.

A distinguishing characteristic of VVER-IOOO is the possibility of the occurrence of
spatial xenon oscillations of power in the volume of the core. The probability of

the occurrence of xenon oscillations increases as the dimensions of the reactor in-
crease in the case of disturbances in the distribution of power. The greatest

field disturbances in VVBR-IOOO occur in the operation mode with changes in the
level of power, for example, the lowering of power from 100 to 501 for a while with
subsequent increase to 100% (Figure b .4). The figure shows clearly the appearance

of deformation in the axial distribution of the neutron flux caused by transitional
xenon processes and the shifting of the SU! regulating members.

Evidently, in a number of cases, in order to reduce the dimensions of disturbances
in power distribution, it is expedient to lower the regulating rods completely, and
to compensate their influence by changing the concentration of boric acid during the
entire operation time of the reactor at a lower power.

A sufficiently developed system of in-pile monitoring with results processed by a
computer is a component part of the WER-IOOO control system. The operational infor-
mation about the distribution of power over the core makes it possible to correct

the developing deformations of the field in time. Radial and azimuthal deformations
of power distribution can be corrected by withdrawing or lowering certain groups of
absorbers. Height deformations can be corrected with the aid of a special group of
control rods Y with a half-height of the absorbing substance by changing their posi-
tion along the height of the core (Figure 6.5).

4.2. Changes in the Reactivity of the Reactor During Its work at Full Power

When a reactor works at full power, besides the changes in the reactivity described
in section 3.2, its reactivity changes as a result of the effects of poisoning and
slagging of the core.

As a result of the fission of uranium and plutonium nuclei, there form various fis-
sion fragment nuclei and product nuclei of the radioactive decay of fragments. It
is possible to isolate two main groups (see Chapter 1) among fission fragments and
products of their decay whose accumulation in the core affects substantially neutron-
physics characteristics of the reactor. The first group includes 1351e and 1498m
nuclei which have large thermal neutron absorption cross sections. The decrease in
the reactivity of a reactor as a result of the accumulation of 135Xe and 1598m nuc-
lei is called poisoning. Poisoning by 135Xe is particularly important in transi-
tional processes, because the half-life periods of 13SXa and its predecessor 135!

are relatively small. The second group of fission fragments and products of their
radioactive decay includes stable and long-lived isotopes which have relatively small
neutron absorption cross sections. The decrease in the reactivity of a reactor
caused by the appearance of fission products during the burnup of fuel is called
reactor slagging.

Reactor Poisoning. Poisoning of a Reactorby135Xe. Chapter 1 gives the chain of

the formation of 13SXe from 351. A small portion of 1351 does not form directly
during fission, but as a result of the radioactive decay of another fragment, 135Te.
The half-life of 1”Ta is very short, therefore it is assumed in calculations that
the entire 1351 forms directly during fission. Allowance is made in calculations
that a small part of 135Xe nuclei forms directly during fission. The balance of 1351
and 135Xe nuclei in the reactor is described by the system of differential equations:

In a rigorous examination, the values of EEfT and ‘ke must be averaged over the
spectrum of thermal neutrons in the reactor which is determined by the temperature
of the fuel and coolant. concentration of boric acid in the coolant, layout of fuel
assemblies in the core, concentration of 135Xe nuclei, etc. As a rule, the neutron
spectrum is calculated in one or another degree of approximation on a computer (see
Chapter 7).

Under the condition that Esz - const; QPT = const (i.e., under the condition of
constancy of the power and the neutron spectrum), equations (é.S)-(6.6) can be solved

Key: 1. Per unit value power.

Figure 4.6 shows curves of steady-state 135Xe poisoning of the core of VVBR-bbo.

when the reactor works at a steady power of 100%, the maximum steady-state poison-
ing equal to #1 is established approximatel; after #0 hours. At this moment, equili-
brium is established in the formation of 13 Xe nuclei from 1351 and their disappear-
once as a result of radioactive decay and burnup by the neutron flux. Pigure 6.7
shows the dependence of steady-state 13SXe poisoning of VVER-ébo on its pover.

when the power of the reactor changes from N1 to N2, the balance of 1351 and 135Xe
nuclei is disturbed, which causes transient processes accompanied by changes in the

reactivity of the reactor. When the pouer decrruses, the reactivity of the reactor
also decreases, because, as a result of the decrease in the neutron flux density,

32

FORiOFFﬂJAl.USE¢NNLY
the burnup of xenon by neutrons decreases, while its yield from 135T, whose amount
at the initial moment is determined by the former power level, does not change,
which leads to an increase in the concentration of 13SXe nuclei and increased poi-

soning. This phenomenon is called iodine pit.

The greatest depths of the iodine pit (6.5%) occurs when the load of the reactor is
reduced from 1001 to zero (Figure 5.8 a), which is achieved nine hours after the
drop of load. Henceforth, as the number of 1351 nuclei and, consequently, the num-
ber of the forming nuclei of 135Xe decrease, the reactivity increases. "hen the
power is increased, the poisoning of the reactor by xenon first decreases (depoison-
ing takes place) due to intensive burnup by the increased neutron flux of 135Xe,
whose yield from 135I remains for some time corresponding to a lower level of power.
Then, the increased yield of xenon nuclei from iodine compensates the released reac-
tivity and brings additional poisoning due to increased concentration of 135Xe nu-
clei (see Figure 4.8d). The maximum depoisoning can reach 0.6-0.7! reactivity.

In plotting the curves in Figure 4.8, it was assumed that, before changing the power,
the reactor operated in a steady-state mode for a long time (2-3 days). The origin
of coordinates was selected as an initial point for all curves, and for determining

the total poisoning of the reactor by xenon, it is necessary to shift all points of
curves in the direction of negative reactivities to a corresponding steady-state
poisoning. If the change in the power in the reactor oc<urred before the establish-
ment of steady-state poisoning, then the following should be done for determining
the total poisoning of the reactor by 135Xe: to determine from curves in Figure 6.6
the poisoning of the reactor by xenon at a given power at a given moment of time
and, using Figure “.7, to find to what steady-state power level the obtained value
of poisoning corresponds. Then, at the established value of the steady-state power,
the parameters of the transient xenon process of interest to us are determined from

Figure 4.8.

If the reactor was stopped for a longer time (more than 1.5-2 days), then practical-
ly the entire iodine and xenon decay, and curves in Figure 6.6 must be used in cal-
culating the poisoning of the reactor after its startup. If the reactor stopped

for less than 1.5 days, then for estimating its xenon poisoning after subsequent
power increase, it is sufficient to have in mind that the total poisoning of the re-
actor tends to the steady-state poisoning at a given power. A method for a more ac-
curate estimation of poisoning for such cases is given in work [32].

The time of attaining the maximum depth of the iodine pit depends on the percentage

of the lowering of the reactor power. For example, if the total 100% load is drop-

ped, the maximum of poisoning is attained after nine hours, but if the load is drop-
ped from 100% to 50%, it is attained after five hours (see Figure 4.8a). The total

time of 135Xe processes is apprOximately equal to 60-50 hours.

Let us give an example of calculating the poisoning of a reactor by the 13SXe iso-
tope.

Problem. vsz-aao worked at 100% power (1375 Hw thermb in the course of 10 days.

Solution. Before the shutdown of the reactor, steady xenon poisoning equal to 407.
became stabilized (see Figure 4.6). Three hours after the drop of the load to 25%,
the depth of the iodine pit reached -l.8'l. (see Figure 4.8a), and before the reactor
power was increased to 757., xenon poisoning was equal to(-la), + (-1.81) - -5.81 of
reactivity. After 1.5-2 days of power operation of the reactor, xenon poisoning
dropped to the steady-state value at this power, i.e., to 4.75%.

Transient xenon processes have a substantial effect on the maneuversbility of the
ABS.

Hodern water-moderated water-cooled power reactors work, as a rule, in the boron re-
gulation mode, which makes it possible in the steady-state mode to withdraw almost
all 8112 assemblies from the core. Among the 802 groups, only the controlling group
remains in a semi-inserted state in the core, which compensates reactivity distur-
bances connected with the maintaining of the necessary power level of the reactor.
The effective reactivity excess of the controlling group of the 802 is equal to
~0.5%. When the load variations are small, the effective reactivity excess is
quite sufficient for compensating the temperature and power effects and the poison-
ing effect in the transient xenon processes. When the reactor power drops greatly,
the depth of the iodine pit becomes greater, which can lead to the necessity of im-
mediate removal of boric acid from loop I to compensate poisoning.

for an example, let us emanine the above problem in a somewhat modified form.

Problem. WEIR-MO operated at 100% power in the course of 10 days; the concentra-
tion of boric acid in the coolant was 2 g/kg, and the effective excess of the 802
control group was 0.47.. As a result of the triggering of the scram system, the
power of the reactor dropped to 25%. After three hours, power was increased to 752
of the nominal power. What actions must taken by the operating personnel for chang-
ing the reactivity in order to ensure the operation of the reactor at the above-men-
tioned power levels?

Solution. Steady-state 135m poisoning and the power effect were compensated during
the operation at 1007. power by a boric acid solution and by the control group. When
the load drops from 100 to 257., a power effect equal to +1.21 is released (see sec-
tion 3.3). However, this not enough for compensating xenon poisoning which will
reach -l.87. after three hours (an iodine pit maximum equal to 4.251 is attained
after six hours during operation at 257. power -- see Figure (has). In addition, it
is necessary to release the effective excess of the control group equal to +0.h'l.,
and also +0.21 reactivity by removing boric acid from the reactor. Moreover, at the
expense of the removal of boric acid, it is necessary to release +1.21 reactivity
three heurs later for compensating the power effect during the subsequent increase
of power (if there are no other conditions, it is necessary to count on a power of
1001) and 40.557. of reactivity for fully cowensnting the iodine pit (-2.25%), since,
as a rule, the exact moment of the emergence of the reactor to a higher power level
is not known, and it is quite probable that this will occur at the moment when the
maximum of the iodine pit is attained. Thus, in order to compensate +0.2+l.2+0.451
“1.852 reactivity, it is necessary to lower the concentration of boric acid in the
reactor by 1.38 g/kg (GP/M3330 *3'10'2 kg/g) by delivering 67 m3 of pure water to
loop I calculated by formula (2.20)]. When three feed pumps with a total capacity
of 14 /h are turned on, the delivery of such a volume of a volume of .water requires

FOR (“TRIAL NSF ONLY

4.8 hours, in which case the concentration of boric acid will decrease by 1.58 g/kg
after three hours and +1.26% of reactivity will be released which is temporarily
compensated by inserting SW assemblies into the core.

Since the power of the reactor will increase to 75% after three hours, -0.81 of the
reactivity released as a result of the renoval of boric acid will be used for con-

pensating the power effect and 0.2% -- for compensating poisoning. The effective
excess of the control grOup will. be +1.26-0.8-0.2% - +0.26%.

Thus, the equilibrium concentration of the nuclei of samarium No Sm does not depend
on the neutron flux and, consequently, on the reactor power. However, the reactor
power determines the time of the attaining of the equilibrium concentration of 1“98-.
Figure 6.9 shows the curves of the poisoning of the vvsn-aao core by samariun for
the first startup from which it follows that the equilibrium concentration of 1599-
nuclei and steady-state (equilibrium) poisoning, which is 0.82% for vvsn-aso, is
attained in the course of 30 effective days when operating at a steady power. The

The change in the reactor power from N1 to N2 (Figure 4.10) causes slow transient
processes connected with the changes in the numbers of 1‘9Pm and 1’09s“! nuclei in the
core. The phenomenon of the lowering of the reactivity of the reactor when its
power decreases due to the disturbance of the balance of 1‘9Pm and 1‘9Sn nuclei, by
analogy with the iodine pit, is called promethium pit. The greatest depth of the
promethium pit (of the order of -0.51) is attained when the power of the reactor de-
creases from 100% to zero (see Figure 4.10a). and the total transformation of the
formed 149Pm into 149Sm occurs approximately in 15 days after the drop of the load.
During this time, the ssmsrium nuclei formed from promethium during the shutdown
time are added to the samarium nuclei accumulated during the time of power operation.

The l498:1: isotope is stable, therefore, at the zero power of the reactor, the number
of samarium nuclei remains constant. When the power drops partially, the depth of

the promethium pit is smaller, because part of the accumulated samarium is burned up
by neutrons.

the curves in Figure 5.10 presuppose that steady-state poisoning by 149Sn is attained
before the change in the reactor power.

The decrease in the time of the onset of the maximum of the promethium pit as the
values of the power N2 increase in Figure 4.10 should not be misleading, because

the effective time h k\ question, and not the calendar time. The calendar time of
the onset of the maximum of the promethium pit remains constant (15 days). As the
power of the reactor increases, a samarium overshoot (reactivity increase) is observ-
ed, which is explained by the change in the rate of the burnup of samarium by neu-
trons and the rate of its accumulation from promethium. The maximum ssmarium over-
shoot can reach 0.25% during the time of the order of five hours after the rise of
the reactor power from zero to 1002, assuming that the reactor was shut down for 15
days and the concentration of samarium stabilized as constant.

Let us give an example of the computation of the poisoning of a reactor by the 1"98m
isotope.

Problem. After 40 effective days of operation VVER-hho was shut down for two days.
Before the shutdown the reactor operated in the course of 20 days at a 752 power.
After the startup, the reactor was brought to a power of 501. The poisoning of
the reactor by samarium has to be determined.

Solution. Directly before the shutdown of the reactor, steady-state samarium poison-
ing was established in the core, since the transient process connected with the em-

ergence of the reactor to the 75% power level occurred 20 days before the shutdown
of the reactor (more than 15 days) and, moreover, in 40 effective days, steady-state

poisoning by 149Sm became established. From Figure 4.9, we deter-ins the steady-
state poisoning by samarium equal to -0.821. From Figure b.10h, we find that dur-
ing the two calendar days of the shutdown of the reactor (2 days. 751/1001 - 1.5 ef-
fective days) the depth of the promethium pit reached -0.21. The total poisoning of
the reactor by samarium directly before the startup is equal to -.82% + (-0.21) -
-1.022. when the reactor reaches the 50% power level, samerium burns up and approx-
imately after 30 effective days of operation (30 eff. dayso1001/501 - 60 days) the
poisoning drops to the steady-state value of -0.821.

Reactor Slagging. The composition of stable and long-lived fission fragments --
slags -- forming during the fission of 2350 nuclei is given in Chapter 1. The accu-
mulation of slags in the fuel is proportional to the neutron fluency and is an energy
characteristic of nuclear fuel.

The unit of measurement of fuel burnup is the amount of thermal energy released
from 1 t of fuel in terms of metal in 26 hours (Mw-days/tuo. Another frequently
used unit is the slag mass accumulating in l t of uranium (kg/t0). Puel burnup is
directly connected with the number of nuclear fissions of the fiasionable isotope:

The energy carried away by neutrinos is not included in the value of the energy of

5.3. VVER Control and Haneuverability

In VVER, power control is facilitated by the negative temperature effect of reactiv-
ity. The temperature effect of reactivity in a number of practically important cases
is capable of compensating power perturbation during emergency situations without

the interference of control devices. '

First, let us examine the processes in the reactor after a load perturbation without
consideration for the influence of the power effect of reactivity. As the load of
the turbo-generators increases at a constant power of the reactor, the flow rate of
steam per turbine increases, and the steam pressure in the steam generators decreases.
The decrease in the steam pressure and, consequently, of the saturation temperature
increases the thermal head of the steam generator and the removal of heat from the

I circuit, which, in turn, lowers the average temperature of the coolant in the core.
The reactivity released during the lowering of the coolant temperature is spent on
increasing the power of the reactor. After the termination of the transient process,
the average temperature of the coolant in the core becomes equal to the original val-
ue, and the power of the reactor falls in line with the increased removal of heat
from the steam generator. The self-regulation process has the nature of damped os-
cillations whose amplitude and period depend on the scale of changes in the load and
the value of the negative temperature effect.

The negative power effect of reactivity, which appears when power increases, compen-
sates to some degree the effect of the temperature effect. Therefore, the stabili-
zation of the parameters of the reactor plant actually occurs at a lower medium tem-
perature of the coolant than before the transient process and a power corresponding
to the amount of heat removed from the steam generator. The change in the average
water temperature in loop 1 is determined by the ratio of the temperature and power
coefficients of reactivity. Figure 6.11 shows the curves of changes in the VVER-
365 parameters in the process of self-regulation when one turbine is disconnected.

During the self-regulation of VVER, the power of the reactor eventually falls in
line with the load of the turbo-generators. However, the process of the establish-
ment of the steady state continuing for a relatively long period of time is aperiod-
ic with large initial deviations of the parameters. Therefore, sufficiently simple
and reliable forced control systems are installed in VVER.

VVER power control is accomplished according to the programs shown schematically in
Figure 4.12.

The maintenance of a constant average coolant temperature in the core while the load
is decreasing is accompenied by a rise of steam pressure in the steam generators.
The positive aspects of the program of maintaining a constant average temperature of
circuit I are the maximum utilization of the self-regulation property of the reactor,
less rigid requirements for the volume compensation system of circuit I, and insig-
nificant changes in the amount of heat accumulated in circuit 1. The latter is par-
ticularly valuable for dependable operation of ABS in the mode of variable loads.

The negative aspect of the program of maintaining a constant average coolant temper-
ature is the necessity of manufacturing heavier steal generators designed for the

saturation pressure at the average temperature of circuit I, which is 15-20 kg-f/cm2
higher than the nominal pressure.

The advantage of the constant steam pressure program is the use of the least expen-
sive casings of steam generators, as well as easier temperature conditions of the
operation of circuit I at a lower power. However, this regulation program is char-
acterired by the greatest changes in the thermal potential of circuit I as the load
of the steam generator changes: when the load changes from 0 to 1001, the average
temperature of the coolant of circuit I increases by 20-30 degrees C.

The disadvantages of the programs for maintaining a constant average temperature of
the coolant in circuit I and a constant steam pressure in steam generators are par-
tially eliminated in the compromise regulation programs.

VVBR working in the basic load mode are regulated by using the regulation program
with maintenance of a constant steam pressure in the steam generators. tor example,

VVER-365 and VVBR-bko use a two-pulse reactor power control system with an analog

power control of the ARM (IRH) type [36]. Figure b.1l shows the curves of changes
in the VVBR-365 parameters when the load drops from 120 to 60 MM and the ARM regu-
lstor adjusts the perturbation. As can be seen from the curves, the ARM regulator

steadily and rapidly adjusted the power of the reactor to the load.

During the regulation of the reactor, it is permissible to change the load of the
unit at a rate of about 3-51 a minute. With respect to their regulation character-
istics, ABS are close to hydroelectric power stations and, in principle, can operate
in the mode of variable loads. However, when a reactor is controlled by changing
the concentration of boric acid, the rate of possible changes in the reactivity is
considerably lower than when it is regulated by mechanical elements of the 802. The
concentration of boric acid is changed by diluting the coolant of the reactor with
pure water or, on the contrary, by feeding a highly concentrated boric acid solution
into circuit I. Naturally, the time of the removal of boric acid from the coolant
of circuit I and, consequently, release of reactivity, is much longer than the time
of the withdrawal of $02 assemblies, which limits the possibility of changing the
reactor power in nonsteady-state transient xenon processes.

Let us estimate the rate of changes in the concentration of boric acid by solving
the differential equation of acid balance in circuit 1:

men Cnnqmvmﬂ—CWW- (lo-16>

where V -- volume of circuit 1 of the reactor without volume compensators, m3; Y --
water density at the average coolant temperature in circuit I of the reactor, kg/m3;
C -- concentration of boric acid in the water of circuit l,g/kg; c "on" -- concen-
tration of boric acid in the feed water of the reactor, g/kg; q o n" volumetric
flow rate of the feed water of the reactor, m3/h; y'nonn -- {1.5 water density,

Y’ up -4 blast water density, kg/m3; T -- operation length of the feed pumps, h.

As it follows from Figures 6.13 and 6.16, the withdrawal of boric acid fro. circuit
I occurs slowly, which, however, does not create any inconveniences in the operation
of the reactor at a steady-state power. when the power of the reactor changes,
there occur difficulties in raising its power which are connected with a rapid de-
crease in the reactivity excess due to the poisoning of the core by 13SXe (iodine
pit). In such cases, provision can be made for switching on the standby ionite fil-
ter cleansed of boric acid which greatly increases the rate of boric acid removal
[37]. Figure 4.15 shows the characteristics of the maneuverability of a unit with
VVBR-660 with consideration for the presence of the controlling group of $02 assen-
blies in the core for various relative rates of the decrease of boric acid concen-
tration. It can be seen from the curves that the maneuverability of the reactor
gets worse toward the end of the run.

The maneuverability of a reactor depends on the speed of bringing it to its full
power after a shutdown. For example, if a reactor is brought rapidly to its full
power, the accumulated xenon is burned out intensively by the neutron flux, and the
additional formation of X9 from iodine does not yet have any substantial effect on
the reactivity. This fact can be used for increasing the power of the station tem-
porarily, for example, to cover peak loads of the power system at the end of the
reactor run when the reactivity excess is small. By lowering the power during the
hours of low needs in energy, it is possible to accumulate a reactivity excess neces-
sary for maintaining the full power of the reactor during peak hours. At the NVABS,
this mode of operation at the end of the run was tested repeatedly on units II and
III. Calculation show that it is possible to select an optimal mode of power vari-
ations ensuring the fulfillment of the daily load schedule of a power system.

5.3. Permissible Power Level of Fuel Elements, Assemblies, and the Reactor

The main generally accepted initial prerequisites of determining the permissible
level of the thermal pover of a reactor are: a) impermissibility of the melting of
the fuel even in individual, the most energy-intensive fuel elements; b) necessity
of the absence of a heat exchange crisis on the surface of the fuel elements of the
most energy-intensive assemblies in the steady-state and any transient mode of oper-

ation of the reactor.

The conditions of the absence of fuel melting were analysed in work [3], where,

among other things, it was shown that, for the fuel elements of Mil-Moo, in which
slightly enriched uranium dioxide is used as fuel, the maximum linear load is ~ 500
w/cm. This load for the height distribution variation factor It, - 1.57 corresponds

to a maximum power of fuel elements of 0.08 IN.

Permissible Power of Fuel Elements. The maxi-m power of fuel elements with re-
spect to the heat-exchange crisis which is characterised by the appearance of cri-

tical phenomena even in one section of the fuel elements at prescribed physical and
geometrical characteristics of fuel elements is determined by the flow rate, temper-
ature, and pressure of the coolant. The condition of safe operation of a fuel ele-
ment can be ensured if the heat flow in the steady-state and emergency modes does
not exceed the critical flow over the entire height of the core. This condition de-
termines the permissible power of the fuel element with respect to the heat-exchange
crisis. Critical values of heat flows are calculated bg the empirical formula (5.9).
Finally, the permissible power of the fuel element N 1153" is established as the low-
est of the maximum powers with respect to the melting oyfuel and the heat-exchange
crisis with a definite factor of assurance k (arbitrary to a certain degree due to
insufficient understanding of the processes of heat removal in operating reactors).

Possible deviations of physical and geometrical characteristics of fuel elements are
allowed for by a special factor which is called mechanical 1:33;“ . With consid-
eration for these two coefficients, the permissible patter of fuel ele-

ments is equal to
~31: -- Nmklii‘k. (5.30)

where N 2.33% -- the lowest of the maxim powers of the fuel element with re-

spect to the melting of fuel and the heat-exchange crisis.

The factor of assurance 1: for VVER'MO is taken to be 1.1.

The main limitations on the permissible power of fuel elements in VVBR are imposed
in analyzing emergency situations connected with decreases in the flow rate of water
through the core (see section 5.5). In analyzing emergency conditions of this kind,
it is necessary to calculate the law of changes of the flow rate of the coolant in
the heated channel and the power of the fuel elements by using the formulas of sec-
tion 5.1 which correspond to the appearance of a heat-exchange crisis at the initial
and lowered values of the flow rate. Then the actual change in the energy release
in the fuel elements after the operation of the safety system caused by the lowering
of the flow rate of the coolant is calculated.

By comparing the curves of the changes in the flow rate of the coolant and the actual
energy release in the fuel elements (see Figures 5.7 and 5.8), the initial level of
power of the fuel elements is determined in the steady-state mode which makes it pos-
sible to prevent the heat-exchange crisis in the course of the entire transient pro-
cess.

The actual power of the fuel elements and its changes in the course of the run are
determined by calculations using, for example, programs BIPR-b [05] and "Benshedron"
[46]. Due to the absence of a system for measuring this power during the operation
of the reactor, the permissible rated power of fuel elements is decreased by the
accuracy of calculations, i.e.,

where k}3(1335,-- factor of assurance for a possible deviation of the actual value

It is determined by the accuracy of the accepted calculation methods and programs,
specifically, for the programs BIPR-lo and "Hexahedron" I: 30.33,,- 1.14.

In VVER, the condition of the absence of the melting fuel is fulfilled in the major-
ity of cases of operational modes and, therefore, the maximum power of the fuel ele-
ments is determined practically only by the danger of critical phenomena of heat re-
moval.

Permissible Power of Fuel Assemblies. Knowing the permissible power of fuel elements,
it is possible to determine the permissible power of fuel assemblies (clusters). It
is determined by the condition of the absence of the heat-exchange crisis even on

the most energy-intense fuel element.

For the convenience of the valuation of the critical power of the assemblies, the
concept of critical power “k of an assembly with mean physical and geometrical
characteristics and equally intense fuel elements is introduced. Critical power is
calculated with semiempirical formulas obtained by processing experimental data in
bundles of heat-producing rods (see, for example, work [47]). Specifically, the
critical power of a VVER-hbo assembly at constant heat production along the height
is determined by formulae

respectively, keel/kg; x -- mass steam content at the outlet from the assembly; 0.;
-- water flow rate through the assembly, t/h. The water flow rate throughthe as-
sembly can be determined if we know its hydraulic characteristics (see section 5.2).

The maximum permissible power of an assembly when there is no boiling of the water
(xaux I 0) is found by the formula .

:"“°“ - (t' —i..)Q./860 m. (5.33)

In real assemblies, power is distributed nonuniformly among the fuel elements.

This nonuniformity is characterised by the coefficient kk which is equal to the ra-
tio of the maximum power of the fuel element of the assembly to the mean power.

This coefficient depends on the enrichment of the fuel, the position of the assembly
in the core, the position of the regulating elements. and the concentration of the
liquid absorber of neutrons (boric acid) in the coolant. The value of It]; is deter-
mined through calculations (see section 7.3).

With consideration for the mechanical coefficient k: x and the factor of assur-
ance k, the expression for the permissible power of tﬁxe assembly will assume the

following form:

determine the critical and permissible rated conditions of work of the maximally
intense assemblies.

In the process of operation, the thermal power of the fuel assemblies is monitored
by measuring the temperature of the coolant at the outlet from individual assemblies
and average temperature at the inlet to the core. The permissible measured power of
the assemblies is corrected with consideration for measurement errors.

The above evaluations are done in the following manner. The relative power of the

It can be seen from these data that the error for the maximum values of K3 occurring
during the operation of reactors (1.25-1.35) is Av 10%.

Permissible Power of a Reactor. The permissible power of a reactor is determined by
the absence of critical phenomena even on the most intense fuel element of the most
intense assembly of the core in a steady-state mode and in modes when the flow rate
of water in circuit I decreases with simultaneous activation of the safety system.
It is evident that the permissible power of a reactor can be increased if the non-
uniformity of energy release is reduced. Nonuniformity of energy release in any as-
sembly of the core is characterized by the calculated coefficient kq,1, where i is
the number of the assembly in the core. The maximum value of the coefficient

kbiak:ﬂm characterizes energy release in the most intense assembly.

The coefficient of the nonuniformity of energy release of the most energy-intense
fuel elements Huaxc can be represented in the form

kmm“(ks.(ka)"“k:u- (5.39)

Since the coefficient kk is not monitored during the operation of a reactor, this

representation of kllauc is not very convenient. Therefore it is usually assumed
that

km = krmkiu. (5.50)
where k: -- calculated value of kk for an assembly wit}: the maximum product (km‘k:)uaua

Thus. the critical power and the maximum permissible power of the reactor will be
defined as

~;’ - ~:'n.Jk...w ' ‘5‘“)
N:"“"" =— N?‘“‘"'Ii.Jk....- (5.42)

where “k -« the number of fuel assemblies in the core of the reactor.
The permissible power of the reactor must be reduced by a factor of assurance k.

Moreover, in order to ensure safe operation of the reactor, in addition to ”@3le ),
the following additional factors of assurance are introduced: k3(n)-- allowing for
deviations in the real power of the reactor from the design power; k3(Tp) -- allow-
ing for the deviations of the power of the reactor from the prescribed level due to
variations in the loads of the turbogenerators; k 8(BX) -- allowing for the de-

gree of nonmixing of the water at the inlet to the core and the resulting macronon-
uniformity of the temperature field at the inlet to the core of the reactor.

FOR OFFICIAL USP 0V! \

For VVER-MO, the above factors are taken to be:."dN)="m; Ian-0:133; k""’-"0|+|‘03
(the higher value is taken when the thermal power of the reactor is less than 501
of the rated power).

With consideration of all correction coefficients, the permissible rated power of
the reactor is

N’J'T'“? = N?".J’¢...J¢um (5.43)

where km=kmmﬁawﬁanrﬁnmﬂ -- the aggregate factor of assurance. For VVER-MO,
k a - 1.36. The total correction coefficient in determining the permissible power
of we reactor with consideration for the mechanical coefficient k“ox - 1.1, is 1.5.

It should be mentioned that the permissible power of the reactor also depends on the
temperature (enthalpy) of the coolant at the inlet to the core. In calculating the
critical thermal flow by formula (5.9), a proportionally greater channel power cor-
responds to the same critical flow (to the same output steam content) when the inlet
temperature (enthalpy) drops. The change in the permissible power of the reactor
when the inlet temperature (enthalpy) changes is determined by the relation*

the reactor, kg/h; [ii -- change of the coolant enthalpy at the inlet to the core,
keel/kg; 1) -- coefficient allowing for the change in the flow rate of the coolant
in transient modes. The coefficient q> is selected as a ratio of the coolant flow
rate during transient modes corresponding to the moment of the maximum reactor power-
flow rate ratio,to the initial coolant flow rate. For VVER-éko with a regular GTsN
[main circulation pump] feed circuit, the worst transient (emergency) mode is the
loss of the productivity of two GTsN without a change in the power (see section 5.7).
In this case, (p 2’. 0.7.

The increase of the permissible power of the reactor during the lowering of the in-
let temperature (enthalpy) of the coolant is limited by the critical heat flow at a
zero steam content at the outlet from the channel with the highest thermal stress.
This flow must not be exceeded in any section of the heated channel (which, apart
from the power of the channel, is determined by the distribution of energy release
along the channel). Moreover, the lowering of the inlet enthalpy is limited by the
undesirable lowering of the parameters of the second (steam-turbine) circuit, poten-
tialities of the heat exchangers (steam generators), and the growth of thermal
stresses in the reactor vessel.

The values of the above-mentioned factors of assurance are taken and introduced ar-
bitrarily in many respects due to insufficiently accurate measurements or calcula-

tions of the core parameters. Making them more accurate is a potential reserve for
increasing the power of VVER which can be realized after conducting the necessary

complex of studies and implementation of a number of technical measures.

7.1. Arrangement of Fuel Assemblies in the Core

The operating economy of an AES [atomic electric power station] is determined to a
considerable degree by the effectiveness of the utilization of nuclear fuel which is
characterized by the attained burnup fraction. It follows from the theoretical anal-
ysis conducted in the work [50] that the burnup fraction for a prescribed level of
energy production depends on the mode of fuel reloading. The evaluation of the ef-
fectiveness of various reloading modes is done by introducing the concept of an

ideal mode in which the depleated fuel is constantly replaced by fresh fuel with
constant mixing in the volume of the core so that the burnup fraction would be iden-
tical for all assemblies being unloaded.

The VVBR design makes it impossible to accomplish the ideal reloading mode, however,
by comparing the selected real mode with the ideal mode, it is possible to evaluate
its effectiveness and the degree to which it approaches the ideal mode.

Ideal Reloading Hone. The burnup fraction of the reloaded fuel in the ideal mode
can be determined by introducing the concept of the mean factor of neutron multipli-

cation in a core of infinite dimensions:

Periodic Reloading node. The VVER design calls for periodic fuel reloading on a
stopped reactor. It is evident that in order to increase the burnup fraction it is
desirable to reload the reactor more often, approaching the ideal mode. 0n the
other hand, frequent shutdowns of the reactor lower the production of electric en-
ergy and, therefore, are undesirable. Moreover, even with continuous reloading and
radial mixing of the fuel during the power operation of the reactor, the ideal burn-

up fraction cannot be attained due to the nonuniformit of energy release along the
height of the core, which follows from the formula [50 :

When k; - 1.20 -§- 1.30, which can take place in a real burnup situation, the dis-

of the fuel assemblies with continuous rearrangement in the core (the fuel is not

mixed along the height) the burnup fraction is approximately 20% smaller than in the
ideal mode.

Under real operating conditions, the following periodic reloading modes can be accom-
plished.

Mode A. During each reloading, l/n part of the core assemblies is replaced. In the
course of the entire operation time of the assemblies T (total operating period of
the fuel), n partial reloadingsare done. The assemblies in the core are not rear-

ranged during the reloadings. The disadvantage factor for this mode is estimated by
the formula

where 9 -- nonuniformity function of energy release over the volume of the core.
The value of 9 in the general case is determined by numerical methods. In the

extreme case, when the radius of the core is very large, or when the fuel assemblies
are continually rearranged, the value of 9 coincides with the value of he determined
by formula (7.7). In another extreme case, when the reactivity excess compensatin

the burnup is very small, 9 has a maximum value equal to 2.25, i.e., k:“'3=&25(l+4 eff

The maximum value of the disadvantage factor (at n - l) is 4.5.

Mode 8. Part of the assemblies are rearranged during fuel reloading for equalizing
the breeding properties of the core over the radius. During the total operating
time of the fuel T, in each of the n reloadings of the core consisting of N assem-
blies, N/n of the most burned-out assemblies staying in the reactor during the T
time are unloaded. The same number of “In fresh assemblies are loaded in the core.

The above mode is accomplished only at n 2>3.

Mode C. The fuel assemblies in the core are not rearranged. Periodic reloading of
the assemblies is done in proportion to the radial component of the energy-release
field. The core consisting of N assemblies is divided into m circular subsones.
Each circular subzone is divided into sections containing l1 assemblies each (1 ~-
number of the subsone, 1 :5 i :5 m); the number of assemblies in each section of
the subaone is the same, and the number of these sections is proportional to the num-
ber of reloadings bra given subsone. The portion of the assemblies being reloaded
in each zone 1/ L1 is proportional to the radial component of the energy-release
field in the subsone. Then, the number of the assemblies being reloaded, for exam-
ple in the first subsone can be found if the number of assemblies reloaded in the
i-th subsone is known;

radius of the core.

Under real conditions, mode B is used most widely because it makes it possible to
improve the distribution of energy release over the core and thus to reduce the dis-
advantage factor kc and to increase the fuel burnup fraction.

Selection of Fuel Loading Under Real Operating Conditions. When selecting the fuel
reloading mode under real conditions, it is necessary to consider the technical po-
tentialities of the VVER. As a rule, the reloading of a reactor is done simultane-
ously with routine maintenance of the equipment of the ABS unit which takes approxi-
mately one month. The necessity of prolonged shutdown of a reactor for reloading
lowers the utilization factor of its installed capacity, therefore, the number of
shutdowns for reloading must be minimal. The needs of the power system which exclude
possible shutdowns of ABS units for reloading during the fall and winter energy load
maximums should be considered as an additional condition. The mode of operation of
ABS units with one shutdown of the reactor a year for reloading during the spring
floods when energy needs are satisfied by hydroelectric power stations is the most
favorable for the energy system.

On the other hand, the reloading mode must ensure a sufficient burnup fraction
which increases as the number of the reactor reloadings during a full fuel operating
period increases.

With consideration for these conditions, the mode of three partial fuel reloadings
during the run was accepted for VVER, which ensures the operation of the unit be-
tween reloadings in the course of one year (see section 12.2). In this case, as a
rule, the number of the assemblies reloaded during each reloading time is close to
one third of all the core assemblies, but it can also deviate from this number in
individual units depending on the planned tasks of the ABS as a whole.

In the first reactors -- VVER-Zlo (unit I of the NVABS) and VVER-70 (ABS "Reinsberg",
COR) -- the loaded assemblies were distributed evenly in the core [3, 51]. In the
new reactors -- VVBR-béo and vvsa-looo which are equipped with boron control systems
-- a zonal arrangement of the core is adopted, when the energy-release field is ad-
ditionally leveled along the radius.

The special characteristics of the zonal method of fuel arrangement are as follows:
1) fresh fuel is arranged only at the core periphery; 2) the burned out fuel is in
the central part of the core.

The fuel reloading mode with zonal arrangement is accomplished in the following man-
ner: a) highly burned out fuel which remained in the reactor for three periods is
removed from the central part of the core (approximately one third of all the assen-
blies); b) assemblies from the periphery and the its adjacent area which remained
in the reactor for one or two periods are moved to the central part of the core; c)
fresh fuel is loaded in the peripheral part of the core.

FOR<0FFKJAI.USE(NVLV
FOR OFFICIAL USU-Z "NIX

The zonal arrangement of the core makes it possible to achieve a considerable burnup
fraction which is duc to the lowering of the nonuniformity of radial energy release.

The loading of the fuel is determined by calculation according to special pragrams
on a computer, the following requirements being fulfilled: 1) eneurance of the neces-
sary length of reactor operation until the next reloading; 2) ensurance of the opera-
tion of the core at the rated power with minimum possible values of the nonuniform-

ity factors over the radius and volume of the core; 3) ensurance of the necessary
subcriticslity of the stopped reactor in the cold atate.

In wan-Mo reactors st WARS, Kol'skaya ABS, and other ABS, fuel of two composi-
tions -- 2.10 and 3.6% enrichment .. are used in the steady-state fuel makeup mode.

Cartograms of the first fuel loading of was-moo of the V unit at MASS are shown
in Figures 2.10 and 2.11. In the mode of a three-year fuel cycle, the core is made
up with a fuel with an initial enrichment of 4.61, and in the mode of a two-year
cycle -- with an initial enricbent of 3.32.

As a rule, the selection of the first loadings of a ma are checked and sometimes
refined by physical experiments on critical assemblies in the Institute of Nuclear
Energy imeni I. V. lurchatov [210, 50, 52]. Such experiments make it possible to
correct the calculation program used in selecting subsequent loadings of reactor
cores. The necessary experiments are also conducted during the startup and opera-
tion of MR.

Physical experiments make it possible to determine: 1) critical positions of groups
of $02 assemblies and their effectiveness; 2) boric acid effectiveness, which is
particularly important for WEE-MO in which the necessary subcriticality of the
core is not ensured without boric acid in the coolant of circuit 1; 3) temperature
and power coefficients of reactivity, which is necessary for evaluating the self-
rcguiztion of reactors; 5) power distribution over the core assemblies; 5) 135Xe
and 93m transient processes.

The loading of the core of W is symetric over the azimuth with an order of sym-
metry of not less than 3 (sector of symnetry with a 120° angle in the plane). This
makes it possible to calculate only one third part of the core when selecting the
next loading of the reactor. however, in practice, it is possible to have cases
when during the reloading of the fuel from the reactor, it is necessary for various

63

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

reasons to unload from some sector of symetry one or several assemblies which are
not subject to replacement. In this case, the symtry of the loading cartogram

is disturbed, because the enpty cell is loaded with a fresh assembly of the sane
(or, perhaps, different) enrichment, or a burned-out assembly, but with a different
slag content. In such cases, it is necessary to calculate the burnup of the entire
core (360° in the plane), or be content with averaging the properties of the assen-
blies which are syllaetric with respect to their asimuthal position, but are not iden-
tical with respect to their neutron-physics characteristics. the asymmetry in slag
content can appear also in a symtrically loaded core, ifin the course of the burnup
process the sy-netrically arranged mechanical controls of the 802 have different de-
grees of insertion into the reactor.

In conclusion, let us mention that at WARS, where reactors with various specific
powers are operating, it is possible, in principle, to increase the attainable burn-
up fraction by burning assemblies which are not completely depleted in a higher
power reactor in a reactor of a lower power [53]. This is possible because the nul-
tiplication constant of a burned-out assembly is increased when it is placed in a
reactor of a lower power resulting from a partial release of the power and tempera-
ture effects of reactivity and a decrease in the effect of xenon poisoning. Since
an assenbly reaches its maximal possible burnup fraction in a low power reactor, it
is possible to unload a certain amount of not coupletely burned out assemblies from
a high-power reactor. In other words, it is possible to reload more than one third
assemblies in a high-power reactor and thus to increase the operation tine between
reloadings. The economical advantanges of this combined use of fuel are discussed
in more detail in section 12.6.

7.2. Calculation of the Neutron Physics Characteristics of a Reactor

As was mentioned before, the selection of fuel loading is done with the aid of spe-
cial calculation programs. The following basic programs are used in designing VVIR
and in predicting their characteristics in the process of operation*:

1) UNIRASOS (or ROR) ~- e four-group program for calculating neutron-physics proper-
ties of low-enrichment uranium-water fuel lattices and changes in these properties
as the nuclear fuel burns out [210, 54];

2) BIPR -- a sin le-group diffusion program for calculating a three-dimensional re-
actor as a whole fas];

3) RAGU -- a one-dimensional four-group diffusion program for calculating the neu-
tron flux density on the external boundary of the core with a reflector and on the
surfaces of the absorbers of the 802 assemblies;

6) RR -- a single-group program using the perturbation theory for calculating the
reactivity factors of a reactor, the lifetime of prompt neutrons, the effective frac-
tion of delayed neutrons, and the time constant of delayed neutrons (this program
works only in conjunction with the BIPR program) [25];

S) THEL -- a program for calculating the temperature field and the margin until the
melting of the fuel and pressure of gaseous fission products in the fuel elements of
VVER reactors [SS];

6) GD!" -- a program for calculating the hydrodynamic characteristics of fuel assem-
blies;'

7) RASKhOD -- a program for analysing emergency situations of the reactor in the
case of a partial lowering of the coolant flow;

8) P-OOZ -- a program for solving the kinetic equations of the reactor with consider-
ation for automatic control.

 

*The programs mentioned here were prepared by the following members of the Institute
of Atomic Energy imeni I. V. Kurchstov: A. N. Novikov, V. D. Sidorenko, D. H. Petru-

Other programs for some concrete problems of WBR operation are also being used.

The following programs are used for calculating the distribution of energy release
fields within assemblies (for more detail see section 7.3):

1) ShBSTIcRANNIK [Hexahedron] (or its variant -- rasucoi'mx [triangleb -- a tuo-
group diffusion program for calculating the distribution of energy release in indivi-

dual fuel elements of hexahedral assemblies [46];

2) HIKRO -- a program for a simplified evaluation of specific thermal loads of in-
dividual fuel elements in an assembly (by the results of calculations using BIPR and

ShSTIGRANNIK programs) .

Simultaneous combined use of several programs made it possible to develop a method
for physical calculation of the core and a method of thernohydraulic and dynamic cal-
culations of reactors.

Let us examine the ideology of some of the above-mentioned programs used in the se-
lection of cartograms of core loading of VVBR.

UNIRASOS (ROR) Program. The four-group program ROR is used widely in designing WBR
and in calculating regular fuel reloadings. This program makes it possible to deter-
mine the neutron-physics properties and the burnup of homogeneous low-enrichment fuel
lattices of VVER [54]. The ROR program makes it possible to calculate lattices with
local nonuniformities, when a small part of fuel rods is replaced with abosrbing ele-
ments (PEL), or when boron is contained in the jackets of the assemblies. It is pos-
sible to estimte indirectly the effect of the boric acid dissolved in the coolant

of the first circuit. At the present time, this program is supplemented by a con-
siderably improved progra -- MRASOS.

The UNIRASOS (universal calculation of states) program makes it possible to calculate
with the aid of computer small-group constants and their changes in the process of
fuel burnup for a uniform fuel lattice (the presence of s small number of PEI. is per-
mitted) composed of identical assemblies, cells, or fuel elements, i.e., for a homo-
genized lattice of a given composition and geometry. This program makes it possible
to calculate a series of individual states of the lattice, obtain and store (on a
magnetic tape or on punched cards) the dependence of the neutron-physics constants

of the lattice on the temperature of the coolant and the fuel, density of the moder-
ator, power, and other parameters. The moderator can be in the form of a mixture of
H20 and 020 and can contain a boric acid solution. The fuel is a mixture of isotopes
from 2311’s to 2(“*Cm of any composition which may also contain nonfissionable els- .
ments. The covering material of the fuel elements and PBL, assembly jackets, and
PEI. rods may contain, besides 105, 16 other burnable isotopes, including those with
strong isolated resonances.

The UNIRASOS program, just as ROR, is based on splitting the neutrons spectrum into
four groups (see section 2.3). With an appropriate approach, the three upper groups
are combined into one group of epithet-ml neutrons. The first groups contains prac-'
tically the entire fission spectrum. A noticeable portion of fission occurs on
2330. - The lover boundary of the group corresponds to the vanishing of the cross
section of 738i! fission. The neutron spectrum within the second group is close to

66

the Fermi spectrum, and the resonance cnpture is weak. Resonances of the heavy
isotopes are concentrated almost entirely in the third group: 232th, 2330, 2350,2381],
239m, 24°Pu, 2M-i’u,2“2Pu. In the fourth (thermal) group, a large portion of the
fission takes place. In describing the processes in this group, the thermal motion
of the nuclei of the medium is taken into consideration (approaching of a heavy gas-
eous moderator).

Within the above energy groups, effective group constants are practically constant
for all reasonable variants of the properties of the medium. In a homogenised medium
of a prescribed composition, the group constants are expressed in terms of effective
microscopic cross sections calculated in the Pl-approximation. The homogenizing of
the equivalent cell is done for each of the four groups.

The distinctive characteristic of WER is the distribution of the fuel of a given
degree of enrichment over the assemblies whose dimensions are sufficiently great in
comparison with the characteristic path lengths of neutrons. Even in the hot state,
the diffision length of thermal neutron is such (I. 5‘5 3 cm) that the dimentions of
the assemblies are 4-5 L. Moreover, the dimensions of the assemblies are much
greater than the moderation length. Therefore, each assembly can be considered to

be isolated both with respect to thermal neutrons, and with respect to epithermal
neutrons. when the enrichment is small, the spectrum of epitherml neutrons depends
weakly on the enrichment, and it is taken to be identical in all assemblies. In all
variants of the geometry of the lattice composition occurring in practice, the migra-
tion area H2 even in the hot state is of the order of 60-80 cm2, i.e., H a 8 {- 9
cm. Since the dimensions of the assemblies are 2-3 H, it is sufficient to limit one-
self to the Pl-approximation for determining the angular dependence of the neutron
flux density.

with all of the above-mentioned characteristics of the fuel lattice, it is possible
to consider that in the greater part of the assembly an approximation holds true at
which the spatial distribution of the neutron flux density is identical for all en-
ergy groups. The length of the fuel elements of VVER is many times greater than
their diameter, therefore, the conditions of the diffusion of neutrons along the as:-
is of the rods and at right angles to them are different. The following system of
equations is solved in the UNIRASOS program with consideration for the neutron dif-
fusion anisotropy:

X1 -- share of fission neutrons per given group; It at, -- effective multiplication

By solving this system at prescribed values of B; and 3:, it is possible to deter-

mine k3¢ and vice versa, if we take k:,p - 1, it is possible to determine the size-
shape factor in the critical state. The system of equations (7.16) makes it possible
to determine the neutron-physics characteristics of the fuel lattice also in a single-
group and a two-group approximations. The determination of the heterogeneous effects
is accomplished during the homogenizing of the equivalent cell.

The UNIRASOS program has a number of innovations in comparison with the ROR program
which make it possible to take into account a number of effects more accurately and
expand the potentialities of the program.

A list of fission products which are taken into consideration is given below in the
order adopted in the standard variant of the UNIRASOS program:

In the BIPR program, the reactor core is represented in the plan by several symmetric
sectors in each of which the arrangement of assemblies with identical calculated
neutron-physics properties and the same design number n repeats syumutrically (1&5

n £3 117 for three symmetry sectors for VVBR-ébO).

This program makes it possible to calculate symmetry sectors with angles of 30, 60,
120 and 360 degrees. Due to the presence of symmetry, calculations are done for
only one sector, which substantially simplifies and speeds up the calculation of the
loading cartograms. Moreover, the "joining" conditions of the neutron flux densities
on the inner boundaries of the symmetry sector are observed closely, i.e., the re-
sults of calculations are true for the entire core.

For mathematical description of physical processes, the real core in which the assem-
blies are arranged in plan over a triangular lattice is represented by a mathemati-
cal model, where continuous changes in the properties in the core volume are replaced
by discrete changes over the points in which all physical properties averaged over
the cross section of the assemblies are concentrated. Along the height of the assem-
blies, m cross sections (points, 1:5 In sEIO) are taken and, thus, the core is re- ‘
presented in the form of a spatial lattice. At each lattice point with coordinates
(n, m), a number of characteristics changing in time during the burnup are determined,
breeding properties (kao ) depending on the kind of fuel, local power effects, ef-
fects of poisoning by samarium and xenon, fuel burnup depth, neutron flux density
field, energy release field, etc.

The working assemblies are represented as a stationary spatial lattice of points,

the real lattice of $02 assemblies is represented as a mobile spatial lattice of
points. The movement of control elements is taken to be discrete with the movement
pitch (3 hsuz equal to the distance between the points along the height. In the
process of the calculation of one SLSCG, the points of the mobile and stationary lat-
tices always coincide. Unlike the points of the stationary lattice, the points of
the mobile lattice can have either the properties of absorbers, or of the fuel, de-
pending on the degree of the withdrawal of the $02 assembly from the core.

The simulation of the process of power control by a liquid absorber is also accepted
to be discrete ( (leg).

The initial prerequisites of the BIPR program are as follows.

1. The distribution of the neutron flux density over an inhomogeneous core is found
from the solution of the following one-group equation:

AW) -l- x*(r. mm) = o. _ (7.17)

(Transition to discrctcness is accomplished by replacing the radius vector r of the
lattice point under consideration by its coordinates n, m). This equation can be
reduced to the Poisson equation or to the diffusion equation (depending on the state-
ment of the problem). It is solved by the iteration method according to the finite-
difference scheme in a nine-point spatial lattice around each point.

Boundary conditions are given on the external boundaries of the core and on the sur-
faces of the SUZ assemblies:

Appendix. Example of the Calculation of Loading (Reloading) of Fuel in the VVER-bbo
Reactor

The neutron energy spectrum averaged over the cross section of the assembly is found
to be close to the asymptotic spectrum and is determined, primarily, by the proper-
ties of the assembly itself, which makes it possible to separate the problem of the
calculation of small-group cross sections of fuel lattices and changes in the iso-
topic composition during the burnup of fuel from the calculation of the reactor as

a whole. Thus, the final results of calculations by the UNIRASOS (ROR) program are
the input parameters for the BIPR program.

Let us illustrate the selection of the cartogram of the loading (reloading) of nucle-
ar fuel on an example of the calculation of the first loading of the VVBR-ébo of the
IV unit of NVABS.

The three-dimensional calculation of the reactor is performed in the following se-
quence:

1. Calculation of the neutron-physics characteristics of the fuel assemblies to be
used in loading, -- by the UNIRASOS (use) program.

2. Calculation of the reciprocal values of the logarithmic derivatives of the neu-
tron flux density on the boundary of the core with a reflector and on the boundary
of the absorbers of the 802 with fuel -- by the RAG" program.

3. Calculation of the subcriticality (supercriticality) of the core in the cold
state -- by the BIPR program.

b. Calculation of the distributions of the densities of neutron fluxes and energy
releases, as well as of the fuel burnup over the volume of the core -- by the BIPR
program. '

5. Calculation of the effectiveness of the control elements -- by the BIPR program.

6. Calculation of the coefficients of the reactivity of the reactor -- by the RR
and BIPR programs.

Let us examine the process of calculations step by step.

1. Fuel assemblies of three degrees of enrichment were used in the reactor: 1.6,
2.6, and 3.67. (see Table 7.2). Consequently, it is necessary to perform three com-
plete calculations of the burnup of such fuel lattices, as well as several short
calculations of individual state for each fuel lattice (see Section 2.3) for vari-
ous values of specific power, temperature of the coolant-moderator, and the boron
concentration in it.

Calculations were done by the Ron program. The input parameter for this program are

cards and are introduced into the computer. After completing machine computations,
extensive output information is printed. The results of computations are shown
graphically in Figures 2.5-2 9.

The next step is the processing of the obtained results in a form convenient for the
BIPR prgram. For this purposeI the dependence of the multiplication constant of the
fuel lattice of grade B on various effects of reactivity [see formula (7.22)] is ap-
proximated as follows:

one time for each reactor. Results for the cold and hot states of VVER are given
on page 61, as well as below.

3. Tor the three-dimensional calculation of fuel burnup in the core: the symmetry
sector of 120 degrees containing 117 assemblies. Preparations for computations
according to the BIPR program begin with the selection of an arrangement scheme of
assemblies in the core with variOus initial fuel enrichment levels and various de-
grees of burnup fractions. The initial prerequisites and the ideology of combining
fuel assemblies are discussed in section 7.1. For this case, the loading cartograma
are shown in Figure 7.2, its composition is given in Table 7.2.

It is also necessary to give the values of 14%, 149511 and slag concentrations in
all 1170 points of the syusnetry sector of the core. If the burnup of a fresh un-
poisoned core is calculated, these values are equal to zero. The initial parameters
are introduced into the computer and fuel burnup in a three-dimensional core is cal~
culated. The following information is printed out at definite time intervals: dis-
tribution of slags, relative energy release and neutron flux densities over the en-
tire volume of the core being calculated, as well as the average distribution of
slags, energy releases and heating over the assemblies in the form of cartogrsms for
the synnetry sector. For a typical case, some results of calculations are shown
graphically in Figure 10.1. The diagrams reflect the peculiarities of conducting
the burnup mode: first, with the aid of boric acid in the coolant with a fixed posi-
tion of the controls of the working group, and then after the withdrawal of boron
from the reactor, with the aid of $02 assemblies.

The following are some characteristics of the burnup mode printed by the computer
before the end of the boron regulation mode: '1' a 2100 effective days; in“ (over the
core) - 8.156 kg slag/t U; k - 0.99976 kW - 1.667 at a point n,n - 61.3; Innax
al.259 in an assembly of n - 2?, c3 - 0.05 g V.kg 320.

On completion of computations, the c uter printed complete information for the
core and punched networks for slags, 1 98m and 1"9Pm. Having supplemented the ini-
tial data with some constants, it is possible to calculate 1 5Xe transient processes
when the power rises or lowers.

If the computed characteristics of the burnup in the course of the operating period
are unsatisfactory, the entire procedure is repeated, beginning with the change in
the loading cartogram.

6. Due to the fact that the temperature effect of WEI! reactivity is negative (see
section 3.2), the cold state of the reactor is the most dangerous from the point of
nuclear safety. fl'he determination of the subcriticality (supercriticality) in the

cold state is particularly important for VVBR-éko in which the total reactivity ex-
cess of the loaded (reloaded) core (see section 3.3) is sufficiently great and does
not make it possible to operate it without boric acid in the coolant. Subcritical-
ity (supercriticality) of the selected load is calculated by the BIPR program as a
computation of one state of the reactor with initial data corresponding to the cold
state.

The following results were obtained for the case in question for the cold state:
keff - 1.2161 -- all upper SUZ assemblies, c3 - 0; keff - 1.032lh -- all lower 302
assemblies, cg - 0; keff - 10000-- all lower SUZ assemblies, c3 - 0.174 g V/kg E20;
keff - l0000-- all upper SUZ assemblies, c3 - 1.347 g V/kg H20; keff - 0.9221 --
all upper SUZ assemblies, cg - 2.1 g Vlkg H20; keff - 0.8129 -- all lower 802 as-
semblies. cg - 2.1 g V/kg H20. .

The last value of keff characterizes the allowed stopped condition of the reactor
in the cold state.

S. It is important to know the differential and integral effectiveness of the con-
trols (see section 3.3) for the evaluation of the capacity of the 802 system (as a
whole or for individual groups of assemblies) to compensate successfully various re-
activity effects under any operating conditions, both steady-state, and nonsteady-
state (transient and emergency).

The effectiveness of controls depends on the composition and the combination method
of fuel assemblies in the core. Therefore, for a new reloaded (and in a number of
cases for a reloaded) core, it is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the
controls for various states of the reactor. Calculations are done by the BIPR pro-
gram in a special mode of its operation. The results of the calculations are shown
in Tables 3.5, 3.6 and in Figures 3.7, 3.8.

6. Computations of reactivity coefficients of the core (see section 3.2) character-
ising the dynamics of changes in reactivity in nonsteady-states of the reactor are
connected very directly with everything that was said above.

The necessary initial data prepared by the UNIRASOS (ROE) program together with the
RR program are introduced into the computer for computations using the BIPR program.
Thus, the determination of the coefficients of reactivity is combined with computa-
tions of individual states of the reactor or fuel burnup. Information on both pro-
grams is presented simultaneously, which is very convenient.

The results of the computations of coefficients of reactivity for various modes of
VVBR are shown in Tables 3.1, 3.2. and in Figures 3.3-3-6.

7. The selection of the cartogram of core loading is concluded by a thermohydraulic
analysis of permissible operation modes of the reactor with this load for creating
safe conditions for the fuel elements eliminating the melting of the fuel and the
occurrence of a heat exchange crisis under any nonsteady-state conditions (see Chap-
ter 5). This is a very important stage of calculations which can introduce definite
corrections in the operating mode of the reactor.

The principles of the thermohydraulic analysis are explained in section 5.3. The
initial materials are: results of calculation of the fuel load burnup by the BIPR
program (see Figure 4.1), hydrodynamic characteristics of the assemblies and the
reactor obtained by the GDKh program (see Figures 5.1, 5.2), charts for emergency
reduction of the coolant flow rate when several GTsN are turned off (see section 5.5,
Figure 5.10), coefficients of micrononuniformity of energy release for the fuel ele-
ments within the assemblies calculated by the programs ShESTIGRANNIK and MIKRO (see
section 7.3, Figures 7.4-7.7, Tables 7.6, 7.5), and the method for calculating the
margin to the melting of the fuel using the Ml. program.

The maximally energy-intensive fuel element is found in the core, and it is assumed
that it limits the power level of the reactor. The maximum permissible power of the
fuel element, the assembly, and the reactor are determined in successive order. As
a result of these computations, a chart is obtained for the maximum permissible power
of the reactor in the course of the run and a table of permissible power levels of
the reactor depending on the number of operating 61‘s“ and power supply circuits of
GTsN (see Table 5.7) are obtained.

8.14. Studying Spent Nuclear Fuel in a Hot Chamber

The condition of fuel elements which reached the necessary burnup level and were un-
loaded from the reactor are studied in detail in a hot chamber. In the process of
studies, the condition of spent fuel elements and other parts of the assembly is
evaluated, defective fuel elements and causes of the appearance of the defects are
revealed, possibilities of achieving an above-plan burnup level are evaluated, and
ways of improving the assemblies are determined. Moreover, gam-spectrometrics
studies of spent fuel elements make it possible to determine experimentally the ab-
solute value of fuel burnup and burnup distribution over the cross section and height
of the assemblies and to obtain information about the migration of fission fragments,
which makes it possible to evaluate indirectly the operating temperature of the fuel
in the fuel elements.

WER fuel elements work with high temperature differences between the central part
of the fuel elements and the jacket, creating thermal stresses. Neutron fluences
affecting fuel elements reach values of the order of 1021 neutrons/cmz. Under these
conditions of fuel element operation, the fuel swells, gaseous fission fragments
accumulate under the jacket, and the strength properties of the fuel element jackets
change.

Experimental studies of spent assemblies in a hot chamber made it possible to con-
clude that the design of the WEB assemblies and fuel elements and the technology of
their manufacturing ensure a sufficient working capacity of the fuel to the rated
burnup level and higher.

"hen studying spent assemblies in a hot chamber, they are first examined visually
in order to reveal possible defects and to evaluate the nature of the deposits of
corrosion products. The equipment of the hot chamber makes it possible to measure
the diameter and length of the fuel element, pressure of gaseous fission products
under the jacket, ultimate strength, and relative lengthening of the fuel element
jackets and to determine the chemical composition of the detected deposits.

For an example. Table 8.6 gives the experimental data about the changes in the dia-
meter and length of the fuel elements of WER-365 assemblies of the unit II of NVABS
[67]. Changes in the fuel element diameter are within the limits of the manufactur-
ing tolerance, i.e., there is actually no transverse swelling of the jackets. The
increase in the fuel element length is somewhat higher than the manufacturing toler-
ance. The design of the assemblies makes it possible to compensate the temperature
elongation of the fuel elements, and the absence of their bending indicates a normal
compensation of such elongations.

The pressure of gaseous fission fragments under the fuel element jacket is determined
by puncturing the jacket. In the VVER-36S assemblies which were studied, the gas
pressure under the fuel element jackets under operating conditions is about 10 kg-
force/cmz. This value of the pressure under the jacket indicates that the tempera-
ture of the fuel pellets during the operation of the fuel elements does not exceed

1600 degrees C [68].

Special attention is given to the study of fuel elements with detected defects in
the jackets.

The following are the possible causes of damages of fuel element jackets: 1) local
overheating; 2) cracking connected with stresses or fatigue, as well as with the ef-
fect of thermal cycles of the core and jacket of the fuel element during rapid and
considerable changes in the power of the assemblies and the reactor as a whole; 3)
swelling or excessive elongation of the fuel elements caused by the accumulation of
gaseous fission products or structural changes in the fuel pellets; 4) development
of microdefects in the jackets of fuel elements which were not detected in the pro-
cess of the manufacturing of assemblies at the plant.

The main cause of the appearance of damages in fuel element jacket is, evidently,
the development of hidden defects which are not revealed during inspection at the

plant.

The amount of deposits of corrosion products on the fuel element surface is insig-
nificant [69] and cannot lead to serious disturbances in the heat removal. This is
.explained to a considerable degree by the absence of stagnant sense in the assemb-
lies. The detected deposits have a dark brown color against the background of a
dark grey oxide film of the fuel element jackets and are removed easily with a wad
of cotton. Stagnant vones appear in the gaps between the covers of the assemblies.
Therefore, there are more corrosive deposits on the surfaces of the covers of assem-
blies which are activated in the neutron flux. If the water regime is disturbed,
the activated corrosion products deposited on the covers of the assemblies and de-
vices within the vessel can spread over the entire I circuit and increase the radio-
active contamination of the equipment.

Studies of spent assemblies make it possible to obtain information about the work-
ing conditions of the fuel in the reactor.

Studies of Fuel Burnup:

Gamma-spectrometric studies of spent fuel elements make it possible to determine the
absolute values of fuel burnup, burnup distribution over the cross section and the
height of the assemblies, and a number of other characteristics [70-72]. The method
of gaumn-spectrometry of fission fragments makes it possible to conduct burnup mea-
surements without preliminary rsdiochemicsl reprocessing of the irradiated fuel.

For the burnup evaluation, fission fragments and the products of their decay having
a high yield and a sufficiently large half-life are selected (Table 8.7).

In the hot chamber of NVAES, gamma-spectra of fission fragments are determined by a
semiconductor germanium~1ithium detector with the use of a multichannel analyzer.
When an assembly is taken apart, fuel elements are installed in front of the colli-
mator and are moved along the height in relation to the detector (Figure 8.3). By
using the multichannel analyzer, it is possible to resolve well gamma-lines of 513
kev from 85Kr and 1Mm; 605 and 796 kev 1346s, 622 Rev l“Ru, 724 and 757 kev 85Zr,
and others.

Nuclear fuel burnup is determined by using gamma-lines of isotopes 1376s and 105Ru.
Isotope 137Cs has a large yield during the fission of 1350 and 239Pu. 1°6Ru has a
preferential yield from the fission of 239Pu and 24’Pu nuclei. The absolute burnup
is determined by comparing the intensity of the gamma-line of 137C: of the fuel be-
ing studied and the standard cesium source.

Table 8.8 shows an example of the results of measurements of fuel burnup in assem-
blies of wen-210 and wan-365. The error in the determination of 2350 burnup does
not exceed 3101, and that of 239Pu -- 3151.

The gamme-spectrometric method of burnup determination is checked by the mass-spec-
trometric method.

11.1. Reactor Plant

The reactor plant ver-looo of block V at HVAES (Figure 11.1) contains, as compared
to vvzn-aao, a number of changes in its design, layout and technological features
which reflect the modern level of the development of VVER-type reactors.* These
changes improved substantially the reliability and safety of operation, as well as
improved the technical and economic indexes of the power unit as a whole. At the
same time, there is a certain continuity with respect to its design and a technologi-
cal solution vhich demonstrated its high effectiveness [130-132].

The development of highly productive equipment, primarily the main circulation pumps
GTsN-l95 and steam generators PGV-IOOO, made it possible to increase considerably the
thermal power of the reactor and switch to a four-loop scheme of the reactor plant.

GTsN-l95 is a vertical centrifugal-type pump with a sealed shaft and an external asyn-
chronous electric motor equipped with flywheel masses. The basic characteristics of
GTsN-l95 are as follows:

Pump capacity, m3/h 20,000

ing cavitational wear of the rotating blades increases when the temperature rises and

is 15-20 kg-f/cm2 at a temperature of 150°C. At 250°C, the above minimum permissible
value of pressure increases to 50 kg-f/cmz.

The presence of a flywheel increases substantially the rotor's moment of inertia,
which ensures the required cooling of the reactor core in transient modes without
taking special measures for increasing the reliability of electric power supply. For
example, in a no-current mode, the delivery of the GTsN-19S decreases to 10/27 in 30
seconds, while the effective delivery of the low-inertia GTsN-310 used in the reactor
plants VVER-bho drops practically to zero in three seconds.

The presence of the GTsN with flywheel masses increases the permissible power of the
reactor in comparison with VVER-bbo during operation on an incomplete number of loops,
which, for VVER-lOOO, is 751 of the nominal value when working on three loops and 50%
in working on two loops. In order to prevent the escape of radioactive coolant of
circuit I through the stuffing-box seal of the GTsN shaft, provisions are made for
delivering blocking water into the chamber of the stuffing-box seal. The flow rate
of the blocking water after the main stages and the end sealing delivered by a system
of organized streams is not over 3.5 m3/h. The flow r.te of the blocking water into
the first circuit is not over 0.6 m3/h.

Steam generator PGV-lOOO is a horizontal single-hull heat exchanger with a submerged
pipe bundle. The basic characteristics of PGV-1000 are as follows (also see Introduc-
tion):

Thermal power, H" 750
Average heat transfer coefficient (without consider-
ation for deposits), kH/(m2-°C) 6.03

The main circulation pipelines of VVER-IOOO of unit V at NVAES, as well as on VVBR-
640 have main shut-off gate valves (622) which make it possible to shut off loops
'with malfunctioning equipment and to operate the reactor at intermediate power levels.
The 622 of VVBR-lOOO, unlike the 622 of vvsa-aao, has a parallel-plate shut-off gate.
The main characteristics of the 622 of VVER-lOOO at the nominal parameters of the
heat-transfer agent are as follows:

through the stuffing box along the rod of the electric drive is diverted by an or-
ganized leakage system.

K0 of VVBR-IOOO is connected by pipeline 0u-350 with the permanently connected part
of the "hot" thread of one of the loops of circuit 1. The upper part of the ID has
a Du-l75 sleeve connected with the "cold" thread of one of the loops of circuit I
which serves for injecting "cold” coolant if it is necessary to lower the pressure
in the K0. There is also a Du-l75 sleeve for removing excess steam through pulsed
safety devices into the bubbler tank (33).

A substantial difference of the reactor plant VVER-IOOO of unit V of NVABS from the
plants of the preceding generation is the presence of safety systems ensuring emer-
gency cooling of the reactor core in the case of a seal failure of the main circula-
tion circuit (down to a failure with instantaneous bursting of the main circulation
pipeline uu-8SO) and localization of the aftereffects of the failure within the limits
of the reinforced-concrete protective shielding of the reactor [132].

The system of emergency cooling of the reactor core (SAOZ) includes a passive assem-
bly (hydrocapacities) and emergency shutdown cooling pumps (ARR). Moreover, cooling
water can be delivered to the loops of the reactor by emergency injection pumps (AVN)
whose main purpose is to ensure the subcriticality of the core, as well as by makeup
pumps (PM) through the scavenging return line.

The passive assembly of SAOZ consists of four cavities filled with borated water with
the concentration of boric acid of 16 g/kg H20. The cavities are connected in pairs
by Du-300 pipelines with the upper and lower mixing chambers of the reactor. The
pipelines have nonreturn valves separating the cavities of the SAOZ from the reactor
during normal operation. The cavities have safety valves protecting them from exces-
sive rise of pressure in the case of a seal failure of the nonreturn valves. The
pipelines connecting the cavities withlhe reactor also have quick-action gate valves
which cut off the cavities from the reactor when the valves are triggered after the
level of the borated water in the cavities drops to the minimum level, which prevents
the entry of nitrogen into circuit I and the impairment of heat exchange in the re-
actor core. The main characteristics of the hydrocavities are as follows:

Total volume, In3 60
Water volume, In3 50
Working parameters:
pressure, .tg-f/cm2 60

second 70
Internal diameter of the body, m 3.2
Height of the tank (with sleeves), m 8.7

Emergency shutdown cooling pumps serve for delivering cooling water into the reactor
vessel, as well as into one of the loops of circuit I after the triggering of hydro-
capacities under emergency conditions when there is a seal failure in circuit I, and
for planned cooling of circuit I to temperatures below 150 degrees c. The main char-
acteristics of the ARN of VVER-lOOO are as follows:

Under emergency conditions, ARN pump borated water with the concentration of boric
acid of 16 g/kg 320 from three tanks with emergency reserve: of boron solution, each
of 582 m3 effective volume. when these tanks are emptied, the ARR switch to opera-
tion according to the following scheme: adjoining basement of the reactor room --
emergency shutdown cooling heat exchangers -- reactor. "hen ARN are used in the mode
of planned shutdown cooling, the coolant of circuit I is pumped from the "hot" thread
of one of the loops and delivered to the emergency shutdown cooling heat exchangers.
After cooling, the coolant is returned by the ARN pumps to the lower mixing chamber
of the reactor through the emergency cooling pipelines or to the "cold" thread of one
of the loops of circuit I.

Bmergenct injection pumps deliver boric acid solution with the concentration of 30
g/kg 320 from the tank with a concentrated boric acid solution of 150 m3 to the
"cold" threads of three loops of circuit I. AVN are turned on in the modes with em-
ergency shutdown cooling of circuit I and maintain the core of the reactor in the
subcritical state. The main characteristics of AV“ are as follows:

Number of pumps per block 3
Delivery capacity of one pump, m3/h 150
Temperature of pumped liquid, °C . 20 - 60
Pressure in the pressure nossle, kg-f/cmz 106
Height of one unit, t 7.75

Makeup pumps (PN) regulate the water and chemical conditions of circuit 1. PR de-
liver scavenging water into the return line with necessary additions of chemical re-
agents, such as boric acid, from the feed water deaerators of circuit I. The main
characteristics of PN are as follows:

Number of pumps per block 3

Maximum output pressure, kg-f/cm2 200
Temperature of pumped liquid, °C 70
Height of one unit, t 12.3

The necessity in the inspection and repairs of radioactive equipment during preventive
maintenance and major overhaul jobs and reloading of the reactor core is taken into
consideration in the layout of the equipment of the VVBR-lOOO reactor room of the

unit V of NVAES to a considerably greater degree than in the previous designs. For
example, there are inspection shafts for the upper block of the reactor vessel, the
block of protective pipes, devices and structures of the reactor with the necessary
protective, maintenance and crane equipment.

The reliability and operational safety of the reactor plant are improved considerably
by a regular tensiometric system for the equipment of circuit I (vessel and lid of
the reactor, pins, gate valves, steam generators) which hasatntal of 349 tensiore-
sistors, as well as an external inspection system and nondistructive ultrasound
inspection system of the reactor vessel.

Generally, the VVER-lo reactor plant 0 unit V at the NVABS meets the modern re-

quirements for the tee ucal characteris ics, operating conditions and safety for
VVER-type reactor plan .

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY-

Accelerated introduction of ABS power capacities planned for the next few decades
will be ensured by standardization of the main equipment of VVER-lOOO reactor plants.
In the near future, it is planned to construct series blocks with VVER-IOOO in which
the main equipment of the reactor department will be practically analogous to the
equipment of unit V of NVAES. The differences are due to the changes in the design
of the core and the internal vessel equipment, the absence of 622 on main circulation
pipelines, further improvement of $02, and others.

Later, it is planned to use modernized series-produced reactor plants with vertical-
type steam generators and new GTsN [132].

11.2. Steam Turbine Plant

The basic diagram of the steam turbine plant of the energy block of VVBR-lOOO of
unit V of NVABS is analogous to the traditional thermal circuits of ABS with VVBR.
The differences bathe designs are connected with the improvement of the parameters
of steam-power equipment and ensuring a safer and reliable operation of turbine
units [123-130] .

The steam from the steam generators is delivered to two turbines through four high-
pressure steam pipelines which have the following characteristics:

Rated pressure, kg-f/cm2 86
Rated temperature, °C 300
hydraulic test pressure, kg-f/cmz 110
Site of the pipe of the pipeline (diameter

X wall thickness), mm 630x25

In the rated operation mode of the energy unit, each turbine receives stean from two
steam generators. The turbine unit consists of a K-500-60/1500-type condensing tur-
bine, a TGV—SOO-a generator and a nTV-SOO-b brushless exciter. The turbine (Figure
11.2) consists of two cylinders. The first combines parts of high (chVD) and sodium
(ChSD) pressures. The second cylinder is a low pressure cylinder (Talb) [128]. The
basic rated chatecteristics of the turbine are:

Specific heat consumption (gross), kcal/kﬂ'h 2563
Frequency of shaft rotation, rpm 1500
Steam consumption per turbine, t/h 3135
Rated pressure of life steam in front of combined
valves. kg-f/cln2 60

After the ChVD, intermediate separation and two-stage steam superheating in two
separators-superheaters (SPP) are organised. They have the following character-
istics:

Flow rate of heating steam of the first stage

to steam superheater PP-l, t/h 37.7
Flow rate of heating steam of the second stage

After each TsND of each turbine, the dead steam is condensed in tea K-22550-type
condensers. The condenser is a surface, two-pass, two-stream, lateral-type conden-
ser. The cooling circulation water is delivered to the upper and lover halves of
the condensers by pumps. The basic characteristics of the condenser are:

Rated steam pressure at the inlet, kg-f/cm2 0.06
Temperature of cooling water, °c 22
Flow rate of cooling water to two condensers
of one turbine, m3/h 91650

The condensate is delivered by pumps (three items) into the regeneration circuit
consisting of four low-pressure heaters (PND), a deaerator (D) for removing gases
(chiefly oxygen) dissolved in the feed water and three high-pressure heaters (PVD)
(Table 11.1). The draining of the condensate of the heating steam (drainage) of
WI) progresses in stages: from PVD-7 to WD-6, from PVD-6 to D, from ms to PND-lo;
provision is made for switching the drainage of WD-G to PVD-S. The drainage from
PHD-lo is directed to the external drainage cooler 00-4, from there to PHD-3, from
which condensate is pumped by the drainage pump DN-Z to the main condensate line.
The drainage from PND-Z is directed to 0D-2, from there to PHD-l, from which the
condensate is pumped by the drainage pump DN-l to the main condensate line. The
condensate of the heating steam from "-2 gravitates into PVD-7, and the condensate

12.4. Utilization of Spent Fuel of VVER

Reusing the fuel unloaded from reactors is one of the reserves for lowering the fuel
component of the cost of electric energy, because spent fuel assemblies stored in
cooling ponds can be considered as a potential reserve of additional nuclear fuel.

As a rule, some of the unloaded fuel assemblies still have sufficiently high breed-
ing properties (Rana :’ 1.0). This depends greatly on the ways the reactor is oper-
ated, for example: the presence of a range in the burnup fraction of the unloaded
fuel assemblies and average burnup fraction of the fuel in the core by the moment of
the shutdown of the reactor for replacing the fuel; distribution of energy release

in the fuel assemblies in the course of the last run; the assumption of the necessary
length of the next run; the assumption of the necessary distribution of energy re-
lease in the fuel assemblies in the course of next run of the reactor and the re-
quirements of maintaining the synmetry in loading connected with this, particularly
in rejecting individual underfired fuel assemblies, for example, by the results of
the inspection of the sealing of fuel element jackets.

The underfired nuclear fuel unloaded due to the above reasons, can be reused in one
of the following loadings of the same reactor when, for example, it is required to
replace an underfired fuel assembly with a revealed leaky condition of its jacket.

Uhderfired fuel assemblies kept for a certain period of time in the cooling pond are
reloaded into the reactor after an additional nondistructive inspection of the con-
dition of the fuel elements. For example, incompletely burnt assemblies were reused
on many occasions in the reactors of units I and Il at NVABS, as a result of which
experience was accumulated, confirming a high effectiveness of the fuel elements used
in VVER [53]. Incompletely burnt fuel assemblies were reused in the same reactor al-
though, as was mentioned in section 12.3, it is more practical to reuse assemblies
unloaded from reactors with a higher average working temperature of the core, i.e.,
with a higher water and fuel temperature, in reactors with a lower average tempera-
ture of the core and lower specific energy release.

The burnup fraction of the nuclear fuel of VVBR can also be increased by using spent
assemblies unloaded from the reactor for producing thermal energy at atomic boiler
plants, which makes it possible to inc:ease the average burnup fraction in assemblies
by 3000-6000 HM-day/t U [53. 121]. Evaluations of the neutron-physics characteris-
tics of the reactor of the atomic boiler plant indicate that each energy unit of an
ABS with VVBR-bbo can provide fuel for a rayon boiler plant of 250 NH with a reactor
containing 3&9 spent assemblies of the supplier reactor operating in the annual re-
loading mode. The power unit of an atomic boiler plant can be put into operation

4-5 years after the starting of an ABS reactor, i.e., after the accumulst‘:u of a
sufficient number of assemblies for the first loading of the boiler plant reactor.

It is possible to lower the fuel component of the cost of VVER energy by industrial- '
scale chemical reprocessing of unloaded nuclear fuel containing 2350, plutonium and
other transuranium elements of great practical value. uranium and plutonium sepa-
rated from radioactive fission products can be used in producing fuel elements for
thermal and fast neutron reactors. The possibility and economic practicality of us-
ing plutonium as a nuclear fuel without violating the safety requirements of the op-
eration of atomic power and heat generating plants have been proven both theoreti-
cally and experimentally [122]. Moreover, exposed nuclear fuel, among all fission
products of uranium and plutonium isotopes, contains individual radioactive isotopes
or groups of isotopes which, having been separated from the spent nuclear fuel, can
be of practical value in using them as radiation sources in various areas of science,
as well as in industry, agriculture and medicine.

The most promising fission product used for producing gamma-sources include 1370s
which has a hal’-life of 30 years. 1370s is used as a radioactive indicator and tag
for stable cesium in various physicochemical studies. Low-activity cesium sources
are used widely in industry in instruments for measuring thicknesses, density, con-
centration and levels of various substances. Cesium sources of medium and high ac-
tivity are used widely in gamma-defectoscopy of materials and weld seams, in gamma-
ray therapy, for processing foodstuffs and sterilization of medical materials. The
heat released during radioactive decay of 1370s is used very widely in isotopic gen-
erators of thermal and electrical energy which are long-life sources of electric
power supply for navigational and meteorological instruments and stations. Another
fission-fragment isotope used for practical and scientific purposes is 908r; together
with its daughter isotope 9°Y, it is an excellent beta-radiator and is used widely

for manufacturing beta-sources for various technological monitoring instruments, for
removing electrostatic charges, as well as for making thermal units of isotopic gen-
erators of electric energy, including those for communication satellites.

Among fission-fragment radioactive isotopes of rare-earth elements, 1M'Ce and 1‘7Pm
are of practical interest. They can also be used for creating thermal generators of
electric energy.

In spite of the fact that some other elements obtained in reactors, such as 6000.
170Tm, 210P0, 238Pu, 241Am, 2426m and 2‘4Cn, can be used in radio-isotopic genera-
tors of energy, fission fragment isotopes are used more widely because of their
considerably lower costs (Table 12.2).

Fission-fra ent isotopes 1°6Ru, 952r and 14°Ba which are used with their daughter

isotopes 1° Rh, 95Nb and 1"0h, respectively, are of interest as sources of gamma-

radiation. Radioactive isotopes of iodine containing in fission products have many
practical applications, particularly in medicine.
