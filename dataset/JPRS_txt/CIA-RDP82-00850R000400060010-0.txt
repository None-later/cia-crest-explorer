FIRST SRV VESSEL IN ODESSA
Moscow MDRSKOY PLOT in Russian Aug 81 p 6

[Article and photograph by A. Levit: "Friendship Hatch on the Piers"]

[Text] In March of 1981 the diesel motor ship "Song Duong" docked in the port
of Odessa. This was the first vessel from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to

arrive in Odessa.

Dock workers knew of the approach of the "Song Duong" and awaited its arrival
with impatience. having thought through, down to its smallest detail, the entire
course of the forthcoming unloading operation. That is why, immediately after a
meeting held on board the diesel motor ship, a decision was made to meet with
all interested parties and to discuss the plan of operations. Signed at that
meeting was the firs; agreement on an extensive socialist competition between
Vietnamese seamen, dock workers from the port's second rayon, and railroad
workers from the Port of Odessa station. Rayon Chief G. Tankov, Captain

Ngo Din' Kkhoy, UKB No 208 Brigade Leader N. Tymun' and Railroad Station Chief
V. Shokot'ko were the signatories. Dock workers resolved to reduce the layover
tune of freight cars by no less than 5 percent and to reload the ship's cargo
intact and in a high-quality manner. The Vietnamese seamen vowed to do everything
in their power to assist the dock workers. The railroad workers promised to
provide freight cars on time and to be prompt in bringing out the loaded cars.

'nme Vietnamese vessel delivered traditional export items to our nation: parquet
flooring, jute. tea. shoes, rugs and sewn goods plus matting--more than 4,000 tons

of cargo.

Each day it was necessary tr unload more than 600 tons of goods from the ship and
to either load them into railroad cars or to store them in warehouses in order

to keep to the schedule agreed upon in the contract.
it is practically impossible to conduct freight Operations rapidly when you
consider that the goods delivered have not been packaged. However, the Komsomol

youth brigade led by Nikolay Tymun' mobilized all of its ability and applied
maximum effort in order to adequately cope with the tasks set by the contract.

He figure that, every day, the brigade fulfilled its daily assignment by no less
than 150 percent and reached 180 to 200 percent on certain days. Dock worker
collectives led by D. Novitskiy, V. Pogrebenko and N. Dobrenko also worked
successfully. We also visited the “Song Duong" on the last, the tenth day of
unloading operations.

He were welcomed aboard with a smile by a likeable young man who greeted us in
good Russian with "A good day to you, one and all..."

While accompanying us to the captain's cabin, Nguen Toin (for such was the young
man's name) told us that he had studied at the Odessa Higher Marine Engineering
School, from which he had successfully graduated in 1973. He was now senior
engineer aboard the "Song Duong."

"It has been 7 years since I have been in Odessa. I am very glad to be in this
remarkable city and port again," Nguen said. lie that went on to assist us in our
conversation with the ship's captain, Ngo Din' Kkhoy.

"the port workers are doing an excellent job," the captain stated. "We have seen
in practice how it is possible to speed up ship processing under conditions in
which the number of vessels arriving in port is sharply increasing. Back in the
past, our nation had its own fleet but one which could be used only for short
trips. But now, thanks to the aid of the Soviet Union and other nations which are
members of CEHA, we have trained our own personnel and have acquired new ships.
Our diesel motor ships are modern, universal-purpose vessels which can carry about
18 different types of cargo."

During the course of our conversation with the captain, which took place on the
ship's bridge, the gas turbine ship "Kapitan Smirnov" was making its departure

from the port. Upon catching sight of this large, ocean-going roll on-roll oft'
container ship, the senior mechanic excitedly began to say something to the
captain. Then, turning to us, Nguen Toin explained that the young Vietnamese

fleet was not only glad for the successes of their Soviet comrades but was learning
from them also.

The captain was delighted with the mastery with which that large Soviet vessel
was being handled. Our camera captured the moment when the Vietnamese seamen
were attentively watching the "Kaptain Smirnov." He decided to photograph the
captain, who brought the first SRV vessel into the port of Odessa, in all of

his captain's regalia. It turned out, however, that the fleet of Socialist
Vietnam is too young for its seamen to have their own uniforms as yet. But no
matter, that will only make this photograph more interesting a few years from now.

"Our trip to Odessa," first mate Nguen Suan Tam said, "has once more confirmed
that the friendship between the SRV and the great Soviet Union, that the policy
of the CPSU directed at the expansion and deepening of all-round ties with
fraternal nations of Socialism, is based on the eternal living teachings of
Marxism—Leninism, on our joint struggle for peace and democracy."
