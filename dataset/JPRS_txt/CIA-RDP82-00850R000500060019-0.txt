[Text] This article examines the possibilities of creating ultrasonic thermo-
stablc delay lines with rectangular acoustic conductors of monocrystalline quartz.
It is shown that thermostable lines with delay of up to 100 usec can be created
by changing the ratio of the dimensions of the acoustic conductor along the Y and
z crystallographic axes. To achieve delay times exceeding 100 usec, the rec-
tangular contour of the acoustic conductor must be rotated through a slight angle
about the crystallographic x-axis of the quartz. Five illustrations, 8 biblio-

Foreword
Radars. hyperbolic radio navigation system indicators and radio direction finders
are now used extensively aboard vessels in the merchant fleet. More than 10
different types of devices are in use which are based on complicated electronic
circuits containing large numbers of tubes, transistors and integrated modules.
In modern technology, where complex electronic circuits are used, the latter can
be studied thoroughly enough at the level of functional diagrams consisting of

individual elementary sections. or modules, whose schematic diagrams are familiar.
This principal extends to the radio navigation devices considered in the present

text, regardless of the component base on which they are constructed. In this
case, the basis of the device circuit which is studied is the functional diagram,
which reflects the connections between individual components and controls.

demonstrate the rules for transforming and simplifying graphs and determining the cur-
rent amplitude in passive dipoles and finding the input impedance of an active radia-

[Text] This article examines the propagation of weak radio waves in an isotropic
ionosphere perturbed by a vertically incident and reflected powerful radio wave.
The two-scale expansion method is used to derive a system of "truncated" equations
which describes the reflection of radio waves from a quasipariodic structure
(array) in the region of the first Bragg resonance. A qualitative analysis of

the solution of this system is given for two practically important cases. It

is demonstrated that when the perturbing transmitter is powerful enough the
coefficient of reflection from the array may be of the order of unity. 7 illustra-

IﬂVESTIGATION 0P LOVER IONOSPHKRB USING PULSED CROSS-MODULATION METHOD
[Abstract of article by N.I. Irrayleva]

[Text] This article is devoted to an effective study of the lower ionosphere using
a modified pulsed cross-modulation method. The theory of nonlinear interaction

of high-power pulsed radio waves is developed. The cross-modulation coefficients
are analyzed quantitatively as a function of the equipment parameters as well as

the ionospheric parameters. Practical recommendations are given on the selection
of optimal experimental conditions for achieving the highest cross-modulation
coefficient values. The methodology developed for solving the inverse proble-

is applied to concrete experimental data on amplitude cross-modulation. It is

shown that the modified pulsed cross-nodulation method using powerful radio waves
makes it possible to define the practically instantaneous profiles of the parameters
of the lower ionosphere (electron concentratioa, collision frequency, etc.), and

to study its dynamics and fine structure. 7 illustrations, 1 table, so bibliograph-

mean phase velocity for arbitrary paths with a given orientation. The use of
the method at points located more than 1000 kilometers in the direction of pro-
pagation from the radio transmitter when the underlying surface conductivity is
uniform ensures that the measured phase velocity. is practically independent of
distance. The method can be used to cross-reference the time scales of any

objects located along the direction coinciding with the placement of the synchroni-z

[Abstract of article by L.Ya. Vorob'yev]

[Text] This article investigates the seasonal variation in phase delays t of
superblong waves on long paths during periods with equal illumination. It is

shown that spectral analysis of the diurnal phase variations or makes it possible
to determine the periodic comonente of the phase variation on paths with equal
illumination. The primary regular components have periods of a year and of

six nonths. During the day these variations relate to variations in the effective
altitude of the lower ionosphere. The amplitude-phase characteristics 7,, at

night are different from the daytime values for the corresponding process harmonica.

[Text] This article examines different methods for recording signals taken fro-
the receiver output during pulsed ionospheric sounding. The simplest method is
magnetic tape recording using pulse frequency undulation. The use of a crystal-
controlled pilot signal in the record-reproduce section during pulse frequency
modulation recording makes it possible to reduce significantly the distortions
caused by nonuniformity of the magnetic medium. "hen the signal is recorded on
magnetic tape, conputer interfacing is simplified significantly. 1 illustration,

[Abstract of article by P.I. Pedos'kin]

[Text] This article examines the influence of severe pulsed radio interference
on a receiver containing an envelope detector with square-law response and an
accumulator with linear response with a range selector connected between them.

An expression is obtained for the gain in accumulation of the oblique backseatter
ionospheric sounding signal resulting from the action of pulsed interference.

It is shown that this gain is usually between 1 and 6 dB. The false alarm
probability is found as a function of accumulation time. 2 illustrations, 5

INTERNAL GRAVITY "AVIS AS TURBULIZATION SOURCE FOR LOHER TUBRHOSPNERE
[Abstract of article by 3.1. Ginsburg and 0.1. Karin]

[Text] A wave equation solution is found for short gravity waves in the vicinity
of the reflection point for a linear atmospheric layer considering viscosity and
thermal conductivity. It is shown that the vertical component of the short
gravity wave wind velocity increases resonantly to values for which allowance
must be made for nonlinear processes at a special point on the short gravity
wave index of refraction located beyond the reflection point. It is proposed
that this resonance effect is the source of turbulization of the medium. An
analytical expression for the relative altitude profile of the coefficient of
turbulent diffusion K7 is obtained on the basis of estimates of semi-empirical
turbulence theory. Comparison of the altitude profiles of K1 obtained for dif-
ferent seasons with experinental profiles in the 50-130 kn region shows satisfac-
tory coincidence. 3 illustrations, lb bibliographic references.

Ishkin and Isaak Iosifovich Tsitver, reviewed by V. T. Lavrnshin, Energoiadat,
7000 copies, 208 pages]

[Text] This book examines problems associated with the design of mm for
transmitting information over conductors in extremely high voltage power
transmission lines. Included are: examination of the structural design char-
acteristics of power lines as they detemine the parueters of channel carrier
paths, as well as circuits for interconnecting carrier channel equipnent to
conductors of power lines with split phases and grounded guard cables; analysis
of the relationship of ice and met deposits on conductors to losses in car-
rier paths; presentation of a probabilistic method for desiping power line
carrier channels and a construct for arranging frequency subdivision of a
power network; introduction of intonation concerning carrier channel devices.

The book is intended for technical engineering personnel involved in the de-
sign and application of power line carrier communication channels, as well as
for students specializing in the methodology of supervisory and technical
control of power systens.

Foreword

The for-ation of the Consolidated Electric Power System of the USSR was achiev-
ed by unifying the power systeuas of Siberia and Central Asia with the European
Electric Power System, and by the installation of trunk lines designed for the
transmission of 500, 750 and 1150 IN. Current proposals call for the imple-
mentation of power lines capable of translaitting dc voltages of 1500 and 2200 W.

Creation of the national Consolidated Electric Power System is closely connect-
ed to the introduction of ultra-odern control systems employing computer-based
technology. This in turn leads to quantitative and qualitative changes in the
now of intonation through the network, resulting in more exacting require-
ments for comications techniques within the power engineering field itself.

In this regard, the nest important task to be confronted within the next five
to seven years is the establishmt of the Unified Power-Line Co-uunications
NetworkWPCN), which will ensure the resolution of inherent problems of oper-
ational supervision and control of power facilities, as well as control of
power systea construction.

An important position within the overall framework of UPON is reserved for
carrier comication(CC) over electric power lines(PI.), which, at the present
time, is the prisery method of comunication employed in power systems, in
fact, its importance continues to grow in step with the ever-widening use of
super-high and ultra-high voltage power lines.

The aim of the present work is to illuminate the basic issues associated with
the management of carrier conunications over super-high and ultra-high vol-
tage power lines. The text sets forth the results of theoretical and snori-
nental investigations of the parameters of CC paths in such transmission lines,
which were carried out chiefly at the 'Eknrgoset'proyekt'ﬂll-Union Order of
the October Revolution State Planning and S and Scientific Investiga-
tory Institute of Power System and Power Networks , as well as at a meter of
other scientific-investigatory organisations of the 158R MinmergoIHinistry of
Power and Electrification](VIlIIE[An-Union Scientific Research Institute of
Electric Power higineeringJand NIIPT[Scientific Research Institute of Radio
and TelevisionJ). Also included is a discussion of the characteristics or
equipment eulployed in systems for transnitting information over extremely high
voltage power lines.

The book is based primarily on new circuit designs proposed by the authors in
recent years for the interconnection of equipent to electric power lines and
on new methods for the design of power line cc channels, but also on new de-
vices which provide for increased reliability and quality of intonation
transmitted over electric power lines. Results of the work of a umber of
other researchers have also been used in the book.

[Text] Principles of the theory and design of multichannel frequency-
separation devices which are also called multiplexers are examined in this
book. The principles of the construction and calculation of the basic
elements which make up frequency-separation devices of various types for
given frequency properties in elements with concentrated and distributed
parameters are set forth. Some of these methods are based on optisization

of frequency-separation device parameters using a computer.

Specific examples of the use of frequency-separation devices in various
radio engineering devices and systems are given.

The book is intended for radio engineers involved in the development and
design of modern radioelectronic systems who are working in the field of
radio engineering and the theory of electrical circuits.

Foreword

Multichannel radioelectronic devices and systems with frequency separation
of channels are widely used. A large number of examples of such systems
and devices could be mentioned. They include: radio engineering communica-
tions systems, radar. and navigation which include several radio transmitters
and receivers which use a single antenna at various frequencies; multiple
program television centers which consist of a set of inage and audio trans-
mitters with a common antenna system; special broadband devices (amplifiers.
matching circuits), in which a broad band is attained by adding the effects
of relatively narrow-band components; devices for separating a set of
signals (or a broadband signal) into cosponents which do not overlap on the
spectra and many others.

Some of the most important elements of such systems are multichannel
frequency-separation devices, which are also called multiplexers. These
devices provide separation (or adding) of frequency channels and elimination
of the interaction between them (decoupling).

The published literature contains many articles on frequency-separation
devices. however, these are unrelated articles, authors' certificates and
patents which are devoted to specific practical realizations and to studies
of specific problems of their analysis and calculation.

Hany very important aspects of the theory and design of frequency-separation
devices have been inadequately examined. Among them are problems of designing
frequency-separation devices using elements with concentrated constants,
frequency separation devices with adjacent wideband channels, problems of
providing frequency-independent matching of frequencyvseparation devices for
all its inputs and other problems.

This book, which is devoted to multichannel frequency—separation devices,
makes an attempt to examine systematically problems of the theory, design
and calculation of frequency-separation devices and their component elements
for various applications and frequency ranges.

The book is based on the modern theory of multiterminal electrical circuits
and their calculation and design using a computer.

The book examines frequency-separation devices with concentrated elements
and strip lines as well as principles of the construction and synthesis of
frequency-separation devices which use noninterchangeable elements (circu-
lators). Supplements to the book give circuits and tables of normalized
values of elements of two- and multichannel frequencyvseparation devices.

The authors wish to thank Candidate of Technical Sciences A. Ye. Znamenskiy
and Doctor of Technical Sciences Yu. L. Khotuntsev who made a number of
valuable comments in reviewing the manuscript.

FUNDAMENTALS OF FREQUENCY SYNTHESIS THEORY

[Annotation. foreword and table of contents from book "Fundamentals of the
Theory of Frequency Synthesis," by David “with Shapiro and

Aleksandr Abrenovich Pain, reviewed by A. S. Galin, Izdatel'stvo "Radio 1
svyaz'", 5000 copies, 26!. pages]

[Text] The basic problens of the theory of constructing frequency synthesis
systems are set forth. Their structural arrangements are analysed and
certain methods of the design and calculation of their elenents are presented.
Particular attention is devoted to advanced digital active and passive fre-
quency synthesis systens. Aspects of the use of frequency synthesis systens
in radiotransnitting and radioreception devices are examined as well as
nethods for neasuring the basic paraneters of the oscillations generated

by then.

The book is intended for engineering technicians who must deal with fre--
quency synthesis systens in their work. It can also be used by students
of radio-engineering technical institutes.

Foreword

Frequency synthesis netth (the old nane is nethods of spectral-crystal
stabilization) began to be developed rapidly at the end of the 1940s.

It became necessary to improve frequency accuracy of radio transnitter
enitted oscillations in the 1930s in order to avoid nutual interference.

Sets of crystal vibrators. one'for each working wave (hence the neat
"crystal-wave method") began to be used by radio stations. The vibrators
were expensive, and in large quantities, up to one hundred per single radio
station, their cost was very great, thus the nunber of stabilized frequencies
regained very limited. It soon became obvious that it would be necessary to
assure accurate tuning frequency for the receivers for non-searching es-
tablishment of conunication and tuning-free reception. especially for the
new types of operation such as carrier telegraphy and double frequency

telegraphy, single-band modulation, relative phase telegraphy, etc. This
required further increases in the number of crystal vibrators used and
therefore it stimulated the search for methods which would help one to
assure the 181808t possible number of stabilized transmitter or receiver
frequencies with minimal number of crystal vibrators. The mobile radio
station RAT was established in the USSR in 1937 under the direction of

G. A. Zeytlenk. Its transmitter was the first one to use the method of
spectrum-crystal stabilization. The first foreign publication of the
methods of spectrum-vibrator stabilization occurred in 1943 [3]. Many
scientists and researchers of various countries participated in developing
the theory and techniques of frequency synthesis in the ensuring years.
Soviet specialists made significant contributions to this area of science
and technology, chief among them being V. S. Dulitskiy (1912-1966).

Frequency synthesis theory has become an independent scientific discipline
in recent years. It embraces frequency synthesis systems, devices which
allow one to generate oscillations with any of a certain number of discrete
frequencies or several such oscillations Simultaneously With varying fre-
quencies with frequency accuracy and stability which are determined by a
single frequency standard.

The newest achievements of radio electronics are used in frequency synthe-
sis engineering: semiconductor devicee, integrated microcircuits, parametric
systems, microprocessors, computers, atomic frequency standards, etc.

A number of monographs, a large number of articles in the periodical press.
patents, advertising reports, manufacturers' brochures have dealt with
frequency synthesis systems. Monographs of Soviet authors I36, 67, 77, 92]
and a monograph translated from English [93] have been published in the
Soviet Union. All these books are intended for specialists in this field.

This book is intended for engineers in radio electronics and electrical
communicati “s. It could also be profitably used by teachers and students
of radio engineering departments of technical institutes. This book is
based on lecture notes used by the authors at technical institutes.

In setting forth the theoretical problems the authors have tried to combine
rigor and depth with accessibility. The choice of subassemblies and devices
to be described was made with a view to present a minimum of illustration
material which would present the basic problems of this branch of engineering.
current possibilities of quality improvement and modern engineering solutions.

The engineering solutions discussed in the book and the examples given in it
are primarily in a range of not more than several hundreds of megahertz. In

principle the methods used at higher frequencies do not differ from the ones
considered here. Of specific concern here are realization of the elements:

oscillators, multipliers, dividers, adders, filters. etc. The limited scope
of the book and the still inadequate personal experience of the authors in
analyzing problems of this area do not permit them to cover this subject:
devices which use surface acoustic waves in the range up to units of gigs-
hertz are an exception to this.

Because frequency synthesis is a relatively new area of science and
technology a unified generally accepted terminology is not yet available.
There is only one standards engineering document I90] in the Soviet Union
which regulates this terminology and it applies only within the Ministry

of the Communications Industry. He have tried to adhere to this document,
but in some cases it seemed best to introduce new terms for purposes

of clear explanation. We do not expect that all specialists will adopt these
terms. Development of a commonly adopted terminology will take some time.

CBOOSING INTBGRATED CIRCUITS FOR DEVICBS FOR DIGITAL PROCESSING OF SIGNALS

Moscow RADIOTBKBNIKA in Russian Vol 36, No 6, Apr 81 (manuscript received after re-
vision 1 Jul 80) pp 22-31

[Article by V. I. Lebedev]

[Text] In recent years, the application of digital methods in processing signals
through the introduction of digital filters, analog-digital converters (are?) and
digital-analog converters (Tsar) has been expending noticeably and comparatively
rapidly. Integrated circuits which make it possible to solve the problems of the
reliability, accuracy, size-weight, and cost indexes, are becoming the element base
of traditional analog devices.

There are so many types of integrated logic circuits (ILS)* that it is not at all
simple to select the needed circuit, especially because it is always interesting to
use the most promising element on whose basis large-scale and superlarge-scele inte-
grated circuits (318' and $315) with more than 100 elements in one crystal are cre-
ated.

These BIS and 5318, along with simple and medium-scale integrated circuits (SKIS)
are used in modern radioelectronic and microelectronic equipment (NBA) intended for
digital processing of signals. Therefore, it is practical to speak of an expanded
system of elements with identical element base within the system. When selecting
standard elements of a system, it is necessary to be guided by certain criteria and
properties examined below.

Basic Criteria for Selecting the Element Base. It is advantageous to use the follow-
ing criteria for preliminary selection:

1. The speed of operation or the time of average delay t of a pulsed signal deter-
mines the maximum frequency ofdiscrete sampling of an ana og signal.

‘The handbook Ill alone contains 327 types of microcircuits combined into 48 series
of digital Is integrated circuits] and 32 series of analog Is. The Digital Inte-
grated Circuits, aura BOOK, 1978/79 lists more than 20,000 digital microcircuits,
including operating and outdated circuits.

2. Switching operation Pt 3 determines the minim power ’ya per one element
with s soundly selected t 3 and makes it possible to estimate the number of elements
in a microcircuit (degree of integration), 9 - 1’30de ya, there mop“ is the
permissible power on the IS body. '

3. Interference ill-unity makes it possible to select circuits with the necessary
and sufficient margin of interference immunity I]u matched with the level of inter-
Ml interference, as well as external interference (for 11.8).

I». Lasting drift of parameters (aging) is an important criterion under the condi-
tions of long-term operation.

5. By combining linear and digital circuits on one crystal, it is possible to per-
form a deeper estimation of the prospects of the element base.

It should be said that none of these criteria can be absolute. The problem of se-
lection is complicated also by the necessity of considering such important factors
as the level of functional integration (number of functions performed by the homo-
geneous region of the semiconductor; minimum power determined without limitations on
the frequency F1. ” of switching, temperature power factor, possibility of obtaining
a direct and an inverse output, changes in the average delay per logical function
when the number of function performed by the device increases, etc.

The above criteria and factors were taken into consideration in selecting only four
types from the known variety of logic circuits.

should be given to 121. circuits (then to enitter-functionel m, mall-signal ESL

It should be added that the base lzL-elemsnt takes up one half of the area occupied
by the HEP-element, and approximately one fifth of the area in comparison with the
m-element. Functional integration of 12!. elements is the highest. With respect
to the degree of integration, these elements are close to MVP-circuits, which were
the main elements of BIS in the course of many years. How nor, 12L circuits belong
to average-speed circuits (t3 I S 1'- 10 ns). ‘n'LSh-circui: are used most widely in
other devices of average operation speed (t3 - S -.'- 20 ns) and average level of in-
tegration. Their logical flexibility, which is due to multiple emitter input tran-
sistors, the possibility of combining simple one-inverter (Figure 1c) and complex
two-inverter (Figure la) elements in one crystal, as well as their wide use in REA
[radio electronic equipment], explain the fact that developers of SKIS and BIS

are oriented toward the 111. basis. However, the desire of the supporters of this
basis to use it in the areas of high operating speed has led to the complication of
the Til-element, which is already complicated and has two and three series-connected
p-n-junctions (in T1,T , T3 in Figure la), a relatively large value of the logic sig-
nal A U 7 2 V, an a supply voltage of E I- 5 V.

The 'l'l'lSh-circuit (Figure lb) has three stable equilibrium states ("1", "0" and
"disconnected"). The "disconnected" state is obtained when T5 is saturated, i.e.,
when the signal X3 - l is delivered. In this case, T1, and T3 are turned off and
information signals x1, X2 do not act upon the output. Consequently, it is possible
to connect to this output other analogous mSh-circuits in one of which X3 - 0,
which makes it possible to transmit information to the load through the cannon main
line. i.e., to realise the function of the "wiring" OR.

The TTL-l circuit (Figure lc) has only one inverter T2, which reduces the power Py‘
and leads to an increase of V . However, the delay time in this case increase due
to the increase of the output resistance RI 8 - 32. The m circuit is intended
for working in REA with a higher margin of ing‘rference stability U which is de-
termined by the voltage on the displacement diodes and the number of‘1 these diodes.
However, the greater is the UH , the slower is the operation speed and the greater
is the switching operation Pt3. ‘

The development of high-speed systems is conducted primarily with ESL elements which
have t3 5 3 ns and switching operation Pt3 s S pJ.

Let us examine the dependence of Pt3 on the circuit parameters using MESL-element
as an example (Figure 2b). Considering that P: BI, t3 - R15?n , A U - IRK [0“

where

der to reduce Pt3, i.e., to reduce the power P at a prescribed speed of operation,
it is necessary to reduce the supply voltage 3 and the value of the logic signal

A U, as well as to bound at the top the number of loads n and inputs In. These
conclusions were formulated earlier in work [a] and were confirmed in the series
production of a microprocessor set using HES]. and EFL-elements with B - 2 V [S] and

matrix BIS in the same basis. Analysis of the formulas for Pt3 obtained in [2] for
other promising elements shows that the conclusion about the expediency of lowering
E and AU in application to BIS is general. In other words, for digital proces-
sing of signals, it is necessary to select a small-signal and low-power element base,
i.e., 121. and HI)? structures for medium and H381. for high operation speed.

In the area of low frequencies (P1. n4 l Mlle) and very low power levels (Pm-4 0.01
p"), HOP-circuits are most effective. The development of circuits using PEP-struc-
tures progressed from p-channel through n-channel to mm (Figure 6b, c). In the
latter, the combination of mutually supplementing p and n-channel transistors en-
sures a near-zero static power P - Btu. when the switching frequency Fr I in-
creases, the dynamic component 0 power begins to increase, being equal to '

and circuit capacPtance; I 0K3 -- value of the current through borh transistors of
the key KliDP-circuit; t¢ -- buildup time of the front of the output signal.

Power P 11 H is determined, first of all, by the recharge of the capacitance cnx’
from which it follows that the load capacity of KHDP-circuits depends on the fre-

quency [7 rm:

Calculations by (3) indicate that, at B - 9 V, F 1..” - 1 line, it is possible to
obtain n - 10, while “C‘l‘ - 100.

In order to improve the operational characteristics and widen the frequency range,
intensive studies are being conducted on new MDP-structures having smaller capaci-
tances CBXO and a shorter channel length (D-MDP and V-HDP) [6]. KHDP-circuits with
a lower supply voltage (B I 1.2 ,4 1,5 V in microcircuits of the types K512 PS-Z
and K512 PS-3 [7]) are also being developed and introduced. It should be stressed
that bipolar and “DP-circuits do not exclude, but supplement one another, broaden-
ing the operation efficiency ranges of digital devices with respect to power and
frequency. There exist devices in which the best properties of bipolar and “DP-cir-
cuits are combined. These are, for example, 02!] [imdiate-access memory] with ED?-
memory matrix ensuring a low average pover, and with ESL periphery (recording and
reading amplifiers) ensuring a high operation speed in selecting information from
the 02!] crystal.

New Generation of Integrated Circuits. The couposition of the series of integrated
circuits is being expanded steadily by using circuits with greater numbers of coup.
ponents in the crystal from several dozens (18) to hundreds (SKIS) and thousands
(BIS and SBIS).

The four types of elements discussed above (m, 381., 1121., HDP) were used as a basis
of the third and fourth generations of integrated circuits: 318 and $318. A con-
siderable set of functions in these complex devices is performed by two methods:

1) matrix method of the organization of standard electronic assemblies in one cry-
stal. logic, trigger, register, adding, forming, and other circuits arranged in one
crystal in statistically substantiated numbers are connected with one another accord-
ing to customers' drawings during the stage of final metalisation (the width of the
metaliration line characterizes the level of technology and decreases from 20 pm to
2-5 pm, as well as to fractions of pm). The matrix set of standard assemblies cov-
ers the set of functions used in practice due to the definite redundancy of the ele-
ments part of which is not always used;

2) the.functiona1 method, which is distinguished by a more limited, although not
small, set of functions, but lesser redundancy. This method was realized in micro-
processor sets (HPN) which contain: a central processor element performing arithme-
tical and logical operations; a microprogram control unit; a multimode buffer regis-

ter; PZU [permanent storage], 020, and other microcircuits. The distinguishing
characteristics of HPN are as follows: a) the possibility of performing various

tasks by means of programmed, and not instrument, retuning of the HP [microproces-
sor]; b) the modular principle of building up the number of processor elements, i.e.,
of increasing the number of digits and, accordingly, the accuracy; c) the main-line
principle of transmitting information signals, i.e., the use of a limited number of
microcircuit terminals for transmitting through each one of them a certain set of
different information and address signals distributed in time. It is useful to note
that a microprocessor is only a part of a microcomputer, its component designed in
the form of a BIS and intended for processing digital information. These components
are connected with the aid of ILS compatible with respect to the levels of logical
one-output 01 and zero-output 0° signals. Consequently, integrated circuits of dif-
ferent generationssupplement each other at the present time and must be considered
jointly in this sense.

Table 2 shows the main properties and parameters of promising integrated circuits

which were used as a basis for developing microprocessors. For example, [8] TTLSh
was used as a basis for developing K589-type HP; 12L -- for K582 and Kssb-type MP,
KHDP -- for K587-type MP, n-HDP -- for KSBZ-type MP.

IZL-circuits were developed later than other 18, when it became necessary to satisfy
the needs of Bib. Therefore, the third column of the table shows only the micro-
processor (KSBh), although designs for particular uses contain IzL-circuits of lower
levels of integration, such as registers, frequency dividers, decoders, and others.
The four-digit microprocessor K584 includes 1500 I L-elements, its power consumption
is 750 mu (201 of this power is scattered in the crystal, and the remaining part --
in the external supply circuit); it works on a clock frequency of l Hﬂz. Operation
types are controlled by means of a 9-digit control word. The average time of oper-
ation performance is 'v 1 ps. Bight and sixteen-digit H? in the I L-baais have
been developed. Along with their advantages [technological effectiveness, low sup-
ply voltage (3min - 0.7 V), wide range of operating supply currents (over 6 orders)
and operating temperatures ( 4 T - -60 7' +125 degrees 0)], the following disadvan-
tages should be mentioned: a relatively low operating speed (Pr. - 1 MHz). Their
low operation speed is due not only to the peculiarities of the e ement base, but
also to the main-line principle of successive transmission of signals, which is
characteristic of microprocessors as a whole [9]. For example, in the fastest MP"
of the HS-lOBOO-type, the frequency in the ESL basis P& - 20 MHz, while the
switching frequency of the ESL of the triggers exceeds 355 MHz. The frequency

potentialities of the element base are used more effectively in proger logic
matrices (PD!) [10], whose examination is an independent problem.

Conclusions

1. The element base for devices of digital processing for signals is selected
with consideration for the technological efficiency on the basis of such particu-
lar criteria as speed of operation, switching operation R3, and interference sta-
bility.

2. The most promising elements include elements which have the lowest switching
operation Pt3 in a prescribed frequency range. They are characterised by: a small
value of supply voltage E . 2 g:- 3 V, a small value of the logic signal A. U . 0.2
+ 0.10 V, the use of mutually supplementing transistors in resistorless circuits,
the existence of a direct and an inverse outputs in one element.

3. The following are the most suitable and promising in the near future:

IzL-circuits distinguished by the lowest value of R3 {7. 0.1 5.1, the highest func-
tional integration, a unique range of supply current (10-8-10' ) A, and the possi-
bility of increasing the speed of operation from the average value (t3 - 10 ns) to
the highest (t3 - 2 -.'- 5 ns). IzL-circuits are technologically compatible with
linear IS;

MESL-circuits with the highest operation speed (t3 < 3 ns) in working in the area
of weak saturation of the transistors, low signal level AU and supply voltage

I! 43 V, branching lo;'.c in multistep circuits, compatibility with emitter-func-
tional and emitter-follower logic circuits. By using the ESL basis, linear ampli-
fiers were obtained with a threshold frequency of in Pp a 300 ms with the ampli-
fication factor Ito - 5 for a threevelement cell; '°

KMDP- and n-HDP-circuits having the lowest static power PCT 4 0.01 pH, nontri-
ticnlity to supply voltage, a high integration, directly proportional depen-
dence of the dynamic power and the Pt3 factor on the switching frequency. It is
planned to switch from a relatively low operation speed CRT." - l Mlle) to a
medium speed and later to a high speed;

TYLSh-circuits, which are characterized by the greatest variety of circuit engineer-
ing designs, the possibility of combining them with other types of 11.3, and medium
operation speed (t3 I S ,4 20 na). Topological and energy limitations (4-8 compon-
ents in one element, Pt3 G’ 30 pJ) make it difficult to use the ‘l'l'l. basis widely
in BIS and especially in 8318.

These difficulties are overcome by introducing the principle of injection power
supply not onl;- in 121., but also in m and 881. bases.

4. The above four element base types are used: a) in the form of sinple and medius-
scale microcircuits (SHIS) for creating microelectronic and radioelectronic equip-
ment; b) in microcircuits of the new generation -- matrix and microprocessor BIS.
When creating devices on the basis of matrir BIS it is necessary to establish elec-
trical coupling between the base elements of the crystal in accordance with the

66

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

prescribed function for performing final metalisation. When creating microproces-
sor-type devices, along with BIS, series-produced IS and 81418 (most frequently in
the 111. basis) should be used.

Supplement
Brief Explanations for Figures 1-1.

1) TIL-circuits (Figure la, c) are switched from state 1 to state 0 at the output
at X1 I X and“, I I. The rush circuit (figure lb) has three states: 1, 0, and
"off". 'r e "off"-state at X - l is necessary for transmitting signals to the
coupon main line bus from at er Tush-circuits combined with the given circuit with
respect to the output.

2) ESL-circuits (Figure 2a, b) operate when the current I is switched from the
transistor T0 to the intonation transistor ('11 or 2;) under the effect of the
signal x1 I l or x2 - 1. In the basic ESL-circuit (Figure 2a), two nicrocircuits
are connected to the cannon load for the logic function "wiring" OR. “381. circuits
(Figure 2b) operate without 31’ in the mode of weal: saturation (8 < 1.1) of the
transistors at E - 2.4 V; it is permissible to include additional logic stages 0p-
crating from one source of current I. EFL-circuits (Figure 2c) in the chain form
a current switch analogous to 1'0, 1'1, (in Figure 2a); the operation speed of EFL is
high because there is no inverter. In the trigger circuit, F I 500 “I: was obtain-
ed. On the basis of an odd number of ESL circuits (Iigure 2a) covered by 008 [ne-
gative feedback), linear amplifiers were obtained with f 3. “P 300 Ulla, Kg I S.

3) IZL~circuits (Figure 3a, b) contain a p-n-p-injecting transistor (To) and an
n-p-n-inverting transistor (T1) combined with it; 12!. is switched from state 1 to
state 0 at the output at X1 I X7_-’-... I 1, when the injection current flows into
the base region 'r , saturating it. The logic function "wiring" A'ID does not require
any increase in the number of transistors when the number of inputs is increased.
Modifications of 12!. with Schottky diodes at the input (Figure 3b) and at the out-
put have a higher operation speed. The injection-field logic IPl. (Figure 3c) is
based on the modulation of the width of the vertical channel Tl under the effect
of the injection current ll controlled by the input signals; at X Ixz‘... I x. I
l, the current is switched to T1 and shifts the p-n-junction in t e forward direc-
tion, opening the channel in such a way that signal Y I 0 forms at the drain.

lo) KMDP-circuits (Figure lob, c) contain resistorless keys using mtually supple-
menting transistors 1‘1, 1'3 (1‘2, 1:4); for the Aim-M circuit, at X1 I x; I ... Km
- 1, 1'1 and T2 switch on along the gate, and 1'3 and 1", close in such a we that
current ICT 25 0, and signal Y I 0. Residual voltage U°BHX4 1 mV (in {1] this

[Text] The authors present the basic principles of using digital techniques in some
areas of coumunication. Individual chapters treat analog-digital conversion, basic
characteristics of digital transmission systems and digital techniques used in set-
ellite communication systems. Special attention is given to the use of digital tech-
niques in telephone stations and communication networks, as wall as to the problems
of data transmission. The book was written jointly with Czech specialists.

This book is intended for engineers and technicians engaged in the development and
operation of digital communication systems.

Authors' Foreword

Up to the present time, low-frequency technique was used in rural communication net-
works and a high-frequency technique was used in the networks of higher levels. This
structure was connected primarily with the transmission of voice signals -- telephone
conversations.

With the increasing volume of the transmitted information of nonvoice signals and
the development of digital techniques, there arose the desire to use these princi-
ples and solutions in transmission and switching systems. It is natural that this
desire meant for some communication sectors (for example, techniques of telephone
stations) to give up the use of electromechanical switchboards.

0n the basis of the digital techniques, there developed an independent area of digi-
tal transmission for multiple use of communication lines. Digital techniques start-
ed being used gradually for switching at telephone stations. Classical methods of
digital-analog conversion, IKH [pulse-code modulation], as well as some other me-
thods, for example, various kinds of delta-conversion, are used. So far, both main

directions of communication, i.e., transmission and switching techniques, arevde-
veloping independently, although identical principles and solutions are used in some

In the future digital technique can lead to further modernization and increased econ-
omy of communication networks due to the integration of the transmitting and switch-
ing equipment in a single complex system. This task is promising and can be realized
at the present time. At the same time, there is a tendency toward the unification

of the telephone, telegraph, and data transmission networks and later image transmds-
sion networks into a single network with the purpose of integrating all communica-
tion services.

The book presents the fundamental principles of the applications of digital techni-
que in communications. Individual chapters deal with the basic characteristics of
the analog, digital-methods of conversion, principles of multichannel digital trans-
mission systems, and the use of digital technique for switching and controlling prom-
ising telephone stationsand communication networks, as well as with the problems of
data transmission through digital channels.

One of the important areas of application of digital technique for transmitting
voice and nonvoice information is communication through artificial earth satellites.

A separate chapter deals with this area of communication.

The size of the book makes it possible to give only basic ideas about digital tech-
nique of communication and to map out further ways of its development. We should
not disregard the tremendous effect of microelectronics on the development of digi-
tnl technique, due to which it was possible in many instances to develop systems
whose principles have been known already for a number of years.

The book is intended for engineers, technicians and scientists engaged in the devel-
opment and operation of digital communication systems and can be useful also to stu-
dents of institutes and teknikums in these areas.

The author: hope that this book will expand the information of the readers about
this area of engineering and will thuL contribute to its further development.

Editor's Foreword

Successful activities of modern human society'age impossible without communication
exchange. Regardless of where people have to work, exchange of cumnunications among
them is the basis of the organization of their activity.

Due to a number of reasons, in the second half of the twentieth century there appear-
ed a necessity of scientific organisation of exchange of communications. One of the
main reasons is the fact that modern production has become so complicated and devel-
oped that, in order to control it, it is necessary to create automatic control sys-
tems using electronic computers (EVE). Formerly, electric communication systems en-
sured the transmission of information between people, but the introduction of EVH
changed the situation in the part of the required types of communication. There
appeared the need in the following types of couummication: "man -- EVH" and "EVM ~-
EVH“. This led to extensive transmission of information in the digital form, which
is adapted the best for its introduction to EVH.

The tendency to using digital methods in the electric communication technique is ex-
plained not only by the wide applications of BVH. Transmission of information in

the digital form has a number of substantial advantages in comparison with its trans-
mission in the analog form. The following are the main advantages:

wider possibilities of combining and processing different types of information con-
verted into the digital form, since it is universal;

higher interference hununity of digital signals;

possibility of the regeneration of digital signals, which makes it possible to ob-
tain high quality of transmission regardless of the length of the line and the num-
ber of intermediate stations;

possibility of the isolation, input and switching of information at intermediate
stations in the digital form without any loss of quality;

stability of the parameters of channels formed with the aid of digital systems and
the absence of the effect of overloading, which improves the quality of transmission
in a switched communication network;

possibility of using standard, reliable and inexpensive integrated circuits, which
decreases considerably the cost of the switching and multiplexing systems which are
determining in the cost of the entire system;

greater effectiveness of the transmission of telegraphic signals and data signals
in comparison with their transmission through analog channels.

It should be added that modern communication systems use such means of transmission
as waveguide and optical-fiber communication lines, through which the transmission
of signals can be the most optimal in the digital form.

The flow of digital information through communication systems is growing progres-
sively. At the same time, the flow of analog information is also growing. In this

connection, several ways are possible for designing systems intended for transmitting
both analog and digital information flows.

The first path is the use of universal tracks and channels formed by standard sys-
tems with frequency division of channels. In this case, analog signals are trans-
mitted by the usual method without additional conversion; digital information is
transmitted through the same tracks equipped with adaptive harmonic correctors.

The second way is to transmit the conversion of all types of analog systems into di-
gital signals and their transmissions through channels of wide-band systems in con-
junction with digital information obtained directly from data transmission facilities.

The third way of constructing digital systems provides for a general nature of con-
verting analog information into digital information in the communication sources
themselves (for example, in a telephone set). In such a system, only switching,
unification and division of digital information is realised.

Naturally, the first path was used first when it was necessary to transmit large
flows of digital information. But this path was relatively low-effective. In this

69

connection, at the present time the development of communication systems progresses
according to the second path. Therefore, books treating the basic principles of
transmitting and switching digital signals are very important.

The publication of the book "Digital Techniques in Communications" written jointly
by Soviet and Czechoslovak specialists is very timely. E. Prager is known to
Soviet specialists as one of the authors of the book "Electronic Telephone Stations"
which was translated and published by the publishing house “Svyas'” in 1976.

So far, speech analog information is the initial information in most cases. When it
is transmitted through digital channels, it must be converted into a digital form;
inverse conversion is performed during reception. Here, an important role is played
by analog-digital converters of various types. Problems of such conversion in appli-
cation to speech signals, namely IKH [pulse-code modulation] conversion and delta-
conversion are treated in Chapter 1 of the book.

In most cases digital channels are used for multichannel transmission of messages.

In this case. time consolidation and separation of signals is used. These problems
are also examined in Chapter 1. Apart from speech signals, digital channels are used
for transmitting other analog information, such as radio broadcasting signals and
wide-band signals of equipment with frequency division of channels. Problems of the
transmission of such signals, as well as data signals, are discussed in Chapter 2.
Chapter 3 deals with general principles of designing equipment with IKM and delta-
modulation. The hierarchy of digital systems is discussed in Chapter 5. Communica-
tion lines for transmitting digital signals, namely cable, radio-relay, waveguide
and optical fiber lines, are touched upon in Chapter 5 which is descriptive in na-
ture. Readers wishing to familiarise themselves with these problems in more detail
should refer to the appropriate literature.

A specific case of multichannel transmission of information in the digital form oc-
curs in satellite communication systems. The satellite retransmitter is used by all
earth stations of a given satellite communication system. Therefore, there arises
the problem of multistation access, i.e., selection of a transmission and retrans-
mission method ensuring a minimum of interstation interference and the highest effec-
tiveness of the system as a whole. An important characteristic of the digital satel-
lite communication system is its interference immunity at great lengths of intervals
and limited power resources aboard the satellite. Interference immunity can be in-
creased, for example, by using an interference-proof coding. All these problems, as
well as the methods of linking ground and satellite commmmication lines are discus-
sed in Chapter 6.

The remaining chapters of the book (7-10) deal with the switching of digital signals.
Apart for the principles of switching, special attention is given to program con-
trol (including centralized control) of switching processes with the aid of control-
ling computers. These problems arc examined with consideration for the creation of
integrated digital systems and communication networks. Digital methods of transmit-
ting control and interaction signals, as well as problems of transmitting and switch-

ing data signals, are also touched upon.

Comprehensiveness and descriptiveness are the distinctive characteristics of this
book. It touches upon almost all problems of the applications of the digital

technique in information transmission systems. In this respect, this book is, to a
certain degree, a reader and is very useful for acquiring a general knowledge of the
problems of digital commication systems.

[Text] Annotation

In this handbook methods are discussed for calculation of inductance coils
with and without magnetic circuits, which are used during construction of
elements of automatic, electrical and radioelectronica equipment. The
handbook material is presented in the form of mathematical models, nomograms

and tables. The handbook is designed for engineer-technical workers dealing
with the development of radio electronic and electrical equipment.

Foreword

Inductance coils are widely used in different kinds of engineering devices
and are typified by parameters which are determined by the electromagnetic
properties of the magnetic conductors, the conditions of their magnetiza-
tion. the mutual location of the coil turns. etc.

Consideration of a large number of factors, on which these parameters
depend, leads to complex calculated models.

Hhen using manual methods for calculating the parameters of inductance coils
[1] their calculated models must be somewhat simplified. Simplification of
the models naturally reduces the calculation accuracy and limits the area

of application of the models.

Accuracy of parameter calculation can be improved and thus the area of their
application can be expanded if one uses a computer for all of the computations
thereby preserving the rigorouaness of the calculated models.

The purpose of this book is to set forth the general methods for construct-
ing rigorous calculated models of inductance coils without magnetic circuits
and with magnetic circuits, and also a mathematical description of the models
of their different designs.

Reference material in the form of nomograms and tables are given in order
to aid in the calculation the parameters of the most popular design.

Rigorous mathematical descriptions of models and approximate calculation
formulas are given for the calculation of the parameters of other coil
designs. The error rate for estimating parameters from approximate formulas
is 10-40%. The book contains four chapters. Chapter 1 is introductory

and is devoted to determination of the physical meaning of the parameters
and to foraulstiona of the general mathematical methods of their
calculation.

chapter 2 and 3 contain reference material on calculation of internal and
mutual inductances of the more popular kinds of designs of circuits and
coils without magnetic circuits.

Chapter 6 contains reference material on calculation of inductance coils
with magnetic circuits of varying designs: composite, open. and closed.

Chapters 1—3. and also sections h-2-4-6 and b-Sb were written by
M. V. Nentsov, and sections 4-1 and vaa were written by Yu. H. Shamayev.

The list of principal designations matches the basic terminology used in
the book. Moreover. individual designations can be used to define other
concepts which are explained in each situation. Designations of the param-
eters with indices which refer to several monotypical elements are further
designated with the number of the element in parentheses. For example,
h2(1) is the pitch of the winding of turns in the layer of coil 1. All
geometrical dimensions are indicated in this book by lower case letters,
and the dimensions in relative units corresponding to them are indicated

by matching upper case letters.

[Text] This book describes the designs of the equipment used most widely in semi-
conductor production and gives its basic specifications, formulates the requirements
for the equipment, and gives practical recommendations for effective checking of the
condition of the main types of equipment. It describes the principles of full mech-
anization and automation in the modern semiconductor industry. The most character-
istic lines and production systems are described.

This book is intended for engineers and scientists connected with the production and
application of semiconductor devices and integrated microcircuits.

Foreword

Due to the rapid growth of the output of discrete semiconductor instruments and in-
tegrated microcircuits, one of the main tasks of this industry is continuous improve-
ment of technological and measuring equipment and full mechanization end automation
of lines and systems as the main basis for their mass production. In connection with
the qualitative changes which occurred in production technology of devices in recent
years, there is an acute need in literature treating the equipment for semiconductor
production.

This book describes the most typical domestic and foreign equipment used in the pro-
duction of semiconductor devices. Primary attention is given to the technological
equipment for mass-production-type transistors and semiconductor integrated micro-
circuits which are developed on the basis of planer technology.

The last three chapters of the book treat fully mechanized lines and systems for mass
production of semiconductor devices and integrated microcircuits. They explain cer-

tain general problems of full automation and mechanization of semiconductor produc-
tion, including the problems of systemic approach and optimisation of the main

parameters of fully mechanized lines and systems in designing automated production
processes, as well as problems of automation of transportation between operations
and control of technological processes and production of semiconductor devices.

It is assumed that the reader of this book is familiar with the fundamentals of the
technology of semiconductor production. Therefore, the problems of technology are
not treated in the book and are touched upon only in some instances in connection
with the necessity to explain the operating principles in more detail or structural
characteristics of the described equipment.

In the opinion of the authors, this book will be useful to designers of equipment,
production engineers and other workers of the semiconductor industry connected with
its operation, as well as students of vuses and tekhnikums of these specialties.

Introduction

The increased capacity and output of industrial installations and units, their
intensified operating modes, and the appearance of technological processes which
are new in principle and are fairly complex require broader development, and intro-
duction in various branches of the national economy, of automated control systems
based on the integrated electrical automation technical equipment which is included
in the State System of Industrial Instruments and Means of Automation.

The current stage of development of automated process control systems is character-
ized oy heightened requirements and functional support and viability of technical
equipment at all levels of application in hierarchically structured automatic
process control systems. These requirements make it necessary to improve operating
reliability significantly and to expand the functional capabilities of primarily
those devices uhidaare used to organize automated process regulation systems. The
efficiency of various automated process control systems depends to a significant
degree upon the sophistication of the regulation equipment used at the middle and
bottom levels of their multilevel structure.

Electrical analog regulating devices comprise a significant group of technical
automation devices which are included in these systems. The use of analog elec-

trical regulating devices in automatic regulation systems makes it possible to
improve significantly the quality of automatic control, to increase the speed and
precision of technological processes and to improve the technical-economic

indicators of the regulation equipment as a whole. Analysis of the develop-

ment of domestic and foreign electrical general-purpose instrument systems for
automatic monitoring, regulation and control of technological processes shows that
the following two types of regulation devices are most widely used in the USSR:
regulation devices which produce a dc signal for control purposes. and those with

a pulsed output signal whose parameters correspond to COST 21693-76. The first of
these types of regulation devices is designed to operate together with proportional
actuating mechanisms and positioners, while the second is to be used with integrat-
ing actuating mechanisms. Electrical actuating mechaniese with output element
(shaft, rod) which moves at a constant speed are used most widely as integrating
actuating mechanisms.

Thanks to the changeover to a new microelectronic component base, there has now
been significant progress in the area of electronic regulator building. Use of
integrated circuits has required the use of new technical treatments in developing
analog regulating devices. and has often made it possible to use treatsente which
were technically and economically unjustifiable when discrete radio components were
used.

Microelectronic analog regulating devices are characterised by good static. dynamic
and metrological parameters; they are convenient and reliable in operation, the
artistic and aesthetic layout of front panels and operating controls is modern.

and the devices are multifunctional in terms of the type of operations executed.
There are modifications of analog regulating devices which are designed to operate
jointly with electronic computers and controllers in the so-called supervisory

and direct digital control modes (as a "hot" reserve element).

Regardless of the increasing use of microprocessor equipment and digital controllers
in the area of process automation, the role of electrical analog regulation devices
in modern automatic process control systems is not lessening; rather, it is increas-
ing because these devices are gaining new functional capabilities. their operating
characteristics are improving, their circuitry and design treatments are being
simplified along with a significant increase in reliability through the use of
specialized microasaemblies and solid-state operational amplifier matrices.

while the main area of application of computers is comprised of multi-loop and
multi-level hierarchical automatic process control systems with centralized control.
and that of microprocessor devices and multichannel digital regulators based on them
is comprised of automatic process control systems with distributed control. we should
expect the future use of multifunctional analog electrical regulation devices,
chiefly in decentralized automatic control and regulation systems, and in local
automatic process regulation systems in which these regulation devices are now

used most extensively.

The development of automatic control and regulation technology is thus creating the
necessary prerequisites for further growth in the automation of production pro-
cesses and improving the quality of production.

In this connection. it becomes specially important to study the fundamentals of the
theory and principles of designing technical equipment for regulating technological
processes.

existing method monitors not the value of the contact pressure, but the frictional
force in the contacts, and should be replaced with a method ensuring direct measure-
ment of the contact pressure.

[Text] The author gives the classification of incoherent optoelectronic devices and
determines the optimal system of their parameters. he examines methods of measuring
the parameters and the designing principles of information and measuring complexes
controlled by electronic computers. Metrological aids for the designing and manufac-
turing of incoherent optoelectronic devices are discussed. Scientific principles of
methods for metrological facilities of enterprises are developed.

The book is intended for specialists working in various areas of radio electronics.
as well as for undergraduate and graduate students specialising in this area.

Foreword

Resolutions of the 26th CPSU Congress, as well as decisions of the party and govern-
ment, defined the raising of production effectiveness as the main task and indicated
the necessity of systematic improvement of the quality of production and improvement
of the production control system.

In order to solve this complex problem, it is necessary to have reliable information
on the quality of initial materials, the state of technological process, and param-
eters of finished products. Measurements are the main source of such information

at all stages of production. By achieving the necessary level of accuracy and reli-
ability of measurements during the stages when the quality of the product is formed
(initial materials, technolgical processes) it is possible to switch from monitor-
ing the quality of finished products to quality control and, consequently, to con-
duct the production process on a profitable basis.

in recent years, the problem of obtaining reliable results of measurements of param-
eters in semiconductor electronics has become quite acute. This was caused by a
rapid growth of the requirements for the accuracy of measurements, appearance of new

129

FOI¢0FFKJAI.USE(NVLY

parameters, and the necessity of automated measurements in organising mass produc-
tion of electronic engineering products (IBT).

Since IET are articles supplied to enterprises of all sectors of the national econ-
omy producing and operating various instruments, the problem of ensuring identical
measurement of parameters in the manufacturing of lET by the manufacturer and dur-
ing the receipt control by the consumer is also of paramount importance.

The requirements of ensuring a steady improvement in the accuracy of measurements

of the parameters and uniformity of their measurement, particularly in the absence
of standardised methoa d measuring new types of m for promising radio electronic
systemsand complexes, are not always met. Some theoretical problems of metrological
aids for developing and manufacturing IET have not been worked out thoroughly.

The intensive and, to a considerable extent, independent development of individual
branches of industry led to the appearance of discordances of some terms, normalised
metrological characteristics, and sometimes even to discordances of standards.

Some problems of metrological means have not been included in the State System for
Standardization of Measurements (681) but are distributed aver other systems. This
does not contribute to the solving of modern problems of improving the quality of
products, growth of the effectiveness of mass production of IET, as well as to the
improvement of the technical and operational characteristics of electronic devices
and systems in which they are used.

There are a number of published articles, but no basic works treating the measure-
ment of the parameters and metrological means for developing and manufacturing inco-
herent optoelectronic devices. The purpose of this book is to fill this gap to some
extent and make it possible for the reader not only to obtain information on indivi-
dual special problems, but also to see the problem as a whole: along with detailed
examination of the parameters, methods and means of their measurement, to familiar-
ize oneself with the concept and ideas introduced by optics into electronics, pros-
pects for the development of instruments of incoherent optoelectronics, and areas of
their applications.

Purposeful examination of a broad range of new problems treated in the book made it
necessary to examine them in an integrated manner: the first chapter explains the
possibilities of incoherent optoelectronics ensuring the attainment of maximum char-
acteristics of systems of radio electronics and instrument-building, gives the clas-
sification of devices and their terminology, and examines principles of the develop-
ment of an optimal system of parameters. Subsequent chapters present physical
principles of the operation of incoherent optoelectronic devices, areas of their ap-
plications, systems of parameters and methods of their measurement, problems of the
development of working means of measurements with consideration for the necessity

of automated measurements in mass production of instruments.

Special attention is given to the problems of measuring photometric parameters and
metrological facilities, since measuring these parameters in mass production is con-
nected with many technological and designing complexities and the absence of the ap-
propriate level of metrology. whenever necessary, the author analysed the state of
metrological standardization, expanded and refined certain concepts. and concentrated

his attention on unsolved problems.

At the present time, there is a great deal of discord in available literature on in-
coherent optoelectronics vith respect to terminology and classification. The clas-
sification developed by the author divides products of incoherent optoelectronics

by their functional significance and degree of complexity with consideration for the
prospects for their development.

The bibliography given here is not at all complete. For example, there are many
publications on the physical principles of operation of the elements and devices of
optoelectronics and their areas of applications. The author deemed it possible to
do without traditional references, giving only a list of race-mended literature.

The author is deeply grateful to Professor Yu. R. Nosov, doctor of technical sciences
and to Candidates of Technical Sciences A. B. Gittsevich and V. K. Kostomarov for
their suggestions and help in working on the monograph.

The author is also grateful to Professor M. I. Yelinson, doctor of technical sciences,
Professor A. F. Kotyuk, doctor of technical sciences, Professor V. N. Sretenskiy,
doctor of technical sciences, A. V. Iyevskiy, doctor of technical sciences, and V.

P. Dnitriyev, candidate of technical sciences, for their valuable suggestions for
improving the book.

[Text ] Annotation

This book explains the theory and principles of constructing self-calibrating
wideband and selective measuring amplifiers, as all as stabilised alternating
current sources. A classification of self-calibrating neasuring instruaents is
provided. A method is given for analyzing the stability of self-calibrating
measuring instruments. which are nonlinear, non-autonomous. nonstationary auto-
matic control systems described by nonlinear differential equations with variable
coefficients. A time quantization method is proposed for analysing transient
processes. The information characteristics of instruments are determined.

The book is intended for scientific and engineering-technical workers specia-
lizing in the area of information-measurement technology, and for specialists
involved in developing electronic measuring instruments, 40 illustrations.

Foreword

The present stage of development of measurement technology is characterized by
significant conplication of the operating conditions of instruents - the varia-
tion of environmental temperature. pressure, humidity, supply voltage, radiation,
etc., over an extremely vide range. In addition. the requirements for the para-
meters of measurement facilities, primarily accuracy, sensitivity. speed and
reliability. have increased. All of this makes it necessary to complicate the
schematic diagrams of the instruments. The overall trend in the improvement

of electronic instrumentation is to utilize standardised integrated modules.

As a rule. these standard modules have a significant parameter spread and time/
temperature instability. The use of traditional methods to reduce errors -
conpensation circuits, manual calibration - are usually~ineffective because of

a number of familiar shortcomings.

The structural methods which have recently come to be used extensively for re-
ducing additive and'multiplicative errors are most radical. In order to reduce
multiplicative error. instruments are used which have a closed functional diagram
(single- and multi-section); these are linear. stationary and tracking automatic
control systems.

Giving the advantages of these instruments their due. we must not forget their
basic disadvantages: these include the complexity of implementing these circuits
in instruments used to measure nonelectrical quantities. reduced sensitivity due
to considerable negative feedback. expanded paseband of selective devices. etc.

In the author's opinion, the most promising systems for reducing multiplicative
.anrors caused-by slow variation in the parameters of analog circuit elements are
self-calibrating systems with and without fault tracing with continuous and peri-
odic comparison. A number of problems remain unresolved for self-calibrating
instruments (instrtnents in which the principle of self-calibrating measurement
systems is realized).

1. Dynamic analysis. including stability and quality analysis. This problem is
complicated by the fact that self-calibrating instruents are nonautonomous. non-
linear. nonstationary automatic control systems and are described by nonlinear
differential equations with variable coefficients. In the general case, the latter
are expressed through discontinuous functions.

2. Static analysis. which includes investigating the measurement equation and
errors considering their probability-statistical nature.

3. The principles of constructing self-calibrating measuring instruments for
measuring electrical quantities.

This book attempts to solve these problems. The book presents the results of the
author's research in this area at the Institute of Electrodynamics of the Academy
of Sciences of the Ukrainian 333. Wideband and selective amplifiers. as well as
stabilized alternating voltage sources. which are used extensively in instrumen-
tation technology. are used as practical examples. All of the instruaent circuits
presented in the book were proposed with the author's participation. have been
verified in practice; most of them have been introduced to industry. Because of
limited space, the book does not include other examples. particularly self-
calibrating instruments designed for determining magnetic quantities. The book
attempts to systematire self-calibrating instruments in terms of various classic
fication features. The harmonic linearisation method has been developed furthest
for analyzing stability; a time quantization method has been developed for
performance analysis; error analysis is done considering the probability-statistical
and information characteristics of the instruaents. It should be noted that the
use of the principle of self-calibrating systems for automating static multi-
plicative errors comes far from exhausting its capabilities. It is especially ex-
pedient to use this principle to reduce dynamic errors, particularly the additional
dynamic errors which arise when environmental conditions change. In the latter

case. fault-tracing self-calibrating systens with a standard nodel nay be the
only neans for solving this problen.

cathode on the output parameters of a sodified Pierce gun. In the anode cavity of
the gun, a plasma source is installed with whose aid it is possible to correct the
"sagging" of the field in the anode opening due to the compensation of the voluss
charge of the beam by the field of positive ions of the plasma. It is shown that
the consideration of the effect of the thermal spread of the velocities of electrons
leads to the fact that at the output of the gun there are obtained finite values of
such parameters as brightness, specific power of the beam, and some others. Figures

Foreword

Dynamic vide-range saplifiers (WA) are now the most isportant cosponents

in radio-electronic equipment used in various areas of science and technology.
A considerable nuber of publications [itens 1-12 in bibliography on page

11‘] have been devoted to the pecularities of theoretical research for m.
rating sethods and practical inl-sentation. The distinguishing feature of
DHAs, as components of conte-porary radio equipnent. is the wide use of inv-
tegrated nicrocircuits (m). The general tendency toverds conprehensive
nicroninaturieation and a systaa approach during the design of radio-
electronic equip-ant is characterised by the following: using existing

nu. improving circuit engineering and functional capabilities of individual
amplifying stages on the basis of their integration. striving for functionally
couplets assuablies. sub-unite and units [its 2 in bibliography on page 116].
Based on the above, one lust consider circuit engineering and design engineer-
ing perfor-ance capabilities of individual .plifying stages and the

152

POROFI'ICIALUSIONLY
parameters of industrially-produced the when determining methods for con-
structing DHAs and when solving tasks involving assurance of the requisite
indices and stability of amplifier performance under changing operational
conditions.

In iaplementing DHAs. one nust keep in mind their general peculiarity.
This consists in the fact that demands for wide-band and inertia-free
characteristics in an amplifier and the independence of its performance
nodes from changes in the level of the input signals come into conflict
with the need for coordinating the dynamic wide-range of changes in the
level of the input signals with the relatively narrow dynamic range of
output signals. This circumstance is reflected in the selection of cir-
cuit diagrams for individual stages.

In connection with the above, this book examines methods for constructing
aperiodic non-linear DHAs which assure stability in amplitude—frequency
and phase-frequency performance nodes during changes to the level of the
input signal in a large dynamic range.

Based on an analysis of the research results, recommendations are nude
for selecting the most effective circuit engineering solutions.

[Abstract of article by S. I. Podkovyrin and Ye. It. Starovoytova]

[Text] This article exasines the possibilities of using quasioptical planar
elements in microwave technology and the singularities of their analysis and

design. The dispersion properties of planar lenses and prisms are analyzed.
It is shown that by selecting the paraneters appropriately it is possible to
create planar eleaents whose characteristics have null dispersion in a defined
frequency region, or even over a wide frequency band. It is thus possible

to eliminate chromatic aberration of planar lenses.

ity of regulating current in one sampling interval of the rectifying converter in
the absence of limitations.

[Text] As work developed in the area of high-speed surface transportation
equipped with linear engines. the tsrninal effect in the linear induction
engine [1.18] was defined as one of the factors which nest greatly influenced
the engine's efficiency as a whole.

In this nonograph, the. status of this issue in our literature and in foreign
literature is reflected. The theory of the tsrninal effect is examined in
approximating the snell nonnagnetic gap (one-dinensional theory). A two-
dinensional theory has been developed for solving engineering tasks which
exceed the capabilities of this approximation. This theory is based on a
device using Fourier series and integrals and is intended to describe equip-
nent with a nonmagnetic gap and working nediun of any thickness. It is
also intended to adequately account for dispersion of a field. investigate
the capabilities of conpensating for the terninal effect and other problem.
whose enanination in a one-dinensional approximtion gives unsatisfactory
results. The linitations in applying this theory are indicated.

Editor 's Foreword

It would seen that A. Ya. Vilnitis and M. S. Drits' nonograph. offered to
the reader, is devoted to a narrow problen in the theory of linear induction
(asynchronous) electric nachinsry—the so-callsd tereinal effect. This

tern designates the aggregate of phenonsna connected with the final length
of a napetic circuit and a nachine's coil area. This aggregate leads. in
the final analysis, to wave distortion in a travelling nagnetic and electri-
cal field and has a substantive inpsct. in a nunber cages. on the perfornsnce

of equip-ent.

In fact, the terminal effect is one of the central and most complex problems
in the theory of linear electric machinery. Actually, a considerable number
of works, which continue to increase even now, have been devoted to this
problem. Nevertheless, a final solution to the problem has still not taken
shape.

A famous Soviet scientist, Professor A. I. Vol’dek, is the founder of the
systematic study of the terminal effect. He developed the one-dimensional
theory, the simplest and most obvious theory, which permits one to quanti-
tatively express and evaluate the basic rules of the terainal effect.

A. I. Vol'dek was also one of the first to develop proposals for compensating
for the negative influence of the terminal effect.

In recent years, many works have been published which are devoted to the
two-dimensional and three-dimensional study of the terminal effect. However,
different approaches to solving this task on the pert of various authors,

the immense number of results and unwieldly computations do not always

allow one to make effective use of the results of this research.

In connection with increased attention to planning and practical use of
linear induction machinery (including inductirn pumps for general works
about the terminal effect. Previously-published summary works about this
problem have become obsolete now. In this reagrd. one must welcome the
appearance of A. Ya. Vilnitis and M. S. Drits' book. The authors' goal is
to systematically and physically set forth, in a strict manner, the basic
problems and consequences of the terminal effect. The book begins with a
general survey of the status of the problem, in which the authors endeavored
to evaluate existing trends in developing the theory of the terminal effect.
The one-dimensional theory is further examined. In doing this, the authors
take the approach indicated by A. I. Vol'dek. However, they do not simply
provide a review of A. I. Vol'dek's works, but systematically study this
problem while devoting proper attention to strictness in formulating the
problem and the methods of resolving it. In so doing. they obtain new
results and provide an interpretation of them. Graphically displaying the
limitation of the one-dimensional theory, the authors proceed further in
researching the two-dimensional theory and obtain additional data.

Of course, this hook, offered to the reader, does not nearly settle the
problems of the terminal effect in its various aspects. Nonetheless, I

think that the reader who is interested in questions of developing a thoery
of linear induction machines and their practical use in resolving engineering
tasks, will find much that is useful in this book.

One of the book's authors, candidate of technical sciences A. Ya. Vilnitis,
is already well-known to many readers, due to his works on the theory on
induction pumps. He took the initiative in putting this book together

and wrote the basic part of the monograph. H. S. Drits did all the basic
computations in the hook and wrote two paragraphs in the final chapter.

[Text] ANNOTATION

This collection of works is devoted to an urgent problem in semiconductor physics:

recombination processes at high excitation levels. In the first article the author
describes a project in which he investigated the processes of interzonal recombina-

tion in semiconductors that are used extensively in electronics, such as silicon and
germanium, as well as in indium arsenide and tellurium. At high excitation levels,
the dominant process in these semiconductors is interzonal Auger recombination. In
the second article the author presents the results of investigations of the process-
es of radiative recombination in undoped crystals of silicon, telluride and cadmium
selenide and the transition of exciton states in these semiconductors into electron-

hold states. He also studies the induced emission of light by undoped rectizonal
semiconductors.

In this collection there is also a bibliographic list of works written by the em-
ployess of PIAN [Physics Institute imeni P.N. Lebedev] from 1962 to 1979.

This publication is designed for scientific workers and graduate students working in
the field of semiconductor physics. and can also be useful to students in higher
courses in vuz's who are studying semiconductor physics.

INTERZONAL RBCMINATION PROCESSES IN SMNNDUCTORS AT HIGH EXCITATION LEVELS
[Abstract of Article by Galkin, G.N.]

[Text] The uuthor develops a method for identifying interzonal reconbination pro-
cesses that is based on an analysis of the dependence of the concentration of excess
charge carriers at high excitation levels and the dependence of the intensity of the
recoubination radiation, as well as its quantu- output, on the rate of charge carri-
er generation. He investigates interzonal recoubination processes and determines
the coefficient of intersonal Auger recombination for silicon and germanium, which
are widely used in semiconductor electronics and are characterized by indirect
interzonal transitions, as well as for indium arsenide and telluriue, which are
semiconductors with zone structures characterized by direct intermal transitions.
lie also determines the coefficient of intersonal radiative recombination for sili-
con, germanium and indium arsenide. Figures 39; references 178.

EXCITONS IN SHICCNDUCTING CRYSTALS AT HIGH EXCI‘I'ATION LEVELS
[Abstract of article by Nolle, B.L.]

[Text] The author investigates nonequilibrium processes (with special emphasis on
luminescence) in undoped semiconductors under strong excitation by an electron beam,
when the relaxation of the excitation is determined by the intrinsic properties of

the crystal lattice's electron subsystem, which is coupled with the exciton states.
In this case, he establishes that recombination of the excess current carriers is

determined by the excitons and the processes involved in their interaction, while
the internal quantum efficiency of the intrinsic luminescence caused by the excitons
is close to unity in direct-zone semiconductors. he also shows that for superhigh
concentrations of excitons, when there is a substantial overlap of their wave func-

tions. the exciton states are converted into electron-hole plasma states because of
their collective interactions. At such concentrations, in direct-zone semi-

conductors there occurs induced radiation with an external quantum efficiency that
is close to unity. Therefore, pure semiconductors can be used as light sources in
(for example) lasers. Figures 25; references 75.

COMMUNICATIONS DURING 111'}! FIVE-YEAR PLAN
Moscow RADIOTBKBNIKA in Russian Vol 36. No 11, Nov 81 pp h-S
[Article by Yu. 3. Zubarev, USSR deputy minister of comications]

[Text] The 64th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution has now
passed. During this year. the entire country has lived under the influence of
the 26th Congress of the Can-unis: Party of the Soviet Union. which smarized the
results of the 10th Five-Year Plan and adopted national development plans for

the 11th Five-Year Plan. Major tasks have been placed before Soviet Science

in terms of accelerating scientific-technical progress and improving the

welfare of the Soviet people; specific tasks have been defined for individual
branches.

Under the gun", ace of the directives of the 25th CPSU Congress, comunications
workers achieved major successes during the 10th Five-Year Plan: they fulfillled
assign-ents with respect to the scat inportant technical-economic indicators, they
improved the efficiency and quality of operation of comnications facilities, and
fulfilled and overfulfilled assignments for the developnent of-technical faci-
lities. A significant step was Iade in creating nationwide Unified Automated
Comunications System (YeASS). The extent of long-distance telephone channels
increased in 1980 by more than a factor of 1.9 over 1975, and a number of critical
cable and radio relay links were put into operation, including a multichannel
radio relay link along the Baykal-Anur Rain Railroad Line.

Thanks to the expansion of the network of comunications channels and construc-
tion of longv-distance telephone exchanges. the level of automation of long
distance telephone communications, to “rich more than 601 of city telephone sub-
scribers now have access, has increased. Host rayon centers have automatic
telephone comnication with their oblast centers. The assigrment for the
development of telephone cousunications in cities and rural areas was overful-
filled: the number of network subscribers increased by about 6 million. The

schedule. This method in contrast to delivering newspaper plates by air. has
accelerated the printing of newspapers at remote locations and made it inde-
pendent of weather. thus speeding their delivery to readers. For example. the

260

ms OFFICIAL WE ONLY
newspaper mm is now delivered to 901 of subscribers on the day it is pub-
lished. Prototype message switching centers (TsKs-T) have been put into opera-
ion. The indicators for bringing channel switching capacities of the Nationwide
Data Transmission Network (OGSPD) and telegraph network have been overfulfilled.
and the subscriber telegraph and Telex network have been expanded. The develop-
ment of radio broadcast and television stations has made it possible to provide
the first radio broadcast progrn to the entire country, and the second program
to 801 of the country; territory containing 861 of the country's population is
covered by television broadcast. The entire television transmitting network
provides color transmission, and the network which feeds central television pro-
grams via the new 'Raduga", "Bkran" and ”Gorizont" co-nunications satellites has
been expanded significantly. The wire broadcast network continued its develop-
ment, with over 80 million wired-radio outlets in place by the end of the Five-
Year Plan, including 40 million three-program outlets. A significant amount

of work has been done to develop postal enterprises and enterprises of Scyuzpechat':
a large number of new post offices and conunications departments have been put
into operation, 108 junction enterprises have been mechanized, and 991 of city
delivery sections have been switched over to mechanized delivery.

The need for accelerating the scientific and technical progress of all branches "
of the economy stands out in the resolutions of the 26th Congress. With respect

to camaunications, this is especially emphasized on the part of forming the
national unified automated connunications system. During the 10th Five-Year Plan,
the USSR Ministry of Coununications together with the Ministry of Industrial
Communications Facilities and the Ministry of the Blectrotechnical Industry
accomplished a great deal of work in creating new technical cmunications
facilities which will provide the basis for further development of conunica-

tions during the llth Five-Year Plan.

In order to develop the primary backbone communications network, high-capacity
coaxial cable transmission systems have been created: the K-l920—P, which trans-
mits. over a normal cable (2.6/9.4m) with four type m-a tubes. 3860 voice-
grsde channels; and the K-3600 system which permits groups of up to 17.500
channels to be accomodated on a type “43-8/6 cable. The lo and 6 0H: KURS radio
relay equipment allows up to 720-1300 or more telephone channels to be organized
over a to 6 working trunks, as well as television transmission. The anu-ao.
"Gruppa", "Orbits-RV", "Ekran". "Hoskva" and other geostationary satellites,
which carry television, telephone, radio broadcast and newapaper column channels,
have been developed for the backbone system. The 'Molniya" system, which trans-
mits via satellites in high elliptical orbit, which makes it possible to trans-
mit programs and maintain telephone commnications with high-latitude locations
in the country, is still in operation.

Beside the previously developed K-300. lt-120 and K-60 analog comnications
systems, intra-oblast primary networks are making extensive use of the newly

created 1101-120 time-multiplexed systeas for a standard balanced cable (to re-
place or augment the K-60) and the Ila-480, which uses a small coaxial cable

(1.2/6.6 n), which can carry digital signals at 8.458 and 36.368 “bps (120

and 680 telephone channels. respectively). This equipment has undergone testing
on specially built experimental communications links. Since the testing indi-
cated satisfactory results of operating the new com-unications sytems, they

have been recommended for industrial production. Radio relay equipment opera-
ting in the 2 and 8 CH: range has been created for these systems which can carry
300 voice grade channelsor television channels in the was trunk. and "Oblast'"

equipment for telephone communication.

New digital xxx-12 (soon to be IKE-15), IKM-30, "Zoos", and IKE-120 (which saves
significant amounts of cable and copper) are in extensive use for local, city

and urban telephone networks. Timeqnultiplexed radio relay link equipment will
be introduced - the "Elektronika-llTs" which operates in the 11 OH; range and

has a 8.668 prs pcm multiplexing system. This system is now being tested on
an experimental link.

Switching equipment is an important component of secondary communications
networks. During the llth Five-Year Plan, new quasielectronic stations which were
developed late in the 10th Fiveerar Plan and have been put into production, will
be put into operation along with the already well-developed K 50/200 and 100/2000,
ATSK-U and ANTS cross’bar switching equipment already in use in all branches of ‘
communications (rural. rayon. city and long distance). This includes the "Kvarts"
exchanges for city and long distance communications. and the "Istok" for rural

and rayon networks.

Channel switching equipment in directvdialing. subscriber telegraph and data trans-
mission systems will continue to be introduced into telephone communications.

In addition, a message switching system — a new highly efficient telegraph com.
munications system -will also be introduced more extensively. The first years

of operation have already affirmed its high technical and operational indicators.
The new "Kurok" electronic telegraph switching exchange, which is expected to

be put into operation by the end of the Five-Year Plan, is also under develop-
ment. Telegraph equipment is being improved significantly: the development and
assimilation of SO and 100 baud electromechanical alphanumeric teletype machines is
reaching completion. The use of ink-type facsimile machines ("Shtrikh") will be
developed further. The development of radio broadcast and improvement of its
quality will occur primarily on the basis of existing technical facilities. as

well as re-equiping existing stations. In order to develop television networks.

a group of high performance remote-controlled unattended transmitters has been
created: the ”ll‘men'-2“, the ATRS-S/l. television relays, etc.

The development of all communications branches during the 11th Five-Year Plan
will thus occur to a significant extent on the basis of new technology. In
addition. besides introducing new facilities which have already been created. it
remains to develop and create new, more sophisticated communications technology.
The main tasks in this area are determined by a goal-oriented integrated pro-
gram which provides for the creation of the next generation of coaxial cable
systems - the K-lOBOO frequency multiplexed system, the IKE-1920 time-multiplexed

262

system, as well as mastery of the production of TIN-680 equipment. An im-
portant direction for technical progress in the area of developing transmission
systems is the creation of a fiber.optic communications system. Experimental
optical links carrying digital streams at 2.068 and 8.648 prs which were created
during the 10th Five-Year Plan have indicated the applicability in principle of
the components and optical cables which have been developed. During the 11th
Five—Year Plan. fundamental problems of creating equipment and cables for oper-
ational fiber optic links must be resolved so that they can be introduced ex-
tensively by the end of this. and the beginning of the 12th Five-Year Plan.

The integrated program defines tasks of developing and producing equipment, as
well as a number of indicators regarding the volume of introduction. which in-
poses definite obligations for the construction of new communications facilities
on the part of introducing new technology.

work is underway to create the new generation of "Blektronika-svyaz'" radio relay
equipment for oblast communication links in all frequency ranges allocated for
those purposes. The development is being done on the basis of the latest
achievements of domestic radio electronics, microminiaturisation and stripline
technology. It is expected that these will be introduced extensively by the

end of this Five-Year Plan.

The tasks imposed by the 26th CPSU Congress are grandiose. Soviet communicators,
recognizing the responsibility they bear for the further development and per-
fection of communications facilities and systems and their role in managing the
national economy, will apply all of their efforts and knowledge in order to
fulfill honorably the plans of the party and of the people.
