[Article by V. P. Lyebskh from book "PlOYEKT-Yes Speciel Pecilities for Systen
Design end Sinuletion", editor-in-chief Acedeuicien V. H. Glushkov, Institute of
Cybernetics, WSSR Acedeny of Sciences, 550 copies, 107 pegee]

[Text] A greet deel of tine is expended on progre-Iing fecilities enebling inter-
ection between the designer end computer-sided design [CAD] syetse. And the com-
plex progrelns ere compiled fro. nodules differing little from eech other in func-
tionel purpose, but very bulky in size. To eneble interection between e CAD system
end s periphsrsl processor, one hes to either supplement the progre-sing lenguege
for the CAD softwere, or construct specielized eoftwsre for the peripherel proces-
sor. Direct epplicetion of e specielized processor with e sieple input lenguege
requires e greet deel of effort to prepere the dete end ccnpile the control pro-
grees. For this purpose, it is expedient to use high-throughput computers thet, in
eddition to reducing progru-ing tine. pereit reducing the umber of errors in pro-
grens end performing debugging with powerful end conw nisnt fecilities. In terms
of both herdwere end softwere. the power of peripherel device fecilities is smell
if they ere oriented toe brosd cless of problems. But if they ere nerrowly speci-
slized, then it is possible to echieve s high level of the progressing lengusge or
instrumentel fecilities in some clsss of problems. but switching to enother cless
of problems requires e greet deel of effort.

Described in this work is en epproech to constructing softwere for the specielized
KSR-lolOO computer thet is e continuetion of the effort to develop fecilities for
interfecing the engineering design stegs end the stege of menufecturing electronic
circuits [1]. The specielized use-4100 computer is used to control en electron-ion
been in lsying out the petterns on crystel with the electronic-ionic technology

for menufecturing circuits. Circuit descriptions mede in the engineering design
stege ere snelyzed end converted into e control progrsa for the use-4100 by speciel
system fecilities.

‘l'he softwere for this pert of the system is compiled by the following fecilities:

1. Date representetion fecilities in the system ere fecilities for representing
dete in the externel description--pettern descriptions. fecilities in internel
representstionucouponent objects, end dete representstion fecilities to eneble

interection--fielde heving perts thet ere constent end varying in the interection
process.

2. Processing facilities enable assignment of the type of pattern, its placement
in the working field, shifting of the pattern, creating a copy of the pattern,
specification of scales on the horizontal and vertical axes, and compilation of a
complex pattern from parts. They use the universal mechanism of processing--trans-
lation by products, which are specified by using tables, which permits easy recon-
figuration of the tables for different types of patterns. These facilities have
now been implemented in the PlOYEKT-Yes system and adjusted for illustration of
texts. The input program for the specialized KSIPAIOO computer must have the fol—
lowing structure: The first part is the pattern program proper, i.e. a series of
pairs of coordinates of the diagonal points of the rectangles forming the pattern.
Each coordinate is specified by a four digit number with a sign. Plus is the
default sign. Cordinates are separated from each other by a special character that
is accessible to the user only during system setup. Bach rectangle (four coordi-
nates) is separated by another character, also user-accessible only at system setup
time. The second part is a file of displacements of this pattern relative to the
coordinates specified in the first part, if the pattern is used several times in
the drawing. This file starts with the character "A". Following it are the coor-
dinates of the displacements arranged in pairs (on the horizontal and vertical
axes). Displacement coordinate format is the same as in the first pert of the pro-
gram. The characters "AE" must be placed before the last apir of displacements.

If the drawing consists of several different repeated patterns, the program for
this drawing must consist of programs for each pattern written by the method de-
scribed above. The input program for the KSKpélOO is read from perforated tape in
ISO codes. These requirements govern the conditions for the structure of the pro-
cessing program and setup of product tables.

The product table is a two-dimensional array. Arranged in the first dimension are
all the pattern types in the language for description of the patterns encountered
in a class of drawing data. In the current version, this includes the letters in
the Russian alphabet, some of the Latin alphabet letters, the numbers and the
punctuation characters. Arranged in the second dimension of the array are the
programs for the corresponding types of patterns in the KSR-lolOO input language,
i.e. in the internal system language up to recoding into 150 codes. The facilities
for entering and editing product tables are offered by the interactive data prepar-
ation systmn (DSPD) which uses a display terminal. The control program scans the
input text and fills out a file for the drawings, which also consists of a certain
number of two-dimensional arrays. The number of arrays matches the number of
different types of patterns (letters). In the first dimension, if a given type of
pattern is encountered in the input text, the pattern program is written from the
product table, and in the second, the apirs of coordinates for the displacements,
defined according to some algorithm by the control program. "hen the pointer,
under the control of which text reading occurs, scans in the input text a pattern
of a type that had been read earlier, only the second part--the subfile of dis-
plccements--is filled out. when the pointer reads in the input text a special
functional character--end of processing, the control program terminates the process
of filling out the drawing file and begins recoding the contents of it into the ISO
codes. The system offers the user two types of pattern specifications: explicit
(two four-digit numbers) and that computed by a special algorithm. if the patterns
are specified in the form of a series of periodically placed elements. The drawing
scale is specified according to the horizontal and vertical axes when the system is
set up and consists in the linear conversion factors for the corresponding axes of
the coordinates contained in the product tables. Specification of the input text

prepared in advance by using the DSPD interactive data preparation system.

with appropriate adjustment, the software described may be used in all spheres of

RSI-4100 application: for control of ion-bean, electronic-lithograph and other

[Text] hardware end Software of SN Conputera

Development of the hardware and software of the SH-l/SDI-Z systea was oriented
nainly to ASU’I'P's [eutonated control systens for industrial processes] with
continuous types of production. But this systen proved quite satisfactory and
found broad application for doing the nost diverse jobs. Anong these jobs are
control of industrial objects with couples: data processing algorithns.
processing geophysical and oceanographic data, controlling scientific experi-
nsnts and processing their results. testing conplex objects, and so on.

The development of conplexes of the SM-IISH-Z architectural lines contemplates
setting up a progrsn-conpatible series of base conputer couplexes which dif-
fer by productivity, logical and structural capabilities. nearin- storage
volune. and other characteristics.

The Junior nodels of this series are the 88-11! and Ski-2H.

While it has a conparatively snall number of models, the systen lust have a
broad range of productivity, from 200,000 to 20,000,000 short operations per
second. A significant further increase in productivity (to hundreds of nil-
lions and billions of operations per second) for sore or le-ss narrow classes
of problem is eccoeplished by setting up problen-oriented special processors
connected to the base conputer conplex.

The Ski-1H conputer conplexes are a nodernization of the 814-1 coqlex of SN
conputers. They can be used in subsystem for input-output control, for
autonomous control of aggregates and industrial processes, for engineering
calculations. and as built-in control units for couple: instruments in scien-
tific experinent systens.

The 831-1)! is the first computer in the SH family that outputs to the general.
purpose ms system interface. This insures that the Ski-ll! is compatible with

SH-l/SH-Z complexes in term of system and user programs and the assortment
of units connected to the SH-l and 91-2.

The design concepts of the SH-lu allow modification of the characteristics of
complexes by volume of internal memory (0066K words) and read-only memory
(to 16K words). as well as by number and assortment of connected peripherals.

Some procedures of the operating system (processing interrupts. control of
switching a unit into the system) have been transferred to microprogrems, which
increases the productivity of the complexes in real-time system. The system
timer (unit) has been replaced by a microprogram. It is proposed that the re-
mainder of microprogram storage be used for problem-oriented user procedures.

The Ski-2!! control cosputer complexes are modernized Ski-2 SH computer complexes.

In the Ski-2!! the processor and channel for direct access to memory are com-
bined in one module and located in one autonomous block of the complex,

which reduces the number of system bundles by almost one-half and also reduces
the overall dimensions of the SH-ZM control cosputer complex.

The speed of the channel for direct access to memory is almost doubled in the
multiplex regime. Internal and microprogram storage are allocated on inte-
grated microcircuits. which improve the technological suitability for manu-
facture and reliability of the complexes in operation.

The software of the Sit-2H cmlexes is put on magnetic media: minicassettes
and reels of magnetic tape.

The SH-l/SM-Di and SH-Z/SH-ZH complexes can interact with terminals. with one
another. and with Yes [Unified System] computers.

The data transmission hardware of the first and second phase SH computers con-
tains data transmission devices (APO-M's and APD-HPP'e). modems with 82 inter-
face, and also modules specially oriented to use in SH computers; adapters for
interlinking with the 82 interface. modules for interlinking with data trans-

mission devices and telegraph comatmications lines. and high-speed intra-
system modules used over short distances.

Our country's telegraph system makes it possible to use telegraph cos-unications
channels to transmit data in the SDI-l and SH-Z complexes. Por this reason, a
software library was developed for work over telegraph lines based on the
A722-2 modules for interlinking with telegraph lines and the A722-6 telegraph
adapters.

The program modules provide exchange of data between the cmuter cowlex and
teletypes (T-63. T-59, RTA. and others) on the subscriber telegraph system or

in a unipolar or bipolar regime of work on switchable or nonswitchable tele-
graph lines respectively.

These units are a constituent part of the operating aggregated software system
(ASPO) and support the establishment of communications with subscribers to the
telegraph system, exchange of sutoresponses (whether exchange of data with the
given subscriber is permissible in the computing system formulated is tested by
the teletype autoresponse), data transmission (input or output of data), switch-
ing off telegraph communications, translating the international telegraph code
NTK-Z into machine language and vice versa, and system operation during detec-
tion of error situations that occur in the telegraph system.

The full set of software and hardware makes it possible to construct terri-

torially decentralized complexes based on the H—7000 ASVT-H and SH-l/SH-Z SH
computers.

The PS-ZOOO problemporiented computer complex is designed for highly productive
processing of large data arrays. It can be used for efficient performance of
tasks that permit parallel processing of many data flows according to the same
program. The computer complex includes a decision field and control unit.

The largest decision field consists of eight processing units. each of which in
turn consists of eight processor elements with its own internal memory. Data
exchange among processor elements is done by a system of information channels;
data exchange with peripheral units is accomplished through a built-in hardware
channel for direct access to the memory of the processor elements.

The PSI-2000 complex can be used to solve problems in geophysics, meteorology,
and other areas which require processing large data arrays by regular algo-
rithms.

A high-speed special processor built as an external unit interlinked with input-
output channels of system ASVT models has been developed for processing seismic
exploration data. This processor is intended to perform group operations on
arrays. Its high speed results from the use of special computer circuits that
interlink in time several arithmetic, logical, and addressing operations.

The special processor consists of a unit for interlinking with the channel, a
control unit, and a pipeline-type arithmetic unit. It performs the following
operations: convolution of an array with a statement; computing mutual corre-
lationa; multiplying two arrays; multiplying an array by a given number; de-
termining a moving average; determining a moving average module; centering an
array; and, copying data inside the main (internal) memory.

The technical specifications of the processor are as follows: internal memory
capacity - l6 kilobytes; speed in performance of the most complex operations
(correlation and convolution) - 4 million paired multiplication-addition oper-
ations per second; volume of each of the two input data arrays is limited to
2,048 16-bit words.

The Al3S-l microprogrsmmable controller (HPK) is designed for setting up pro-
grammable subcomplexes for input-output, external memory, communication with
the object, programmable terminals, and the like within computing systems based
on SM computer hardware. The HPK envisions connecting control (internal and
read-only) memory with a total capacity of 66 K words to internal interface

up to 66 K words to ms interface lines. and servicing 256 addresses of input—
output unite.

The “PK has a nultilevel systea of interrupts. The word length of nitro-
instructions and data is 16 bits. The systee of nicroinstructions for the HP!
includes operating instructions. the instruction to copy a constant. instruc-
tions for conditional and unconditional branches. and input-out instructions.

The aininun perfornance tins for nicroinstructions is 360 nanoseconds.

The arithmetic-logical unit of the HPK processes two operands in each of 32
assigned arithnetic or 16 logical operations and seven shift operations. The
contents of one of the 16 registers of the high-speed internal nasory is used
as tue first operand, and the contents of the buffer register serve as the
second.

The MP! is controlled autonoenusly.

The systen for preparing nicroprograns for the Al3l-5HPK is designed for necro-
generation, translation, editing, comoaing. and debugging nicroprogrsas on the
'SH-l and Sit-2 8H coaputer comlexes. The system makes it possible to work with
nicroprograns written in absolute or shiftable fornat in the specially de-
veloped machine-oriented MIKROKOD language.

The eystsn includes the following progress: translator from HIKROKOD (first
version. no-disk variant); translator fronHIKROKOD (first version, disk vari-
ant); translator froa HIKROKOD of the MN! (second version): HPK nicroprogran
essenbler; technological progran for obtaining truth tables and‘punched tape
for programsble aicrocircuits; technological progran for obtaining tables re-
corded in the m read-only nemry.

The A7lé-S/l (ant-1) and A7llo-S/2 (Rm-2) multiplex interface dividers (branches)
broaden the capabilities of SH—l and Sit-2 control cowuters for input-output by
increasing the nuaber of 2! interface outputs used to connect peripherals to

the control coaplex. supporting the work of two control cowlexes with col-on
peripherals, and saving peripheral units further from the control cmuter
coupler.

The RIM-l with the RIM-2 expansion nodule pernits connecting in as many as 63
peripheral units. The groups of peripheral units arranged on the basis of the
RIM-l and RTE-2 can be noved as such as three kilometers away from the con—
puter complex.

Freeing the central processor of Sit-2 cowuter coqlexes from the functions of
controlling external neaory is accoapliehed by the 1012-3 external aenory sub-
conlex. The subcoquex is based on a microprograuaable controller and in-
cludes, in addition to the NPR, a read-only nenory with capacity of 6K words;
internal nonory with capacity of 32K words, used to allocate data arrays. buf-

fer control sequences. and load test systems; two A328-6 disk control nodules.
with up to four Yes 5061 nagnetic disk stores connected to each of then; two
A318-7 tape control nodules with up to eight Yes 5012-03 nagnetic tape stores

connected to each of then.

The total capacity of external memory with direct access is 232 megabytes,

while with sequential access it is up to 320 megabytes. The external memory
subcoaplex carries on data exchange between the Ski-2 and storage on ugnetic
disks or tapes. nsrks packages or magnetic disks, and copies data iron tape

to disks. No data exchange operations can be performed sinultaneously when the
external memory subcomplex is in use.

The H-6000. H4000. SH-l. and 85-2 coqauter coqlerss can be used to control a
system consisting of a set of standard digital blocks meeting the CAHAC
standard. Up to seven CAMC crates can be connected to the computing complex
using the A7ll-l9 device to match with the came system.

The device is built on three type B boards (for working with 16-bit information
words) or four boards (working with 26-bit intonation words). which are con-

nected to a 2K interface, interlinked by neans of a bundle. and connected to

the plugs of a type A crate-controller. The last crate cannot be more than 15
meters from the cowuter complex.

The unit occupies three access codes in the 2K interface, and provides ex-
change of 16-bit and 26-bit words through the progran channel and 16-bit words
through the channel for direct access to menory. The H—6000 couple): can only
work through the program channel.

The #6000. 14-7000, SH-l, and Sit-2 coquter coqleus can be used to set up
measuring systems and to automate scientific experiments on the basis of pro-
grauable instruments built in conformity with international standard Inn-688
("Digital Interface for Progre-abls Instrumentation") or the standard adopted
by the International Electrotechnical Coniasion ("Standard Interface Systems
for Program-able Measuring Apparatus"). The instruments are connected to the
cowuter complex by means of en 5711-15 nstching device built on two type B

are connected to one of the instrusnts. Pourtesn instruments can be con-
nected to the coquter cowlex through the matching unit at one time; the maxi-
mum allowable distance from the computer compls: is 15 meters.

lnfomtion is received and transmitted in eight-bit code (without monitoring)
or in seven-bit code (with nnitoring). The rate of data exchange is de-
ternined by the characteristics of the program channel of the processor being
used.

The K-331-3 graphic senitone display is designed for displaying, editing, and
processing couples graphic semitone nonochromatic and multicolored inges.
The display is based on a built-in microprogram controller.

The graphic semitone display generates an image in a point natrix formed of

287 television lines with 320 points on each line. Data about the image of
each point are stored in the internal menory of the display as words eight bits
long (seven bits for the graphic image and one bit for the symbol image).

Among the image processing capabilities provided hy the display are: 256 hues

function along assigned horizontal or vertical lines, counting and displaying
histograss and values of functions at an indicated point. and cowuting the
distance between assigned points.

Printers are widely used to output data iron the coquter. The new printer in-
cluded in the SH cowuter set has several outstanding features: a larger
nunher of printing elasants (18 needles) which makes it possible to improve
the quality of character iornetion and print characters with intricate configura-
tions in one pass; greater speed of printing elenents (1.000 Ila) and their
larger number, which sakes it possible to more than quadruple the productivity
of data registration; and. the possibility of turning the printing head on its
longitudinal axis (inforsstion is printed on two nutually perpendicular coordi-
nates). The printer has nicroprogren control of actuating nechaniens and con-
bines the functions of printer and graph plotter. asking it possible to output
graphic intorntion on two coordinates. The low level of position discreteness
sakes possible continuous and point representation of internation. It is
possible to display the infornation being registered in two colors.

The various requirenents of the systens with respect to the forest or blanks
and functions perforned necessitated developnent of a nutter of character-
synthesizing printers. Thus. the ”21-5 device which eutonstically segnsnta
blanks in the euhconplexas was designed for the ASH-5 uses service system.

The A521-6 device is used in subconplenea built on the basis of micro-
progre-able controllers. This unit permits output of various types of

graphic and alphanumeric intonation to a blank 420 nillineters wide by progran
scans.

The A5214. and 531-10 units can print both alphanumeric and graphic intonation.
The blank is 1020 nillineters wide. In addition, the A-‘S3l-l0 has an alpha-
nunsric keyboard block with independent output to an IRPR interface, which
broadens the opportunities for operator comnicetion with the nechine.

[Excerpt] Development of auto-sted systess for processing experimental data (8080)
based on ninicomuters requires special resources for representing processes
occurring in the system in visual torn. Experimental operation of the Fire system
(1) showed that standard television sets can be used as the basis for the visual
displays.

his work describes a specialised display processor that allows an operator to
interact by way of a television set with a ”Etalon" ninicoqauter system (2). The
specialised display processor (DP) has access to a reserved area of the main memory
having a volume of 12,000 16-bit words (Figure l) [tigures not reproduced]. All
other areas of the snin memory and the (3on [not further identified) are inaccess-
ible to the DP.

The I! musty contains instructions and a data buffer as well as special synchroni-
zation service cells (addresses 4000 and 4001). In distinction from the Pirs
system, in which the second processor is a processor-type resource of the system,
the DP is an external unit-type resource of the system.

1. Structure of the Display Processor

The DP is a nicroprogram-controlled unit operating with three types of memories
and a television set (Figure 2). The television set is an ordinary industrially-
producsd color television set that is connected without any alterations to the

or control unit.

The effective senoryuthat is, the memory reserved for the DP nicroprograms. has
a volume of 1.024 64-bit words with a word access time of 500 nanoseconds.

Special instructions can be used to update this met-cry (only in its entirety),
and its contents predetermine the probles orientation or the display processor.

There is one other form of DP memory which is accessible only to the DP. this is
the sywol generator, which has a volune of 1,024 bytes with a byte access tine of
500 nanoseconds. Small in volume, the effective estuary and the sylbol generator
are internal to the DP, and they are accessible to the first processor only in
special nodes, in which they are menorized as a whole.

The third type of sensory with which the DP works is the Iain usury or, more
accurately, a region of the main beauty with a values of l2,000 16-bit words be-
ginning with the address 400015. This usury is simltaneously accessible to the

first processor and the DP. In this case when addresses larger than 400015 are
interrogated, the first processor has the least priority in picking up the main
memory cycle. '

[Text] The problem of reconciling a nutter of contradictory demands imposed on
the processor must be solved in system processing experimental data obtained tron
natural tests on coqlex objects. On one hand we have high productivity and quick
servicing of high speed peripheral input-output equipment, while on the other hand
we have minimum dinensfons, weight and consmed power on the condition of suffi-
ciently high work reliability. Moreover the ccquter must respond quickly to

change in external conditions, and it must sake the corresponding changes from one
program to another quickly.

To satisfy the speed requirements, the ninicosputer processor is structured
according to the principle of containing instruction processing phases-~that is,
the conveyor principle. The phases of selecting an instruction from the lemry,
modifying the address part of the instruction, exchanging an operand with the
memory and acculmlating an arithn tic-logic operation are carried out in indepen-
dent blocks of the processor (1). '1!) ensure mini-um couputer outlays, the work
of the blocks is controlled synchronously and with nicroprograns.

Let us evaluate the different structural variants of the processor. We designate
the duration of the i-th phase by (a: and assuse that all phases are carried out
in succession. The total duration of an operation would he

It should be noted that the phases of instruction execution are carried out by
different blocks at different speeds.

let us assuse that the main emery of the uinicosputer consists of separate in-
struction mssnry and data memory blocks. The cycle time t!- of the conveyer is set
equal to the longest phase:

tgv-aax {ti}.
- (1)

Usually the time required to coqlete the principal, short arithmetic-logic opera-

tions is shorter than the memory interrogation cycle. let t1: be the duration of
a senory cycle.

The speed of the processor would be S - l/tgv, operations/sec.
In our case at tT-SOO nanoseconds, 5-2-105 operations/sec.

The actual speed may deviate free this value in both the greater and the lesser
direction. If the duration of an arithmetic-logic operation is greater than one
cycle. the real speed is less than that calculated; it because larger if a "record
in senory" instruction or another not requiring four phases for its execution is
being fulfilled. Creation of a processor with two independent blocksuinstruction
memory and data nemryuensures maximum speed for. the processor. But this method
requires significant equipment outlays to lake the senory blocks independent.

Now let us evaluate the characteristics of the processor when the Ienory is

organized in the traditional for- of a single physical and address field. In
this case the work of the conveyor is delayed during simultaneous interrogation

of the memory in the instruction selection and operand exchange phases. While
instructions may be processed in all phases sisultaneously within the processor
when there are separate lines to the instruction and data nemries, when the
memory is indivisible instructions can be processed sisultaneously in up to two
phases. In this case the speed is halved, and an additional load is imposed on
the processor's separate blocks. Thus the aritlmetic-logic unit executes the
code for the instruction operation and mdifies the address part of the instruc-
tion while the memory interrogation block selects the con-and from the memory and
exchanges operands with it. It should be noted in this case that if the selected
instruction does not require operand exchange, the mesory interrogation block is
now ready to select the next co-and. 'lhis variant of the processor's structure
is typified by nininal equip-ant outlays in comarison with the exasple exanined
above, and by sufficiently effective use of the processor's apparatus. Moreover,
as was noted at the beginning of this article, processor control follows the
nicroprogran principle. and simultaneous control of the processor's independent
blocks requires additional independent groups of word bits in the nicroinstruc-

tion and the associated equipment outlays.

The second variant of the structure results in a rather silple nicroprogran con-
trol unit that ensures simultaneous execution of different phases of two cosmends.

In this case the speed of the processor would be

S - W - 1 ° 106 operations/sec.

Looking at the question of achieving a test interrupt response in this minicomputer,
we should note that this requirement arises when a large nutter of the object's
sensing elements must be interrogated at a high frequency. Moreover depending on

the course of the experiment, the processing program must be switched quickly,
without loss of information.

The rate of the interrupt response is the st. of the following values:
tin.r ' tin.s " tn ‘tcoa* t’06:]. *tnew

where “my-time from the start of an interrupt signal from the source to the
beginning of determination of the nutter of the interrupt signal's source; tn"
time for determining the nuaber of the interrupt signal's source: too.““"' of
comletion of the current processor instruction; twp-time during which the state

of the processor is eclipsed at the moment of interruption; tnew-‘m of establish—
want of the new state of the processor and the beginning of interrupt signal

processing.

Time tin.r is determined from the equipment lag associated with activation of the
electronic circuits and the load on the input-output channel. This tine may be
ignored.

Time tn is determined by searching for the mater of the interrupt signal source;

however, the rigid time limits do not permit the processor to perform this func-
- tion. The master or the unit is determined jointly by the equipment of the input-

output channel and the interrupt signal source itself. He will assume that

tn- 3-5 usec (tn depends on the rate of intonation transmission along the lines
o: the channel in both directions and on the rate of operation of the channel's
equipment in accordance with a special algorithm).

Time tcon is approximately 1 usec: this time also includes the time for determin-
ing the processor state eclipse and recovery zones depending on the nuber of the
interrupt signal source.

Tine tool is defined as an average of four mnory interrogations (eclipsing of the
instruction counter, the state register, the processor accmlator register and
the program base register).

Time they is defined as three interrogations of the nae-wry to establish the new
values of the processor's registers.

Thus tin.r is 8-9 nsec. The operation of determining the water of the interrupt
signal source is coapletely superimposed over the processor's operation, and when
execution of the current command ends, control is transferred to the microprogran
responsible for eclipsing the contents of the processor's registers. This takes

it possible to accelerate the interrupt response.

AUTOMATIC SYSTM FOR ammo DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS

Moscow PRIBORY I SISTER! UPRAVLBNIYA in Russian No 1, Jan 82 p 22

[Article by candidates of technical sciences S. I. Yemets and I. G. Khanin and
engineers S. D. Popovichenko and V. A. Rezvitskiy: "Automatic System for Deter-
mining the Dynamic Characteristics of Actuating Blements"]

[Text] In many cases rigorous demands are made for the dynamic characteristics
of actuating elements, for example the amplitude-phase-frequency characteristic,
the constant times of the transitional processes of acceleration and decelera-
tion, and the time of deflection of the outgoing element (shaft. stun) of the
actuating element. This in turn makes high demands on the means and methods of
functional testing of actuating elements with respect to speed and precision.

Determining dynamic characteristics ordinarily involves oscillograph recording
of the output parameter of the actuating element (displacement of the outgoing
element), then decoding the oscillograms and calculating the characteristics
by known formulas. This method has a low level of precision and is very labor-
intensive; it make automation of the testing processing impossible.

An automatic system has been developed to mutants the processes of functional
testing, improve the precision of measurement of displacements, and determine
dynamic characteristics. The information-measurement part of the system, the
measurement subsystem, contains a displacement sensor; a BS-lSSA contactless
transformer selsyn with a rotor that is rigidly connected to the outgoing ele-
ment of the actuating element; a measurement block which forms at its output
16—bit parallel binary codes of measurement of the coordinate of the outgoing
element -- the displacements that are sent to the storage unit of the computer.

The system has adopted the quantization technique for displacnent in time and
shaping and processing arrays of data on displacement. The technique is imple-
mented using the phase-pulse method of measuring displacements, with time T

of one measurement of a displacement serving as the step of quantization in time.
The system uses an Blektronika-6O microcomputer as control machine. It shapes
control actions for the actuating element and processes measurement data.

The following characteristics of the actuating element are determined as the
result of processing the data that comes to the computer from the measurement
subsystem (this is done using the special software of the system): angle of

rotation of the shaft; average speed of movement; phase delay depending on the
reverse rate; amplitude of oscillations in the amplitude function of a control
action and reverse rate; constant times of the transitional processes of accel-
eration and deceleration of the actuating element.

Analysis of the work of the measurement subsysten showed that in the dynamic
aeasurement regime distortions occur in the shaping of data arrays as the result
of measuring the step of quantization in time. which depends on the rate of dis-
placement of the outgoing element of the actuating element. To evaluate the
distortions the concept of the coefficient of distortion K was introduced:

K - 81/81 - coo/(mom). where 81 is the result of neasurement in cycle 1 (i is
the nude: of the measurement); S O is the actual value of displacement of the
outgoing element at time t - 1T (‘1 - ZI/aoo is the period of rotation of the
stator field of the selsyn, the period of measurement, and the step of quanti-
zation in time); «no and u are the angular velocities of the stator field of the
selsyn and the rotation of the rotor respectively.

In the concrete case I» - (-240 9 +260) degrees/seconds and T - 10'3 with coef-
ficent K - 0.9993'l.0006. The dynamic conponent of relative error in shaping
the information array for displacement of the outgoing element of the actuating
element is GA - (1-0100 - (0.006*0.07) percent.

[Text] Magnetic materials for pulse and high-frequency engineering must have
high electrical resistance. The higher it is, the lower the power losses to
eddy currents will be. Oxide magnetic materials, ferrites. have this property.
In turn, they must match the required magnetic and electrical characteristics,
geometric form. and dimensions strictly. In their production it is necessary
to employ the simplest technological processes, those which insure maximum
output of finished articles.

After the forming operation round ferrite cores (ferrites) usually go through
high-temperature sintering in order to obtain elements with definite magnetic
and electrical parameters. The result is ferrites that consist of individual
coalesced crystals (grains) that influence their properties. The larger the
grains are, the lower the strength of the ferrites will be. In addition,
large grains have microcracks and irregular shape, which impairs their elec-
tromagnetic properties. We also know that sintered ferrite articles are sub-
jected to annealing at 650-800 degrees c for 6-100 hours in a gaseous medium
containing oxygen at a pressure of 0.5.105,5.105 pascal.

The prolonged cycle and complexity of the process of annealing in production
lower the productivity of ferrite articles.

The Hogilev Tekhnopribor Plant has introduced a simplified heat treatment
process that raises productivity 10-15 times while preserving the excellent
electromagnetic properties of the ferrites.

Their heat treatment consists of processing the sintered ferrite cores in a
medium of liquid nitrogen (-206 degrees c) for 0.5-2 hours followed by spon-
taneous hardening to room temperature in order to remove the internal
mechanical stresses that occur with abrupt cooling.

The process is done on equipment manufactured at the plant. Five hundred
thousand ferrite cores contained in a special package are submerged for 30
minutes in a Dewar flask type thermostat. If the number of articles processed
at once is larger. the soaking time is increased to two hours.

The ferrite cores. cooled to the teapereture of liquid nitrogen and soaked in
it for 30 Iinutes, are removed from the thermostat and the process of spon-
taneous hardening begins (the telperature of the ferrite cores begins to rise

to roo- tenperature) .

Because of high and low temperature oscillations in the ferrite cores, the
ferrite grains which are irregular in shape and have nicrocrecks break down
into fine. full-value grains and the mosaic blocks are refined.

Simplification of the heat treatment process and raising productivity vhile
preserving the good electronsgnetic properties of the ferrite cores after
introduction of cryogenic treatnent produced an economic benefit of 127,000

rubles a year.

[Text] In addition to a detailed de-ncription of the ASSMLR language, its close
relationship with the operating systan and the service which it offers the pro-
grs-aer user for the purpose of the fullest utilization of the resources of a
computing facility is revealed. The discussion of the naterial proceeds fro-
concspte of the structure of simple program to the develop-mt of progran conplexes.
Variants of conbining program are described: during conpilation, input of the
task, editing of connectives and execution.

For users of Yes [Unified Series] conputera and W2 students in the appropriate
fields of specialization.

Because of linited space the following questions ere not represented in this book:
progra-ing for numbers in a for-at with a floating point, programing at the

physical level, files on punched tape, necroprogra-ing and programing in the
tine sharing node.

This book contains the basic infornation needed by a programsr in writing and
debugging program and program complexes. It is also useful to progra-aers writing
prograns in high-level languages such as 91.11. MM and 00801.. This book is
addressed to students studying third—generation nachines and to specialists who

are inproving their knowledge in the area of attending to and using software for
Yes conputer models.

The author expresses her gratitude to Doctor of Technical Sciences 6.x. Gavrilov
and Candidate of Technical Sciences m. RAM for their valuable cements and
suggestions in writing the nanuscript.

[Article by v. N. Balakirev, O. H. Balashov, V. P. Petlinskiy and V. P. Tyurin
from book “Materials on Cowuter Software'.. edited by I. A. Sher, candidate of
technical sciences, Sibirskiy energeticheskiy institut SO AN SSSR (821)]

['next] An increase in the proportion of problems oriented toward work in inter-
active node, or in ones close to it, can be observed today. Thus for example, the
following dialogue systems can function, and are broadly employed, in the 05
DISPAx/VESH-S muter system: For program editing and debugging (DIM. am, KOP.
SBRVIS, nets, PUL‘T, swan etc.): for service operations (010?. Dth. ZAP. PK.
SERB, MI etc.): a number of systems for problem oriented research. Obviously as
a branched terminal network develops, this trend will be amplified (1).

Each of the dialogue resources used for comnication with the mute: user is
typified on one hand by consunpticn of a certain amount of the resources of the
computer system to support its normal operation. and on the other hand by a
certain area of use. At the same time almost all such problems handled by the

06 DISPAX have an equally privileged status and enjoy equal priority in selection
for solution. 'mis can be explained by the fact that they are not differentiated
by rank in any way at this stage. For couparison purposes we can note that systems
controlling admission of problems for solution, based on class ranking in accordance
with a number of criteria, have already been developed for batch processing (2,3).
the need for such a system regulating the mission of dialogue problems arises
especially when there is a scarcity of terminal equipment and of computer resources
used in dialogue systems (main memory lists and magnetic drum boosting channels)
and when dialogue resources are available to all users. Such ranking lust be
accounted for during times when the terninal network experiences peak loads (day-
time on work days): work on an unrestricted schedule is permissible in those times
when overloads are known not to occur in the terminal network (night time and days
off).

me principal criteria used to rank dialogue problems are: unit consumption of
computer system resources to service one terminal of a certain dialogue system;
area of applicability or broadness of use of a concrete dialogue system by a group
of users; status of a particular terminal of a total nuiser of terminals; status
of a particular user.

FOR omégl. USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

When dialogue resources are ranked in relation to the first criterion, sultiterminal
monitoring systems have an advantage over single-terminal system. In an OS DISPAK,

the first criterion may be based on information provided during composition of the
call code for the appropriate dialogue system.

The rank of a problem may be determined in relation to the second criterion from
information furnished by a human adninistrator. Such information may be repre-
sented by the code (codes) of one (several) most popular dialogue systems.

Not all terminals have an identical status. We define terminals which may be
used in accordance with a rigid schedule type 1 terminals. hype 1 terminals are

the "personal property" of a certain set of users, and they can be used to run any
dialogue problem within the allocated time. All other terminals are type 2

terminals. They are the “collective property” of the corputer center users, and

work is permitted with them at any time of the day, though only in multiterminal
systems.

Introduction of the fourth criterion is necessary because there is always a

group of users for whom access is permitted at any time and from any terminal.
This list of users usually includes the system programmers and those performing
urgent functions, and it is drawn up by the administrator.

Programs regulating admission of dialogue problem in an OS DISPAK have been
written in accordance with the criteria described above. They include two program

packages contained within the OS DISPAK and a utility service program used to
schedule the work of the terminals.

The first package of the OS DIsPhx contains a sxom nonresident module, and it
goes into operation at the mment a request for a dialogue system is keyed in.

The functions of this module include: determination of the correspondence of the
type of dialogue system requested to the type of terminal: verification of per-
mission to work at the given time, if this is a type 1 terminal; comarison of the
user's code with the list of privileged users, if the first two checks produced a
negative result.

In the event that any one of the three checks produces a positive result, the

problem request becomes a candidate for solution, and it is admitted to the input
queue of the processor planner. Otherwise the appropriate diagnosis is fed to the
terminal.

The second package of the OS DISPAK functions periodically at a rate determined
by the work of the nonresident module NOMBOB (about once every 2 seconds). The
functions of this package include monitoring the order of work on those dialogue
problems which are presently undergoing solution in both active and passive states
(in the sense of occupying the processor's time). Five minutes before the
scheduled time for working one (several) dialogue problem expires, this block
transmits, to the required terminal (terminals), a warning to the user that the
time allotted by the terminals scheduled for the work is expiring. When the
allotted time expires, problem solution is mandatorily halted and the appropriate

reason is entered into the statistics.

'Ihe following tables and scales, located within one of the zones of. a 2053 systemic
disc, are used as the input intonation to support the work of these packages:

a section operation scheduling table (‘9 to 10010 sections, beginning with nunber
0010 and ending with nunber 9910); a table scheduling the work of terminals for the
day (up to 64 terminals); a table of codes for multiterminal system; a table of
codes for priority users (up to 20): a scale of type 1 tar-inals (this one scale

is enough because all other terminals are automatically treated as type 2 terminals)

schedules drawn up by resources of the dialogue systems themselves. Here are
the most significant of them:

This system is more convenient and easier to operate because it does not require
creation of a schedule for each of the dialogue systems contained within the com-
puter center-that is, multiple redundancy is not required:

the same functions need not be made redundant in several dialogue systems. which
reduces the outlays on their development;

the possibility of engaging “one's own“ dialogue syste- without the awareness of
the administration is totaly excluded;

there is less ”trash” (unneeded information) in the statistics on solved problems.
since achission to a dialogue program is analyzed before the program is placed
in the input queue.

[Text] During the 10th Five-Year Plan the Krivororhstal' [Krivoy Rog Steel]
Plant imeni V. I. Lenin completed development, testing. refinement, and intro-
duction of an automated system for dispatcher control (A800) of a metallur-
gical enterprise with a full production cycle. The system is designed to
provide the enterprise management and dispatcher service with operational data
on the state of the production uniuaand quantitative and qualitative indicators
of the work of the principal plant subdivisions: sintering plant; two blast
furnace shops and three steel foundries, three blooming mills, three section
rolling shops, and warehouses for cast iron, steel ingots, and finished rolled
products. The plant Asw under consideration is the connecting element between
the upper and lower levels of the hierarchy in an integrated system of enter-
prise control (the subsystem for operational calendar planning on the one hand,
and shop industrial organization automated control system on the other).

Figure 1 below shows the functional structure of the A800, which has eight sub-
systems. The principal functions performed by the ASDU are given in the table
(below).

In these subsystems the course of production is accounted for and monitored
chiefly on a shift and daily breakdown with information in running totals from
the start of the month. Operational data are outputted on request to the screens
of video terminals (SID-1,000's) which are installed for the director, chief en-
gineer, chief of the production division. and the plant dispatcher service.
These data are also printed out in the form of shift and daily datasheets and
dispatcher reports. The A501! has a special complex of data recording and repv
resentation problens to support these functions.

The hardware of the ASDU (see Figure 2 below) includes units to collect data
and transmit information, data processing means, and a set of devices for rep-
resentation and recording results and processing data.

The means of data collection are represented by a set of automatic instruments
and signaling devices, consoles for manual data input. and specialised video
terminals. Automatic data collection instruments are mounted on the two coke
feed conveyors and on the sinter conveyor. They are tensonetric conveyor

designed to produce signals on the presence or absence of netal in the nonitored
section or to fern signals on the state of particular unite.

The following signals are shaped by the use of sinple relay circuits: "Operating"
and "Down" for sintering nachines; "Full Speed." "Slow Speed," and ”Tap" for

blast furnaces; ”Operating." "Down," and "Tapping Steel" for converters and open
hearth furnaces. For the rolling sills the "Operating" and "Down" states are re~

corded by the tine that lapses betveen the passage of two adjacent rolled lengths
through a certain section of the mill. This tine is read by photorelay pulses.
These sane pulses are used to count the number of rolled pieces. The "Repair"

state is fed by service personnel of the appropriate units using special switches.

The use of SIET's lakes it possible to set up a nesaege 112 characters long (the
capacity of one page of nelory), store it in buffer Ienory, display it on the
screen, and trans-it it to the pipeline and computer. The total capacity of the
8131' sensory is up to 10 pages of 112 characters apiece. The contents of each
page can be displayed on the screen; the characters are 15 by 24 nillinetera in
size for a picture tube of 59-61 centiaeters on the diagonal, and they can be
seen from up to 15 meters. As any as 12 television receivers at distances up to
two kiloaeters can be connected to the pipeline. Data is exchanged with the con-
puter by neana of a builtin interlinking device to a telephone line up to 14
kilometers long. The speed of exchange is 600 bands.

Use of SIBT's as renote terminals nade it possible to raise the operational

qulity of production data input to the computer, significantly reduce the volume
of data which operations personnel must transnit exclusively for input to the
computer; and, improve the reliability of data being fed by shop production

personnel's nonitoring it and repeating the input in case of errors. further-
nore, use of SIBT's ends it possible to increase the volune of information
coming to the dispatcher and plant asnager because qualitative indicators (cheni-
cal analyses of raw asterials, fuel, nalted pig iron, slag, and steel) of the
work of the blast and steel foundry shops were recorded and displayed. In rolling

production the 818T pernits a more detailed (by grades of steel and dinensions of
sections) record of performance of orders.

The data display equipnent of the A800 conprises the dispatcher's panel and con-
sole and five SID-1.000 data display stations. The dispatcher panel is designed
for indicating the current state of production by lights and giving warning sig-
nals. lnforntion on the states of the principal industrial processes (work,
downtine, and repair). on output actually produced since the beginning of the
shift or day, and deviations fros assigmsents are outputted to the panel; it also
indicates the beginning and end of tapping cast iron and steel. Operational
digital intonation is outputted to the dispetcher panel following a request of
the dispatcher console. All inforaation on the course of production and state of
the production units can be shown on the panel by the dark or light panel cir-
cuit following a dispatcher instruction. when the state of the production unit
changes the blinking signal can be "skvitirovan" [possibly "stopped"].

The software of the A800 includes sore than 120 programs for feeding and process-
ing operational information, accounting for and analyzing production. shaping
arrays of plan and sauna,“ outputting data on production through display and
printing units and makes it possible to nodify programs efficiently. This is
epsecially iqortant in the initial stages of functioning of the system, and also
provides a possibility of regenerating stored data after nelfunction and per-its
work in real tine where there is a large amber of subscribers.

The sets of probleas of the A500 are executed under the control of an RV disk
operating systen. During generation of the system drivers of systes terminals
free standard ASVT H-6.000 software. the driver of the nonstandard unit for
interlinking the telemechanical system of the cosputing couples. and the driver
of the 8131' are used.

All user programs which deaand rapid response to changed external conditions are
formulated as disk resident program and have the "swapping" feature. Only a
few high-priority problens are executed as internal senory-resident progress.

The systen of dispatcher control can work in an eutonatic regime and a correc-
tion regiae. In the automatic regine data caning from the telemechanical system
fron the 313T are subjected to logical aonitoring, after which authorisation is
given to switch in the user problems of accounting and analysis that shape the
working and resulting data arrays. Production schedules are put into the con-
puting cosplex at the beginning of the day; planning information is fed at the
start of the south. The results of performance of problems can be displayed on
the SID-1,000 screen and on the dispatcher panel on request. Upon completion

of a certain period (shift or day) the corresponding dispatcher reports are
forsulated and printed.

The correction regime is used to restore the work capability of the system

after malfunctions in the computer complex; when the system is down data input
by punched tape is envisioned.

The A800 being described is based on application of a system of file control.
This made it possible to construct the above-named sets of problems on the
modular principle and, therefore, to write and debug the programs for them in-
dependently of one another. The structure of the information base and program
nodules of the system is done in a way that insures the possibility of enlarg-
ing the total volume of raw data, including data in the system of data con—
ponenta, without significant expenditures for reprogramming.

Access to the data arrays is accomplished by means of appropriate manuals. The
internal memory stores only the information array; the results of processing in

the form of a working array and a resulting array are copied on external media
(magnetic disks).

The working and resulting arrays give information, respectively, for the cur-

rent (for example since the start of the day) and preceding time segments. The
structures of these arrays are practically identical, which makes it possible

for the system, without additional efforts for programming. to store and print
out or display data on the current and preceding period (shifts or days) and to

make corrections for the preceding period and to the running total in case in-
formation is fed late.

Because of the limited memory volume printing does not use buffering, but

rather is done with output of data through a common region where data, recoded
in symbolic form. are copied to output one line (up to 120 characters). The
data are outputted; then the readiness of the alphanumeric printers for further
work is analyzed and the next line is outputted after recoding.

The system has established monitoring of completion of jobs by a periodic check
on the presence of filled information arrays and putting the corresponding jobs
in a queue (information arrays are cleared when the job is completed).

The ASDU we have described is a system of operational accounting for production
so it is natural that when information is accumulated from the start of the

month certain discrepancies between it and the figures of plant accounting docu-
ments will occur. To avoid this the A800 has organized input of refined infor-
mation on production and the distribution of the principal types of output based

on data from the planning division and production division of the plant. This
is as follows: each day before 1500 the plant management service prepares re-
fined information for the plant management concerning the actual course of
production from the start of the month until completion of the preceding day.
One copy of this document is sent to the ASDU duty officer. who must put this
information in the computer before 2300.

Thus. in the A800 information on production from the start of the month always

includes refined figures for the end of the preceding day and operational data
for the current day. This makes it possible to formulate information on pro-
duction from the start of the month with a high degree of authenticity and to
simplify synchronization procedures with the process when the system is restarted.

The links between the asw and other levels or control are conditioned by the
fact that it is part of the integrated plant ASUP [automated system for pro-
duction control] and exchanges infomtion with the euBsysten for operational
calendar planning at the highest level and with the shop production-organiza-
tional automated control systems at the lowest level.

In the llth Five-Year Plan the A800 of the Krivorozhstel' Plant imeni V. I.-
Lenin is to be connected in to the sector automated control syste- that is under
development. The problems of integration make additional demands for the or-
ganization of A800 software, and as a result the latter has a special set of
programs for shaping data files with subsequent trannission to these automated
control systems.

Introduction of the system into operation by stages began in 1977 with a gradual
enlargenent of the functions and refinenent of software and hardware. The eco-
nomic impact of introduction of the system is 770,000 rubles of a year owing

to a reduction in production losses and penalties. It is contewlated that the
fundamental decisions with respect to functional structure. methods and means
of collecting data, processing. recording, and displaying information, software,
and monitoring and diagnosis techniquee will he used to build system for oper-
ational control of primary production at other ferrous netallurgical plants.

[Article by doctor of technical sciences s. K. SObolev, candidates of technical
sciences R. H. Nikolaychdg V. S. Begushevskiy and N. A. Sorekin, and engineers
S. V. Piregev and A. A. Rogoznyy: "Dispatcher Control of a Converter Shop"]

[Excerpts] Studies of the work of converter shops show that 5-10 percent of
the calendar time is taken up by production unit downtime related to organiza-
tional factors. without operational information on the state of the equipment
and availability of charge materials, the production preparation foremen and
shift heads essentially do not have time to control production. Moreover, it
is impossible for an ASU T? [automated control system for industrial processes]
to function successfully without solving dispatcher problems.

The Yenakiyevo Metallurgical Plant has launched an ASU T? for a converter shop.
It performs both production and dispatcher jobs. The system is based on s
two-processor “-6.000 control computer complex. It collects information on the
work of the main shop sectors and controls them. Information on the work of
particular sectors and equipment of the converter shops is outputted to the
control panel of the foreman for production preparation of the converter shop
(see Figure 1 [not reproducedl).

The basic information is formed automatically from local data collection net-
works with realization 0; corresponding algorithms on the H—6,000 control com.
puter complex. Information on the working order of the valves, the operation
of the mixers. and the presence of the slag hopper and steelmaking ladle under
the converter is fed manually in the form of position signals.

The local circuit for determining the position of the cast iron ladles and

their loading uses information on the delivery of the empty ladle to the scales.
pouring cast iron into the ladle, transporting it, and pouring the cast iron
into the converter. Information on the weight of cast iron in the miners comes
from the sensor of the angle of inclination of the mixer for pouring iron into
the ladle, the sensor that determines the number of ladles poured into the mixer,
and the local circuit that monitors mixer were during the operating process.

Information on the technological operations of the converter travels from the
local circuit, which considers the angle of inclination of the converter and

receipt of signals on engagesent of the blast, lowering the lance into the con-
vertor, the introduction of loose naterial. and the duration of the blasting
process. Information on the time that pouring in the pouring area begins and
ends, the shop number of the melt being poured, and the type of ingot molds
travels fro- the nnual data input console installed in the pouring Bay.

The work of the dispatcher is controlled differently depending on the nature
of the indicating paraseter and the source of origin of the intonation: from
the dry contacts of the circuits for control of industrial equipment, from the
“-6.000 control cowuter comlex, and a mixed form. Control from the “-6.000
complex is accomplished by means of a special interface block DIP—'1' which is
connected directly to a 2K interlink. Control is done by sessages of four
binary-decimal hits apiece.

Industrial use of the dispatcher part of the system made it possible to raise
shop productivity by three percent and insure rhythmic production. The economic
impact fron introduction of the system was about 200,000 rubles a year.

['Dext] In research on random processes, the need arises in a number of cases for
evaluating the process under analysis on the basis of its amplitude characteristics.
For example if we are to evaluate stresses arising in the hull of a vessel as it
moves over a wavy surface, it we are to evaluate the sea state and so on, we would
need to analyse not the entire temporal series but only its asplitudinal values,
spread and periodicity.

This article examines one of the methods of calculating the amlitudes and half
periods of a random process.

Assume we are dealing with a random process 1:; (i-o,l...N—l). a portion of which
is shown in Figure l. uplitudes A1, 142..., AR must be isolated and their distri-
bution law must be plotted.

The problem is solved in two stages. In the first stage we isolate all extreme

we esploy in this case is the change in sign of successively calculated differences
between two neighboring ordinates--that is, (xi-arid), (mtg-cg) etc. If such a
change in sign occurred. then the value of the lower ordinate is taken as the sought
extremum and entered into the set of extremums (aj). Concurrently we enter into

- the memory the current time (tj) corresponding to this extremum. (At azi-xi-1-0 a
transition occurs to the next difference.)

[Article by candidate of technical sciences L. I. Orlov, chief of the Special
Design Bureau of Geophysical Instrt-ent ﬂaking: "Proﬁle-s of Building
Standardized Infomtion-Heasurenent systems in Geophysical Instrunmt ﬂaking”

[Text] The current level of technology used in carrying on exploration for
petroleun, gas, and other nineral products is detemined by the level of de-
velopsant and production of geophysical equipnent. The econonic and technical
indicators of the use of the equip-cut, which are the basis of the economic in-
dicators of geophysical studies. depend above all on the qualitative paran-
eters (infornstional value, precision, and the like) and quantitstive features
(speed of the experisent, rate of data processing, and the like). It is clear
that both kinds of characteristics can be improved by refining proven geo-
physical research techniques and by applying new nethods of exploration. The
develop-mt of geophysical techniques depends on refining the latest scientific
and teclmical advances to inrove these techniques. This makes clear how in-
portant it is for geophysical work to develop and quickly introduce highly
productive nodern equip-en: [l].

The trends in developnent of geophysical systole permit us to single out the
nain features that necessitate the application of efficient nsans of process-
ing neasurensnt data and auto-sting control and nonitoring of the neaauraaent
process. Along these features are the increase in umber of channels, di-
versity of the sensors that nsasure the paransters of various physical fields ,
the inact of external factors, the cosplexity of the functions of controlling
the neasurensnt process and outputting data, and the require-eats for diagnostic
procedures. In geophysical syste-s these problem are traditionally solved
chiefly by neans of analog counters. or in eone cases special digital con-
puters (the L'l'sK-lo well-logging unit, the Progress seismic unit, and others).
Various types of software (logic blocks, progran blocks, and the like) based
on rigid logic are applied to solve the problens of controlling the neasurs-
nsnt process.

This neth of construction necessitates individualization of the algorithm
of the control process, prevents expansion of the cysts: and enlarging its

characteristics and the variety of geophysical techniques make it necessary to
have easy individual elements. for each case, in measurement and convertor units.
This results in greater coaplexity of geophysical information and aeasnrement
systems. overly narrow specialization. and orientation to solving concrete

problems. As a result, a large number of narrowly specialised systems have
appeared in recent years.

The situation that has come about poses the challenge of standardizing geo-
physical equipment for different research techniques. This would reduce the
time required for development and incorporation into production and produce a
major economic impact in the national economy. The development of standardised

equipment would act as the "jumping off place" for increasing the pace of tech-
nical re-equipping of geophysical work.

The purpose of the present article is to formulate the fundamental principles
of building a standardized geophysical measurement-computing complex. The de-

velopment of a new basic element in recent years. microprocessor computer equip-
ment, is useful in solving this problem.

The principal techniques of geophysical exploration today are seismic explora-
tion, electrical exploration, and geophysical well studies. The latter in-
clude also techniques of studying the geological cross-section during the drill-
ing process (gas logging and monitoring the industrial parameters of drilling)
because in many cases analysis of drilling parameters gives a reliable descrip-
tion of the geological structure through which the well passes.

Technical equipment for contemporary seismic exploration includes sources that
generate Puwaves (longitudinal) and s-waves (transverse) and a seismic recording
system. Figure 1 shows the typical structure of the recording system. It re—
flects the fundamental principles of construction of all seismic stations pro.
duced in the USSR, including newly developed ones produced by the Moscow
Geofizpribor [Geophysical Instrument] Production Association (the Progress Sta-

tion). Trends in the development of seismic recording systems are analyzed in
detail in work [2].

Equipment for electrical exploration work includes generators of electromagnetic
fields (direct or alternating) and various types of apparatus to receive and
record emissions after they interact with the geological formation. Plants of
the Ministry of Instrument Making, Automation Equipment, and Control Systems and

the USSR Ministry of Geology are producing about 20 types of recording equipment
for electrical exploration methods. Most electrical exploration systems are

analog types with few channels. The Tees-2 shown in the block diagram in
Figure 2 is a typical representative of a digital electrical exploration unit.
Enterprises of the Ministry of Instrument Making. Automation Equipment. and
Control Systems are planning the production of multichannel digital electrical
exploration stations (TeEs-3). Many institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences,
the USSR Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education, and the USSR
Ministry of Geology are working on building multichannel digital recording sys-
tems for electrical exploration.

designed for geophysical studies under different conditions. Host of them
are analog systems. The stations to monitor industrial parameters during the
drilling process based on characteristics are in large part siailar to the
logging and gas—logging stations mentioned above.

Despite the diversity of equipment in use, with respect to functionsl structure
all these stations are similar to one another. and some differences do not
cause fundamental changes in their structure. This gives reason to consider
geophysical stations on the level of execution of functions as geophysical
information-measurement system. The heart of any information-measurement
system, including the geophysical one, is the measurement-computing complex
(HCC). Its structure does not depend on application, operating conditions.

or geological technique employed by the particular geophysical information-
measurement system.

The functions of any measurement system can be realised by various methods
which make up the set of structures. For this reason the central 188068 0f
development of geophysical information-measurement systems are selecting and
substantiating the structure of the system, defining the function of CO.”-
nication with the object. and analyzing and realizing algorithms for moni-

toring and controlling the object and algorithms for exchange of information
with the operator.

It must be observed that in recent years new. have developed along the paths
of ever-increasing volume of data processing, more thorough diagnosis of the
state of the system, and a more complete volume of informtion represented for
interpretation, in a form that is more convenient for consideration. At the
present time the trends in development of the structures of geophysical HCC's
have hardly been formulated. But the necessity of working out a uniform con-
ception for the development of HCC's demands that they be defined.

Analysis of the structure of contemporary ucc'e used in various fields of
science and technology shows that they are practically all constructed on the
pipeline principle of data exchange among units included in the comlex [3].
Data on signals that are measured and outputted, information on switches, and
control and auxiliary signals that define the processes of information ex-
change are transmitted along the pipelines.

Other equally important characteristics of contemporary HCC's are modular
construction and microprogram control of the process of data collection and

processing, and of the system and diagnosis. For this structure they are obli-
gated to the developments of microprocessor technology and microcomputers,

which make it possible to develop specialized units that realize very diverse
control and computing functions, in other words to set up an aggregate system
on the principle of pipeline-modular construction vi th microprogram control.

It is equally important that the use of microcomputers and microprocessors
opens broad opportunities for realizing a number of functions: statistical
processing. error correction, monitoring work capability, diagnosis, forecasting
malfunctions, and others. The realization of these additional functions, which

57

improve astrological characteristics and raise technical-economic indicators,
insures a qualitatively higher level of geophysical mc's.

The technical-economic efficiency of using microprocessors and microcowuters
results, in addition to the obvious factors. from the possibility of both an-
larging the microcomputer or microprocessor system itself and adding additional
peripheral equipment without altering the entire system. Designing for a con-
crete problem becomes reprograming without modification or simply a matter

of adding certain assedalies or sensors.

The use of microprocessor computer equipment creates conditions for con-
structing geophysical measurement-information systeas on new ”architectural
principles. There are broad opportunities for the development of system with
parallel processing (single-level multiprocessor systems) and multiprocessor
systems with multilevel architecture. In such geophysical measurement-
information systems the microprocessor (microcosputer) at the lowest level
linearizes the output qualities of the sensors, corrects errors. and controls
the channels for co-unication with the microprocessor (or microcolputer) of
the higher level. At the highest levels data is processed according to as-
signed algorithms and the sort of processing is controlled.

Thus, the pipeline-modular principle of constructing net's using micro-
processor or computer equipment is the basis on which it is possible to
standardize geophysical equipment and improve metrological support and the
quality of processing of geophysical data. All this will make it possible to
solve the problem of sharply expanding the volume of production of geophysical
equipment in the llth and 12th five-year plans.

For Hcc's based on pipeline-modular structure there must be, in the stage of
concrete technical realization: analysis of the logical algorithms of process-
ing data for control, eonitoring, and diagnosis; analysis and selection of
hardware and means of realizing these algorithms while concurrently optimizing
them. and development of hardware for machine realization of algorithms or
programs for software realisation.

The special characteristics of using a geophysical "CC make additional require-
ments for such technical specifications as dimensions. weight, power consum-
tion, and resistance to mechanical and climatic effects. This demands, in
turn. that in the development of geophysical HCC's concepts be found vhich
differ fundamentally from those for other ncc's. The technology of geophysical
work that exists at the present time and. for all appearances. will continue
in the near future, ordinarily defines the collection and initial processing
of information by simplified parameters. This outlines the range of problem
for which geophysical ucc'a will be built: collection of information frat
numerous sensors, preliminary data processing, control of the process of re-
cording information on long-term media, and system monitoring and diagnosis.

The results of analysis of geophysical measurement systems given above made it

possible to identify a number of cannon features that satisfy different condi-
tions of the application of tuck in seismic recording, electrical exploration.

and field geophysical systems. Bearing in mind that microprocessor equipment
is the foundation for newly developed Hcc's. we must formulate the following
specifications. which are most typical for the geophysical “06 being de-

A key decision that determines the level of standardization in building a
geophysical HCC is selection of the microcomputer. This is done on the basis
of analyzing the generalized processing function, and the functions of control,
nonitoring, and diagnosis reviewed above. The system of conmunication be-
tween the machine and peripheral equipment or many machines in multiprocessor
systems depends on the microcomputer that is used.

The microcomputers being produced at the present time have a limited assort-
ment of units for communication with the object, but there is a capability of
connecting various peripheral units to the pipeline of the machine. Because
the assortment of such devices in geophysical ncc'a is small and operating con-
ditions for them do not permit the use of series-produced instruents with
output to machine-independent pipelines (HER, CAHAC), it would be advisable

to use the pipeline of the machine itself. But it is designed to connect up

a definite number of peripheral units and increasing this number disturbs the
established optimality and leads to unjustified expenditures of hardware and
software. In such cases, nonetheless, it is better to add one of the standard
machine-independent pipelines to the system. The most reasonable one to use
for geophysical ucc's is the HEX pipeline.

The level of standardization in development of HCC's will depend on the level
of centralization of processing functions; a high level of centralization
makes higher demands for the computing power of the central microcomputer.
This means that it is likely there will be some cases where realisation of
certain processing functions must he accomplished at the lower level of the
structure (variation of realization of a multilevel structure).

The latter became possible with the appearance of built-in microprocessor
equipment. Of the microcomputers now in production, the Elektronika 60. the
Elektronika NTs-O3D, and SH 1800 meet these requirements most fully. Series
production of the Elektronika “Ts-8091, a single-card microcomputer now under
development, is to begin this year. It has greater speed, smaller dimensions,
and is compatible with the sn-3 and SH-b machines. In terms of technical
specifications this microcomputer most fully meets the requirements made for
the machine in the geophysical HCC: speed of 300,000 operations a second,

16 bit positions, power consumption of 10 watts, and weight of 0.2 kilograms.

He must observe again that the path to standardisation of geophysical equip-
ment is blocked by numerous problems linked to the traditionally established
departmental approach to development. This does not mean, however, that the
particular organizational-technical difficulties cannot be overcome. Without
going into questions of organization here, we can give examples of technical
solutions to problems of this sort: development of the CAHAC pipeline-modular
system (State All-Union Standard 26.201.80), the "Common Line" interface (the

DEC Company of the United States), the standard for the digital interface for
1838-488-78 programmable measuring instruments, and others.

Formulation of software is becoming an important question in the development of
geophysical HCC's based on microcomputers and microprocessors. The software
is given three basic jobs: processing incoming information. controlling the

60

FOR|DFFKJAI.USE(NULY

measurement process, and system monitoring and diagnosis. These jobs involve
realization of the functions of data input-output, conversion of data, various

types of corrections. producing control signals with a definite sequence. and
executing monitoring and diagnostic procedures.

Field geophysical studies contemplate chiefly collection and preliminary
processing of data; this means that the peripheral equipment of the MCC usually
does not have to have control feedback. In this case processor time will be
fully controlled by the operating system. and instructions will be carried out
one after another in sequence. The operating system is degenerated into a
package of drivers for communications and information exchange by the input-
output devices. For this reason it is advisable to use the operating system of
the machine selected. In real-time systems (logging stations, stations to

monitor geological-industrial parameters, and the like) it will be necessary
to formulate more complex control programs.

The language in which the user programshis jobs in a geophysical system can be
constructed by three variations: development of one's own language, selection
of a standard language, or development of a supplement to a standard language.
The first variation offers the possibility of taking account of all special
features of the jobs being performed, but the process of developing a library
of standard and applied programs is labor-intensive and complex. In.the
second place program processing is much simpler, even though the language may
prove insufficiently effective to solve the specific geophysical problem.

In some cases it is advisable to add missing characteristics necessary for the
work of geophysical systems to the programming language selected.

If we have application in mind, the main thing in development of software for
a standardized geophysical use is simplicity of fitting it to specific geo-
physical systems, the possibility of modification. This is provided by the
modular principle of construction of the Hcc. The software should be oriented
to formulating control (initial load, planning the operation, control of mea-
surements, input-output. and diagnosis) and special-purpose programs which
include preliminary processing. computations, correction of drift, analysis
of diagnostic results, and the like.

The special-purpose programs must be developed individually for different
cases of the application of a geophysical ncc; the control programs are gener-
ally similar.

The error of measurement of parameters in a geophysical measurement-information
system is determined by the precision characteristics of the sensors them-
selves. the behavior of the system in a dynamic regime, and the influence

of external factors. The parameters of the sensors can be considered given,
which is reflected on the magnitude of error of data processing defined in the

stage of formulating technical specifications for designing the MCC. This

makes it clear how important it is to select the best processing algorithms in
the HCC in order to realize the precision characteristics of the system.

For metrological support of the geophysical MCC, after manufacture and periodi-
cally during the process of operation the error of measurement of the most

61

important parameters must be monitored. When geophysical ncc's are used
under field conditions far from bases Built-in metrological support systems
must be provided.

In connection with the rise in quality requirements for geophysical measure-
ments and the growing complexity of the equipment, the technical level and
precision requirements for monitoring instruments are rising. The great
diversity of geophysical equipment and the heightened requirement for monitor-
ing instruments often make it impossihle to insure the necessary precision
characteristics fully and on time. Standardization of ncc's will permit
standardization of monitoring instruments and techniques, which will greatly
reduce the time required to manufacture and introduce new geophysical systems.

The formulation of a standardized HCC based on microprocessor colputer equip-
ment will offer an opportunity to diagnose the system on a fundamentally new
level. realize program procedures for diagnosis, and attain a higher level of
diagnosis and forecasting malfunctions both for the H00 and for the geophysical
system as a whole. The diagnostic "capabilities" of the system are specially
important in geophysical ncc's which are used to monitor geological-industrial

parameters during the drilling process. Forecasts of various types of coupli-
cations and emergency situations will be decided right in the drilling process,

for exawle anomalous layer pressures, or wear on casing colours and twisted
lengths of pipe.

The introduction of a standardized microprocessor system will be a decisive
contribution to meeting the challenges of accelerated introduction of con-
teworary scientific-technical advances in geophysical instrument making.

The principal factors here that sharply raise all technical-economic indicators
are improvement in metrological characteristics, reducing the use of elec-
tricity, raising reliability, decreasing dimensions. and reducing time required
for development and incorporation in production. Preliminary calculations show
that with introduction of standardised geophysical masurement-information

systems power consumption is decreased 250-300 percent, labor-intensity is
decreased 200 percent, and development time is cut 2-2.5 times.

The development of a standardised geophysical HCC will be a strong basis for
iaplementing new geophysical techniques and will help meet the challenges of
the llth and 12th five-year plans for the development of geophysical instruent
making.

[Excerpts] Introduction

The main requirements imposed on cybernetic systems currently being developed are
high rates of information processing, large amount of storage, extremely high
reliability, minimum consumption of energy and, in addition, small dimensions and
low equipment cost. One way of improving these parameters is to use optical
methods and devices that permit processing information in the form of large two-
dimensional arrays (pictures). In doing so, more extensive functional capabilities
are provided by using as the information medium coherent light that, compared to
noncohercnt light, has higher information capacity in a natural way permits
processing of information in the form of complex functions and fields.

The need for coherent optical information processing devices (KOU) long ago became
ripe in such fields as analysis (conversion, recognition) of images, for example,

in aerial photography, data transmission, medical and biological information pro-
cessing, photogrammetry, etc.; performing information retrieval operations in
catalogs, directories, archives and others; multichannel processing of radio and
acoustic signals, especially in systems for radio detection and ranging, navigation,
exploration of natural resources, seismic prospecting and others [1].

Modern computers are ill-suited for solving these problems, since they are primarily
machines for calculations and control. But KOU's, conversely, are suited primarily

for processing information in arrays of 103-107 bits each.

The major problems in the field of coherent optical methods and devices for informa-
tion processing are real-time input of information into the K00 and on-line recon-
figuration of optical circuits needed in executing complex data processing algo-
rithms. Both these problems can be solved by using electrically and optically

As a result of research performed in many laboratories, certain progress has been
observed in recent years in the development of controllable transparencies, since

a number of the most promising materials has been determined for spatial-tins light
modulation [3, 4]. Of primary importance among them are nematic liquid crystals
(ZhK). They are distinguished by the exceptional diversity of electroopticsl
effects that permit developing both amplitude and phase controllable transparencies
based on them [2, 9]. The major advantages of liquid crystals are high trans-
mittance and sensitivity to control voltages and power, and also the adaptability
to manufacture of the instruments based on them.

when this work was begun (1972), the basic properties and electrooptical effects in
liquid crystals had been studied [9]. However, there remained to be investigated
the link between many major characteristics of spatial light modulation in electri-
cally and optically controllable liquid crystal structures and the parameters of
liquid crystals, as well as of other materials of these structures. Also of great
interest was the analysis of maximally achievable parameters of liquid crystal
structures and the controllable transparencies based on them. Finally, it was
necessary to examine the possibilities of new methods and circuits for conversion
and coding of optical signals that are opened when spatial modulators are used in

them, and in particular, controllable transparencies based on liquid crystal
structures.

Chapter 1. Spatial Modulation of Light in Liquid Crystal-Structures and Its Use
for Conversion and Coding of Optical Signals

The above analysis of physical methods of spatial light modulation in liquid
crystal structures and the achievement in the area of creating BUT and our
[electrically and optically controllable transparencies] based on liquid crystals
indicate that they basically meet the requirements imposed on controllable trans-
parencies intended for coding and converting optical signals (images). Their
development and application has permitted demonstrating the great promise of opto-
electronic circuits and methods of optical information processing. One can note
that with that of greatest interest are the phase controllable transparencies that
permit realization of numerous algorithms for optical processing with minimal
losses of light power [15]. From the viewpoint of the direction of further re-
search, now coming into the foreground are the problems of optimizing the para-
meters of the liquid crystal controllable transparencies and control of these
parameters, as well as the technological implementation of the devices that have
been developed.

Let us note that the work performed at the FIAN [Physics Institute imeni P. N.
Lebedev, USSR Academy of Sciences] has made a definite contribution to the study of
the electrooptics of liquid crystals and to solving the problem of establishing

the research and clarifying the functional capabilities of liquid crystal control-
lable transparencies [2, 5-8, 14, 15, 17, 18, 36, 44, 52-55].

Chapter 2. Research on Phase Spatial Light Hodulation in Electrically
Controllable Liquid Crystal Structures

Results obtained can be formulated as follows:

1. A technique has been developed to create experimental samples of phase BUT
[electrically controllable transparencies] based on the orientation S-effect in
NZhK [nematic liquid crystals].

2. Based on analysis of the properties of the orientation S-effect in nematic
liquid crystals, the simplest principle has been suggested and realized for
parallel switching by voltages of two different frequencies of all elements in a
matrix addressable phase EUT [electrically controllable transparency], which
realizes binary sign-variable factorable functions (two-dimensional Halsh func-
tions, Gilbert masks, pseudorandom signals and others). The advantage of the
principle is the capability of separate adjustment of the initial transmission of
the controllable transparency elements and additional phase delay in the elements
switched on. This has permitted reducing approximately to five percent the
standard deviation of reproduction of the required function of transmission of
the controllable transparency.

3. Behavior of nematic liquid crystals in nonhomogeneous electrical fields during
quasigraduated variation of the potential at the boundary of the liquid crystal
layer has been studied for the first time theoretically and experimentally.

The lack of a threshold of the elctrooptical response was discovered experumentally
in planarly oriented liquid crystal layers with positive dielectric anisotropy
when components of an electrical field are present along the initial direction of
orientation of the molecules.

4. An anisotropic nature was established for the spatial transient characteristics
of the electrooptical response of the planarly oriented liquid crystal layers,
which permits drawing a conclusion on the anisotropy of the resolution of liquid
crystal instruments based on the S-effect. The dependency of the width of the
transient region (maximum spatial resolution) on liquid crystal parameters was
studied. The common character inherent to all field effects in nematic liquid
-crystals permits hoping the suggested theoretical model and experimental technique
will be useful in defining the resolution of liquid crystal instruments with
various methods of addressing which make use of field effects.

Chapter 3. Research on Functional Capabilities of Experimental Models of Matrix
Electrically Controllable Transparencies

The above results permit drawing the following conclusions:

1. An optoelectronic circuit with a phase matrix controllable transparency that
performs the Welsh transform of two-dimensional optical signals was proposed,
implemented and researched. Factors for expansion of the simplest images in the
walsh-Fourier series were determined experimentally.

2. Experimental models of phase matrix electrically controllable transparencies
were used for the first time in a circuit for the Hilbert transform of two-
dimensional optical circuits. Phase object hilbert transforms' were obtained in
which phase nonuniformities and boundaries of regions of constant phase were
visualized.

3. The calculations made and experimental results obtained demonstrate the
effectiveness of using phase controllable transparencies in circuits that realise
Halsh and Hilbert transforms. The basic advantage of these transparencies is
their capability of reproducing any phase relationships in transforms being made
and the capability of expeditious rearrangement of circuits.

Chapter 6. Research on Spatial Light Modulation in Photoconductor-Liquid Crystal
Structures

Here are the main results presented in this chapter:

1. For the first time. calculations were made of the photoelectrical parameters
of various types of structures based on liquid crystals and photoconductors to
optimize their electrooptical characteristics. Conditions were determined under
which maximum sensitivity of structures with modulation of transmitted and re-
flected light is achieved, and in particular, attention was paid to the importance
of matching the unpedences of the layers of liquid crystal and photoconductor
with regard to features of modulation characteristics of liquid crystals.

2. a record value was achieved for sensitivity of a liquid-crystal-photoconductor
structure, on the order of 0.1 microJoule/cmz, which corresponds to the maximum
depth of modulation of transmitted light. For structures with modulation of

reflected light, sensitivity was obtained according to similar criterion which

exceeds the value of 10-5 chmz. Threshold sensitivity of structures in both
cases was about 5 ' 10'8 J/cmz.

3. Holographic and projection techniques were suggested for measuring resolution
of FP-ZhK [photoconductor - liquid crystal] structures that allow obtaining com-
plete spatial-frequency characteristics of amplitude and phase modulations of
light in photoconductor-liquid-crystal structures. There was a good match of
results obtained by both techniques. In structures based on the hybrid effect,
resolution reaches the value of #6 lineshmn over a half-drop of the frequency-
contrsst response. In structures with the S-effect, resolution according to the
same criterion reaches the value of 115-120 lines/mm.

a. The anisotropic nature of resolution of devices based on orientation effects
in liquid crystals, mentioned in chapter 2. and the resolution dependency on the
parameters of the liquid crystal materials were confirmed. In structures with a
small value of dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystal. resolution of over 200
lines/mm was obtained over a half-drop in the frequency-contrast response.

5. Measured for the first time were the spatial transient characteristics of
photosensitive liquid-crystal structures, which were used to calculate the spatial-
frequency responses of a structure with the s-effect. It was shown that the
scattering function (pulse response) of the structure has a symmetrical shape;

consequently, there are no spatial phase-frequency distortions in the images
transformed by the structure.

Chapter 5. Optically Controllable Transparencies Based on Photoconductor-Liquid-
Crystal Structures in Optical Signal Conversion and Processing Circuits

Despite the broad functional capabilities of optically controllable transparencies
[OCT] noted in the review, until now photoconductor-liquid-cryatal [PC-LC]

F0!‘OFFHJAI.USE¢DNLY
structures have been used in optoelectronic circuits mainly just to amplify bright-
ness and transform images by type of radiation (for example, from noncoharent to
coherent) [3, A, 11]. The most significant achievements in this case are the

input of images of moving three-dimensional objects into the circuit of a holo-

graphic correlator. and an optical device for subtraction of images by using
two PC-LC type OCT's [11].

Given in this chapter are the results of experimental research on the functional
capabilities of PC-Lc type OCT models in circuits for optical processing of signals
and images. The main focus is on using these structures as reconfigurable spatial
filters. including the holographic type. The problem of analysis of the capabili-

ties of these circuits has also been raised with regard to parameters of the
PC-LC structures studied in this work.

5.1. Conversion and Amplification of Brightness of hmages

Tb evaluate the capabilities of performing various conversions of optical signals
by using the researched models of PC-Lc structures, an experimental model of an
optical conversion module was used. A diagram of this module is shown in fig. 39.

When various types of structures and various readout methods are used, this con-
verter can perform the following operations: 1) conversion of noncoherent optical
signals (images) into coherent; 2) conversion of images by changing the length

of the wave carrying the information of the light beam; 3) amplification of the
brightness of images in the blue-green region of the spectrum; 6) conversion of

amplitudinal into phassl contrasts; and 5) generation of the spatial spectra of
the images being converted.

The different modes of converter operation are demonstrated as an example in fig.
40. Fig. 00 a and b show conversion of images by wavelength with and without
inversion of contrast in structure with the S-effect. Fig. 40 c and d show the
result of amplification of the brightness of the images on one wavelength (661.6 nm)
and conversion of the images by type of radiation (noncoherent-coherent) in
structures with the hybrid effect.‘ The contrast in the converted images in fig.

40 a and b is 15:1, and in fig. 40 c and d, it is over 100:1. Tblerable image
brightness amplification is determined by absorption of light in the blocking layer
of cadmium telluride and may reach 30 dB (a thousand-fold in intensity) for
structure number four.

Structure number two based on the S-effect was used in the circuit for conversion
of amplitudinal into phasal contrast and generation of the spatial spectrum. Used
as the input signal was a diapositive (fig. 41a) with an image of a chessboard,
which matches the modified Halsh function Val (15,15) (see section 3.1). By means
of the structure with the S-effect, this amplitudinal signal is converted into a
signal with phase modulation, equal to the corresponding unmodified (true) Walsh
function, since the reading light, reflected from the illuminated regions of the
optically controllable transparency, acquires an additional phase shift by1ﬂ
Shown in fig. 61c is the spectrum of derived Walsh function Val (15, 15), generated
by lens 2 in spectral plane 10 of the optical circuit of the device when the
information is read by the radiation of an He-Ne laser. Proof of the truth of the
Ralsh function is the absence of a zero component in the center of the spectral
distribution of the intensities. This indicates the mean value of transmittance
of the optically controllable transparency is zero in this mode.

Conversion of the amplitudinal spatial into phasal modulation was also performed
by using the PC—LC structure number three with the hybrid effect. The source sig-
nal in the form of the Val (7, 7) function, the image of the working plane of the
converter and the spectrum of the Hal functions (7, 7) derived as a result of this
operation are shown in fig. 41d-f.

Thus, the operation of PC-LC structures as effective multifunctional image con-
verters has been demonstrated. Experiment results showed that the maximum sensi-
tivity and spatial resolution are achieved in image converters based on PC-LC
structures with the S-effect. By slight variation of the supply voltage in these
same structures, changing the mode of repetition for inversion of the image con-
trast is realized most effectively. however, the highest contrast and dynamic
range of conversion are achieved in structures based on the hybrid effect in liquid
crystals. In connection with this, it is advisable to use structures with the
S-effect to intensify images with low initial intensity, as well as in conversions
of images and spatial filters with phase modulation of reflected and transmitted
light. Structures with the hybrid effect, however, require higher intensities of
the input optical signals. But because of the threshold characteristic and high
contrast of the electrooptical response, these structures permit obtaining high
signal-to-noise ratios in the converted images.

5.2. Spatial Filtration of Optical Signals

Many of the major algorithms for optical information processing reduce to spatial
filtration operations (see section 1.3). The expeditious generation of the optical
transfer function of the filter that is required in this case can be performed by
using PC-LC structures [5, 6]. Thus, for example, the operation of a PC-LC struc-
ture with modulation of the transmitted light (see sections 4.1-4.3) as a tuneable

spatial filter (P?) in the simplest circuit for optical information processing was
studied.

An experimental train for spatial filtration is shown in fig. 1.2 and is intended
for visualization of phase contrast. The beam from laser 1 was expanded and col-
limated by telescopic system 2 and illuminated phase object 3, arranged in the
front focal plane of lens lo. The distribution of the complex amplitudes in its
rear focal plane, where the tuneable filter is positioned, is a Fourier spectrua
of the function of the complex transmittance of phase object 3. Under the affect
of the exciting radiation from argon laser 9 with a wavelength of 514.5 m,

focused by lens 6, in the tuneable filter there occurred a shift by nl2 of the
phase of the modulated light in the region of zero spatial frequencies of the
phase object spectrum. Lens 5 effected an inverse Fourier transform, and in output
plane 8, an image of the phase object was observed in which the nonuniformities of
the phase changed into the nonuniformities of intensity [71, 77]. The voltage in
the PC-LC structure was selected so that the amplitude contrast of the image in the
output plane was maximum. ‘

Used as the phase object in the experiment was a quartz base with a film of tin
dioxide, in which grooves with a width of about 50 micrometers (see section 2.1)
were etched by the method of photolithography. Used as the tuneable f iltsr was a
structure with a photoconducting layer of cadmium sulfide (masher four from

table 1) and with a planarly oriented layer of liquid crystal number one (see
table 2) with a thickness of 10 micrometers.

A picture of the vizuali'zed phase object is shown in fig. 43a [not reproduced].
For comparison, fig. 43b shows the image of the output plane of the optical train

with no exciting radiation, and fig. 43c [not reproduced] shows the image of the
same phase object visualized by using a Foucault cutter installed in the frequency
plane instead of the tuneable filter.

Thus, the capability of using PC-LC structures as tuneable spatial filters has been
demonstrated, particularly in a train for visualization of the phase contrast.

The optoelectronic circuit in question can easily be retuned to implement any type
of spatial filtration by feeding an appropriate control optical signal to the tune-
able filter. Thus, for example, a Hilbert transform can be obtained provided the
complex transmittance of the tunesble filter equals

R Us. ’v) - _ I‘ll Us) 880 (It) (54)

This means that when the exciting radiation is switched on and off in the first and
third quadrants of the spectral plane in the output plane of the circuit, either an
usage of the source spatial signal or its Hilbert transform . (see section 3.2)
will be generated. This circuit permits using for recognition of an image at the
same time its Fourier and Bilbert transforms, thanks to which in certain cases,
recognition efficiency is increased considerably [77]. A sunilar circuit was used
in [40, #2] to generate a (Van der Luegt) matched filter.

5.3. Holographic Correlator with Converter of Input hnages and luneable Spatial
Filter Based on Photoconductor - Liquid-Crystal Structures

Correlation comparison of input signals is a powerful method of processing optical
signals to detect and identify objects in images [39, 71]. A major problem in de-
veloping coherent optical correlators is expeditious input of information, as well
as retuning of holographic matched filters when reference signals change (see
chapter 1). Both these problems were solved in this work by using optically con-
trollable transparencies based on PC-LC strructures, distinguished by rather high
sensitivity and fine resolution (see chapter 4).

Simplest and most convenient from the viewpoint of using reflective-type optically
controllable transparencies [OCT] is the holographic correlator circuit with com-
bined conversion of the input and reference signal (KS?) [#1, #2]. An experimental
circuit of this correlator is shown in in fig. 66. In it, noncoherent light source
1 illuminated photofilm 2 with two images recorded on it that are the optical sig-
nals being compared, designated by f(x, y) and g(x, y). where x and y are the
spatial coordinates in the plane of trasnparency 2. Lens 3 generated an image of
the input transparency in the plane of the photoconducting layer of the OCT 4.
which was used in the mode of a converter of input signals by type of radiation
(noncoherent-coherent).

Used as the model of transparency b was PC-LC structure number three with the
hybrid effect. Information from input converter h was read in the reflected con-
vergent beam of the He-Cd laser, generated by telescopic system 6. OCT 4 was made
with prism 7 in the form of an optical module (fig. 39).

In the focal plane of the optical reading system, where tunesble spatial filter 5
was placed, the spatial spectrum of the converted input signal was generated.

Used as filter 5 was PC-Lc structure number one based on the S-effect. Ihe electro-
opticsl response of filter 5 is proportional to the distribution of intensities in
the spectrum of the input signal. Thus, recorded in the plane of OCT 5 is a holo-
gram that is read in the reflected convergent beam of red light (radiation of the
He-Ne laser). The distribution of amplitudes in focal plane 9 of the read circuit
contains components proportional to the functions of autocorrelation and cross-
correlation of signals f and g [41, 42].

Major characteristics of the correlator are resolution of the input transparency
and spatial filter. Requirements for filter resolution are usually evaluated pro-
ceeding from the conditions of spatial division in the output plane of the circuit
of signals of autocorrelation and cross-correlation [b1, 62]. It has been shown
[43] that the required resolution of the material of the filter, evaluated by the

maxinun spatial frequency a.“ of the light field recorded in the hologram, is no

higher in the circuit for the traditional (Van der Luegt) correlator (fig. 3) than
in the KSP [correlator with combined conversion] circuit.

It is evident that the value of .5“, equals the halfwidth of the filter transfer
function [41, 43]

ﬁn, a: AIME. (5.2)

where A is the full width of the input signal, 11 is the wavelength of the light
generating the hologram, and F1 is the focal distance. However, because of aper-

ture limitations of real OCT's, their resolution should be described not by the
maximum spatial frequency, but by the total number of resolvable elements:

N, - 2e...>.,F./o = 2.4/6 =- 21V... (5.3)
where d is the size of the minimise resolvable element of the input signals and "A
is the total masher of resolvable elements of the input signal (at length A).

Table 5 shows the basic calculated relations associating the dimensions wt. and "8

of signals f and g respectively with the required manber of resolvable filter ele-
ments (in the unidimensional case) for the (Van der Luegt) and KSP schemes.

Since in the recording scheme for the (Van der Luegt) filter there is a point
reference source R. the useful dimension of the input converter here equals

W :- max (W‘; W,} (5.4)

(let us designate the corresponding number of resolvable elements of the input
converter by N").

In a xoc [expansion unknown] scheme, the useful dimension of the OCT always equals
the full width of the signal A (with regard to the required interval between the
signals f and 3). Therefore, the required number of resolvable filter elements
in the K8? scheme is just twice the total nusber of elements in the input con-
verter in any relations between Hi and "8. But in the (Van dar Luegt) scheme, the
value of NF may range from 2 "H to 6 N“ as a function of the relationship between
the dimensions "f and "8 (see table 5). From the viewpoint of information theory,

this doubled number of resolvable elements (i.e. quantity of information) in the
filter compared to the input signal is due to the necessity of transfer by the fil-
ter of both the positive and the negative frequencies in the spectra of the

input signal [41].

The found relation (5.3) between the values "A and "F permits using single-type

OCT's in the input and frequency planes in the scheme, and the usable area of the
filter can be increased by increasing the scale of the input signal spectrum.
Thus, for example, in the experiment, the dimension H of the input signal in plane

A was about 1 mm, while the distance F1 was about 400 am. As a result, the value
of gm,, was just about 17 lineshum, which is far less than the maximum resolu-

tion of structure number one and indicates the possibility of increasing the dimen-
sion of the input signal. Let us note that the total nmnber of resolvable elements
in a line of an image generated by the PC-LC structure number one (filter) can be
over 2000. This same value for structure number three (input converter) is about
1000 which meets the requirements of matching, expressed by formula (5.3).

a hologram is generated in plane 5, and observed in the scheme output plane are
two eccentric signals proportional to the function of cross correlation of the
images being studied. The ratio of intensities of the peak of the autocorrelation
function to its side lobes was not less than 10:1 for identical letters and about
1.521 for different letters (X and 0).

A major advantage of the correlator scheme described is that it maintains its
operating capability during the effect of brief mechanical disturbances, like
shaking, jolts, etc. This is due to the absence of long-term storage and the
effects of storage in the filter material associated with it. As a result, mechan-
ical disturbances affecting the circuit during generation of the hologram do not

cause irreversible damage to the filter being recorded. In experiments, the time
for restoration of diffraction effectiveness after removal of the mechnical dis-
turbance matched in value the structure response time (about 20-40 ms).

5.4. Spectral Analysis and Correlation Comparison of Television ﬁnages

Television (TV) systems are one of the most effective and widespread means of sens-
ing, transmitting and reproducting images. Combining TV and coherent optical
information processing methods permits creating hybrid systems for expeditious pro-
cessing of signals and images with extremely broad functional capabilities [4, 48].
In connection with this, in this section, the possibility is investigated of using
PC-LC structures as devices for input and spatial filters in coherent optical
schemes for processing TV images.

The holographic correlator scheme shown in fig. 44 can easily be adapted to process
TV images if slide 2 is replaced by input signals from a cathode ray tube [CRT].
However, difficulties do occur in using this scheme, that are associated with the
need of using blue light for reading information from input converter 4. Also,

the lack of a blue-absorbing layer of cadmium telluride (see section 4.4) in the
Pc-LC strcutures used reduces the dynamic range of input converter 4 and the
diffraction effectiveness of filter 5. Because of this, new schemes were proposed

in which this difficulty was overcome by using the capabilities of television
technology.

In the scheme shown in fig. 46, the same model nuber five of the was structure
was used as the input converter and spatial filter. This scheme was also the
holographic correlator with combined conversion of the iamges, the correlation of
which it is neccsssary to determine (see section 5.3). The source image I (slide),
containing the reference signal f (x, y) and that to eb identified g (x, y), was
sensed by television camera 2 and sent through sums: 3 to the input of television
projector lo. From the screen of the projection CRT, type 13 LR 11 B, the image was
projected by lens 5 onto the photoconductor layer of optically controllable trans-
parency [OCT] 6. The converted image was read by radiation from laser 7. Glen
prism 8 was used as the polarizer and analyzer in the reading scheme.

Telescopic system 9 generated a converging reading been, part of which was

reflected from semitransparsnt mirror 10 and focused in the plane of the photo-
cathode of television camera 11. Since there must be space between signals f and g
to separate the correlation signals in space (see section 5.3), part of the useful
area fo the frame and the OCT remain free. Installed behind mirror 10 was diaphragm

12 that passes only the reading light reflected from the OCT sections occupied by
input signals.

Thus, television camera 11 sensed the combined spatial spectrua of signals f and g,
which permitted using the scheme in the mode of a spectrum analyzer. The signal
from television camera 11 went to the second input of the susmer. As a result,
the image fo the combined spectrum: (hologram) was projected from .the CRT screen‘ to
the free section of the photoconductor layer, in the space between signals f and g,
which was sued as a tuneable holographic filter. The light reflected from this
section was isolated by mirror 13 and diaphragm 16 and focused in the plane of
screen 15. Here a Fourier transform was generated of the transmission function of
the filter that contains components proprotional t0'the functions of autocorrela-
tion (in the center of the field) and of cross-correlation (on the sides) of the
signals f and g. GI this same screen, lens 16 generated a check image of the

OCT working area.

The arrangement of the spatial spectrum between the input signals imposes limits
on the maximum number of resolvable elements in signals f and g and on their
relative position. From table 4, it is easy to find the relations between the
dimensions H of the input signals (let us assuna Hf-ws-H) and the minimum size of

a resolvable element A. in them in the final sizes of the minim element in the
image projected from the CRT screen. The relation between the numberof resolvable
elements of the input plane and the filter in this case can be notaced as

(2W + B)/A - 0.5 3/6,

where B is the width of the space between signals f and g. Then
a _ 25 (1 + 2W/B).

Thus, the value ofAvaries from 2 8 when HIB —9 0 to 6 8 when "-3 (B can not be
less than H from the condition of spatial separation of correlation signals in the
output plane). This means that in the scheme under consideration, the CRT
resolution in the sections occupied by input signals cannot be fully utilized.

This shortcoming can be overcome by using different OCT's as the input converter
and filter (see section 5.3) or when an OCT with a resolution margin is used, by
projecting the images of input signals and the filter from different CRT's.

Used as input signals in the experiments were slides with an image of machine-
printed letters with a size relation of B - 2”. With that, A - (05 , which is
entirely sufficient for accurate reproduction of the letters. The images of the
input and correlation signals, as well as the spectra obtained from the screens of
the video monitor units are shown in fig. 47. The signal-to-noise ratio in the
correlation plane did not exceed 5:1 with an estimated ratio of the correlation
function peak to side lobe intensity of about 10:1. This is due primarily to the

increase in noise and distortion of the signal when it passes doubly through the
TV system.

Fig. 48. Correlator scheme with two CRT's and OCT's

Higher capacity was achieved in the correlator scheme shown in fig. 48. In it, the
. input signals and filter were generated in different experimental OCT models (5 and
6) from the screens of two different CRT's (3 and 5). However, information in both
OCT's was read by the radiation from the same 18-38 lie-Ne laser 1. Input converter
lo operated in the mode of maplitude (image from teleprc jector 3) to phase contrast
conversion. since binary masks based on H-series [7, 8, 56] with known correlation
properties were used as test input signals 1 in the scheme. The OCT 4 operating
mode was selected so that the mean value of transmission was reduced to the minimua,
to which corresponds the minimua intensity of light in the region of zero spatial
frequencies of the spectra of the generated signal. This intensity was

measured by photodetector 14.

The hologram filter was generated in the plane of the photo cathode of television
camera 7 by the radiation reflected from the plane of OCT 10. item camera 7, the
signal went to the second teleprojector 5 with a ZLKZB CRT and from its screen was
projected to the OCT-filter 6, similar to transparency la. The camera 8 photo
cathode was placed in the correlation plane, and the signal from it went to the
input of the 81-57 oscillograph 9 with a line signal separator, which allowed
measuring the correlation maximum 1m and side lobe I. intensity ratio.

The test signals 1 had 32 x 32 elements and were a two-dimensional recording of the
H-series with a length of 1023 elements (with the addition of one element).

The calculated ratio of In”. exceeds 103 [78].

In the experiment, the correlation maximum exceeded noise by about 68. with that,
OCT Noise was about 0.3 percent of the correlation maximum, while the telecamera
noise was not over 0.1 percent according to the same criterion. At the same time,
attenuation of the zero spatial frequency in the spectrum of ”he input signal was
about 120. Consequently, the main source of degradation of the correlation maximum
was concentrated in the aberations (raster distortions), which in the first tele-
projector 3 reached 7.5 percent over the area of the input signal (corresponding to
over a 20-fold degradation [79]).

Thus, the capability of correlation comparison of TV signals in optoelectronic
circuits with PC-LC OCT's was demonstrated. The proposed and studied schemes for
converting TV images can also be used to perform other spatial filtration opera-
tions, for instance, picking out object contours, increasing the contrast of major
or minor details and others. Hith that, the lack of phase-frequency distortions in
the spatial structure of the converted wave fronts is very important (see section
6.5). Also, the phase nonuniformities, unavoidable in other types of OCT's, can be

reduced to the minimum with good processing of the surfaces orienting the liquid
crystals [9].

The results presented above can be summarized as follows.

1. The capability of effective use of OCT's based on the PC-LC structure as
multifunctional image converters has been demonstrated experimentally. With that,
over loo-fold intensification of the brightness of the converted images was
achieved. Calculations showed that the intensification factor can be extended to
several thousands. Contrast of the images converted by the PC-LC structure with
the hybrid effect exceeded 100:1.

A structure based on the S-effect permits easy switching from the mode of
repetition of the contrast to inversion and back.

The capability of converting amplitude spatial modulation to phase by using struc-
tures based on the hybrid and S-effects was demonstrated.

2. PC-LC structures were used for the first time as tuneable spatial filters in a
coherent optical device for visualization of phase contrast and in a promising cor-
relator scheme with combined conversion of the input and reference signals, in
which the PC-LC structure was also used as the input converter. Analysis of holo-
graphic correlator schemes shows that the total required number of resolvable ele-
ments of the filter in a scheme with a generalized hologram is just double the num-
ber of elements in the input plane. This permits using single—type OCT's in the
input and spectral planes of such a scheme.

3. The possibilities were studied for using PC-LC structures as devices for input
and a spatial filter in the holographic correlator scheme with combined conversion
of television images. A new correlator scheme that uses one OCT was proposed and

studied. It was shown that degradation of the correlation maximum in this scheme

was due primarily to raster distortions in the TV system.

a. It was shown that the PC-LC structure enables the capability of normal operation
of a holographic scheme with a spatial filter under the conditions of mechanical
disturbances. This important advantage, caused by the nature of storage in the
structure investigated, is realized most fully in the correlator scheme selected.

Conclusions

The main results of this work are summarized as follows.

1. The behavior of nematic liquid crystals in nonuniform electrical fields has

been studied theoretically and experimentally for the first time. Confirmed experi-
mentally was the hypothesis on the lack of a threshold of the electrooptical
response in the planarly oriented layers of nematic liquid crystals with positive

dielectric anisotropy with a component of the electrical field along the initial
direction of molecular orientation.

2. The anisotropic nature of the spatial distribution of the electrical response
of the plansrly orientet liquid-crystal layers was established. and the dependence
of the resolution of the liquid-crystal layer on its parameters was investigated.
It was shown that resolution increases considerably with the decrease in
dielectric anistropy of the liquid crystal.

3. The dependence of the electrooptical characteristics of photosensitive liquid-

crystal - semiconductor structures on the structure material parameters was studied
theoretically and experimentally. The important role of matching impedances of the
layers of photoconductor and liquid crystal was shown for attaining maximum sensi-

tivity. As a result of structure optimization, a record value of sensitivity,

about 0.1 microJoule/cm2 (with maximum depth of amplitude modulation of the light)
and resolution of more than 120 lines/mm were achieved.

4. Holographic and projection techniques were offered to measure PC-Lc structural
resolution, which permit obtaining together the total spatial-frequency character-
istics of the phase light modulation in these structures. As a result of these
measurements, it was shown that the scattering function (pulse response) of these
structures has a symmetrical shape, indicating the lack of phase-frequency distor-
tions in the wave fronts converted by the structures.

5. Based on analysis of results of research on the electrooptical properties of
plansrly oriented layers of nematic liquid crystals, the method of addressing of
the matrix light modulator, which reproduces with high accuracy the binary sign-
variable factorsble transmission factors (two-dimensional Halsh functions, the
Hilbert "phase cutter," pseudorsndom signals and others), was proposed and
realized in experiments for the first time.

Optical schemes with matrix-addressable phase transparencies, that realize Halsh
and Hilbert transforms, were proposed and researched theoretically and
experimentally for the first time.

6. Demonstrated experimentally was the capability of using effectively PC¢LC
strcutures as multifunctional image converters, and appropriate recosnendstions
were generated for specific types of structures and forms of conversion.

7. Demonstrated experimentally for the first time was the capability of using
PC-Lc strcutares with phase light modulation es tuneable spatial filters in a scheme
for visualization of phase contrast and in the promising scheme for a holographic
correlator with combined conversion of the input and reference signals. Analysis

of the correlator scheme selected showed the expediency of using single-type OCT's
in the input and spectral planes of this scheme. Correlation comparison of tele-
vision images was also performed in it in real time.

Thus, as a result of research carried out, the effectiveness of spatial light
modulation in electrically and optically addressable liquid-crystal structures was
demonstrated. The promise of nematic liquid crystals as materials for electrically
and optically controllable transparencies--image converters, spatial filters and
coding elements--was demonstrated.

In many practically important schemes for optical information processing, trans-
parencies based on liquid crystlas have a number of indisputable advantages over
other types of controllable transparencies. Primarily, these advantages are: high
sensitivity and effectiveness of light conversion with small supply voltages and
powers, relatively high resolution and the lack of phase-frequency distortions in
the converted optical signals. It has been shown that the advantages of liquid-
crystal controllable transparencies are especially clearly manifested when they are
used as spatial filters and coding elements. In the process, processing rates
correponding to the television standard are easily achieved.

The research performed lays the required foundation for formulating experimental
design work to develop electrically and optically controllable transparencies to
use them in real optical information processing systems. Based on the liquid-

crystal strcutures investigated, spatial light modulators can be developed with the
following parameters:

more than 108 resolvable elements (for OCT's);
.threshold sensitivity no worse than 10"8 J/cm2 (for OCT's) with maximum amplitude

modulation no worse than 10'5 Hertz;

response time no more than 20 ms, and full cycle time no more than 30 ms;

amplitude contrast no worse than 150;

depth of phase modulation to 2 or more; and

dynamic range of intensification of image brightness (for OCT's) no less than 30 dB.

In each specific information rpocessing scheme, the highest efficiency of operation
of these controllable transparencies can be achieved by selecting optimal parameters
of liquid crystals applied and the type of electrooptical effect in them that best
meet scheme requirements. In doing so, a parameter group can even be improved by
reducing the requirements for another group. Thus, for example, PC-LC strcutural
sensitivity can be increased by reducing resolution, and effective contrast inver-
sion is achieved by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio.

bet us note that only the first steps have been made in terms of using liquid-
crystal structures in information processing schemes. Systematic research is
needed on materials and particularly on methods and schemes for information proces~
sing; development of optoelectronic systems using controllable transparencies for
information input, conversion and coding is required. It is no exaggeration to say
that spatial light modulators based on liquid crystals will play a prominent role
in these systems.

[Excerpts] Introduction

Controllable transparencies (spatial-time light modulators) are key elements in
optical storage and peripheral devices, coherent optical processors and other major
assemblies in information and computing systems that are being developed. They are
used for input and conversion of two-dimensional information arrays [1, 2]. The
functional role of controllable transparencies (UT) [CT's] hers is quite varied.
Based on them, one can perform depiction of information (displays, including pro-
jectional), input and output, generation and conversion of digital arrays, realiza-
tion of logic operations, coding and identification of optical signals, etc.

The efficiency of applying a CT in systems for storage and optical processing of
information is primarily determined by the properties of its operating material.
In turn, selection of a material for a CT with some concrete function is governed
by the aggregate of the properties of the material most suitable for a given CT
application. In the process, the transparency material must meet the following
basic requirements: highest efficiency in conversion of the optical signal

01 I Iout/Iin’ where [in is signal intensity at input of transparency, and Iout is

the modulated component of the output signal) with maximum optical contrast and
depth of modulation; high sensitivity to the control signal to reduce energy inputs
for switching of transparency elements; a switching speed providing the needed rate
for input/output and conversion of the entire array (for the majority of applica-
tions, this rate must not be below the television standard: 1/30 s for 500 x 500
resolvable elements); availability of the storage effect (long—term storage requir-
ing a special signal for returning the material to the initial state, or relaxation
storage), i.e. the capability of maintaining tne switched-on state for the time
needed to read the entire information array; absence of fatigue during the CT opera-

ting period (more than 10“ hours or 108-10lo switchings); adaptability to manufac-
ture of the CT's that best incorporate the advantages of the optical media
selected for them.

Using materials in electrically controllable transparencies [BOT] intended for
processing digital intonation dictates the necessity of their having threshold
properties or a substantially nonlinear characteristic of the switched element.
This permits raising the signal-to-noise ratio and reducing the probability of
false switching of the 301‘ elements. This characteristic is especially important
in matrix addressing of the elements by electrical voltage, since it permits reduc-
ing the so-called "cross-effect" to the minimum. lhtrix addressing (also called
line) is effected over the minimum: umber of channels ZN, where

N2 is the nuber of BCT elements that may vary from 102 to 106 as a function of
its purpose.

A large nunber of media have been suggested as the operating material for ECT's.

A detailed analysis of them, with regard to specific applications, is given in [2].
Based on this analysis, electrooptical TsTSL [lanthanum modified lead zirconate-
titanste - LHLZT] ceramics are the most promising materials for ECT's with matrix
and individual addressing.

indeed, they can be used to develop high-speed (with a frequency band (A 3 1 MHz)
and highly efficient delves (with close to 100 percent efficiency in light signal
conversion). WT ceramics are adaptable to manufacture and production costs are
low (compared to monocrystala). They have satisfactory optical contrast, suffi-
cient spatial resolution, a wide range of operating temperatures and a large
operating aperture. They are also noted for diversity of optical effects that
determines a broad range of possible applications [3, lo].

TsTSL-ceramics is a polycrystal of lead zirconate-titanata Pb(2r, Ti) 03, alloyed
with lanthanum The following designation is used in the literature for ceramics
as a function of their technological composition: X/A/B, where A indicates the
percentage content of lead zirconate, B the percentage content of lead titanste,
and X the percentage content of lanthanum. It is very important that a change in
the ratios of components in ceramics causes a substantial change in their
physical properties.

Electrooptical ceramics are made by the hot-molding method that has a number of
substantial advantages over conventional ceramic technology. A major indicator of
quality of sintered polycrystal (ceramic) materials is density, upon which the
basic electrophysical parameters depend. In hot molding, because of the simul-
taneous application of high temperature and pressure, material density increases
significantly, approaching the theoretical [5]. Hot-molded specimens have a uni-
form structure, which facilitates the best packing of crystallitea [6].
Optimization of the ausospheric sintering process improves the transmittance of
Dill! ceramics [7].

Conclusion

The main results of this work can be earned up as follows:

1. to analysis was made of the works on the study of electrooptical ceramics and
their application in optoelectronic devices. We studied the npticophysical proper-
ties of LMLZT ceramics with compositions of 8/65/35 and 9/65/35 under queeistatic
and dynamic conditions during the effect on them of electrical and optical signals.

shows that the greatest change of double refraction, equal to 2.2 - 10’3, occurs
in the case of the cross electrooptical effect.

2. For the edge effect, the relation of change of double refraction under the
effect of an electrical field was studied for the first time, and the efficiency
of electrooptical conversion was determined. The maximum double refraction change

was 1.2 - 10'3 with an optical contrast of 12:1. Studied for the edge effect for
the first time was the distribution of vectors of polarization in the switched
regions of paraelectric and ferroelectric ceramics; it was shown that in ferrOo
electric csramics, the orientation of the ferroelectric domains is the result of
the mechanical effect associated with the inverse piezo effect, while in para-
electric ceramics, the directly applied electric field is responsible for the
edge effect.

3. The effect of asymmetrical deformation was offered in which the double refrac-
tion change was

1.4 ' 10'3 with an optical contrast of 50:1; increasing the electrical field in
this case does not cause irreversible polarization of the switchable regions of
the ferroelectric ceramics.

6. Investigated for the first time was the mechanism of the effect of a variable
electrical field of small amplitude on LMLZT ferroelectric ceramics, which brings
the specimen from the electrically polarized to the thermally depolarized state.
Two interrelated processes were considered: disorientation of the previously
aligied domains of the ferroelectric ceramics and heating up of the specimen in
the repolarization process. A satisfactory match of estimated data with experi-
mental was obtained. The method of the effect of a variable electrical field per-
mitted realizing optically isotropic orientations of the ferroelectric domains,
which caused an increase of the optical contrast of the electrooptical effects

to a value greater than 100:1.

5. Suggested was the method of creating by an electrical field an optically iso—
tropic state of the ferroelectric ceramics with a uniform 90-degree reorientation
of the ferroelectric domains to a direction perpendicular to the specimen plane
which prevents irreversible polarization of the switchable regions.

6. The basic capability of making use of the cross electroooptical effect in
LHLZT ceramics in matrix addressable controllable transparencies; this enabled a
considerable gain in light conversion efficiency (over 50 percent) while keeping
the high rate of information array generation inherent to the matrix method of
transparency element switching.

7. Based on the edge effect in ferroelectric ceramics, we developed and studied a
model of a high-speed electrically controllable transparency with a capacity of

32 x 32 elements, that provided information array generation time of 160 micro-
seconds and erasure of 100 microseconds with a voltage pulse amplitude of up to

250 V; light conversion efficiency was 15 percent in the mode of matrix addressing
of all transparency elements; optical contrast at light wavelength of 633 nm
exceeded 100:1 in the wide angular range of transparency illumination of 120'.
Based on paraelectric ceramics, we developed and studied a high-speed unidimensional
spatial-time light modulator which is characterized by light modulation efficiency

to 100 percent in the modulation frequency ‘nznd to 1 MHz. The parameters of these
and other experimental models of high-speed electrically controllable transparencies
developed on the basis of LHLZT ceramics are given in the table.

General conclusion: the results obtained allow drawing the conclusion that electro-
optical ceramics are some of the most pronising materials for high-speed amplitude
and phase electrically controllable transparencies; the research performed is the
necessary basis for organizing experimental design work on BCT development to make
use of them in real information processing systems.

Along with this, further study of the physical properties of polycrystal LHLZT
ceramics is required. For example, there is still no strict theoretical or analytic
model of the double-refraction properties of polycrystal LHLZT ceramics that consi-
ders the diffraction and scattering of light on the individual domrins and bound-
aries of the granules. The interrelated pyroelectric and piezoopt cal phenomena
have not been studied tehoretically and experimentally. There is no theory for the
photovoltaic effect. A profound understanding of the physical properties of poly-
crystal LMLZT ceramics will allow finding optimal methods for control of their
electrooptical properties, and raise even higher the efficiency, speed and sensi-
tivity to the control signal of the controllable transparencies based on them.

FOR‘OFFKiﬁi.USE(N§LY
Needed too is further purposeful research on improving the physical and technologi-
cal processes of making LHLZI ceramics with reliable monitoring of their composi-
tinn at all stages of preparation, which will provide the capability of fine re-
producible production of specimens with properties specified in advance. In doing
so, worthy of attention is the possibility of obtaining new interesting properties
in LHLZT systems made in the planar structure by the high-frequency spraying method.

[Excerpts] Introduction

ﬁxch attention has been paid recently to optical methods of information processing.
Applying optical methods in new-generation computers will undoubtedly have the

effect of increasing their speed and throughput and raising noise-isnunity and
reliability.

‘lhe advantages of assemblies with optical information processing now being proposed
are bound to show up most fully in the future with the development of computers
with a substantially new organization designed for application of coherent optics.
Hovever, a number of assemblies for an optical computer, such ss information input]
output units and reversible optical storage units can also be successfully applied
in modern computers in various classes for various purposes.

Reversible optical storage units (ZU) with a capacity exceeding 108 bits and high
parallelism in processing, retrieval of and access to any part of stored informa-
tion (~1 microsecond) may be of interest for use in modern computer equipment.
Development of this optical storsgs unit is possible at the current state-of-the-
art if the medium, the reversible carrier of information, meets a number of rather
severe requirements: the necesssry sensitivity to the light effect, spatial
resolution, speed, etc. [1].

In this work, we have studied the capability of reversible optical recording with
HIS structures of the metal-silicon nitride-silicon oxide-silicon type

(Ne - SiBNa - SiO2 - Si), the so-called HNOS structures (metal-nitride-oxide-semi-
conductor).

MNOS structures are widely applied for reversible electrical storage, have a high

swicthing speed of IV 10'7s and can store recorded information for several thousands
of hours after power is disconnected [2]. The planar technology for manufacture of
the structures is canvenient and well developed. HNOS structures operate at room
temperatures and consequently require no special vacuum low-temperature systems.

The following is required to study the capabilities of developing an optical

storage unit with these structures: 1) further study of the physical mechanisms
determining the processes of accumulation, storage and readout of information in
these structures; 2) research on the effect of light on switching of the structures;
3) study of parameters of teh elements in an optical storage unit and the physical
factors limiting their maximum values; and 4) development of a structural scheme
for optical storage.

This work is devoted to an examination of these questions.

The experiments performed in this work have shown that the energy of a light pulse
from a semiconductor laser made with Gene crystal is sufficient for simultaneous re-

cording of an array of 103 bits of information within 10'7s.

A structural scheme for an optical storage unit with high capacity («w 108 bits)
has now been developed in which information is recorded in binary code and in
arrays (just es in holographic storage units). Light addressing for individual
pages is used in the scheme, which enables rapid access to any part of the recorded
information [32]. we used a photoconductor - ferromagentic film structure to
store information.

Using a photolayer and the need of using a magnetic field limit the speed of this
unit to the millisecond range. He examined the possibility of using the basic
ideas of this scheme to implement an optical storage unit based on HIS structures

[33].

Using an M18 structure as a storage medium permits developing a high-speed optical
storage unit highly sensitive to the control light.

A block diagram of the storage is shown in fig. 101. The main components are:
laser, optical addressing system and the storage medium. The scheme is based on
using a gas laser with minor (close to diffraction) beam divergence. Powerful
argon lasers have now been developed that provide continuous rsdiation with a
power to S H with beam divergence not over 0.5 millirad (for example. the ILA
series lasers from the GDR).

The light-sensitive medium is divided into individual sections--chips--sach having
one common control electrode. Information is coded by electrical pulses and
recorded only in the illuminated section of the chip. During readout. the signal
being recorded is also determined only by the state of the illuminated cell of

the chip.

Each storage chip is addressed by one beam that moves to another call on this same
chip when the deflector is switched.

The optical addressing system consists of a deflector and light beam splitter
focusing the optics. The splitter is intended for parallel reference to many
cells in the storage media: placed on the various chips.

The laser beam is split according to the following scheme.

At each deflector position, the light bean is split into 610 beans forming a matrix
of 8 x 8 beans.

Splitting is performed by the system of double refraction prisms made of calcite
arranged in series over the beam course. The focusing optics generate on the
cards of the storage medias 8 x 8 light circles with a diameter of 6 microns equi-
distant from each other. The storage medium chips are arranged so that one
storage cell is illusinated on each of them.

Thus, 64 bits of information can be recorded simultaneously on a card. Beam
splitters are placed between the focusing objective and storage medium to increase
the capacity of each page. Thus, identical images are obtained on several cards
of the storage media. However, in the general case. a different numeric code
goes to each of the cards. Page capacity increases in proportion to the number of
cards used. The number of storage cells in each chip equals the nunber of deflec-
tor positions, and the total capacity of the storage device is defined as

No - "PNBNV where ”8 is the number of storage cells in each chip, “P is the num-

ber of chips on each storage card and "k is the nunber of storage cards.

It is easy to show that the capacity of one storage card N1 can be represented by
the expression [34]

N1 -= (x. tum“)! iovn'.

where D is the size of a side of a square storage card (let us assune that the
diameter of the focusing objective Dob - m); f is the objective focal distance,

his the light wavelength, ‘30 is the diameter of the light beds incident on the
focusing objective after the first splitter (76 is a nmeric factor < l), xib is

the storage cell spacing factor within a chip (xib - b/sb and b is the storage cell
diameter), sb is the step of the layout of the storage cells within a chip, xic is
the factor for filling a storage card with chips (xic - c/sc), c is the size of a
chip side and .c is the step of the layout of chips on a storage card.

lhe given expression for capacity of a card matches the corresponding expression
that defines the capacity of a holographic main storage unit [35].

However, in contrast to holographic schemes for a storage unit with a fixed objec-
tive dimter, the capacity of the device under consideration increases rapidly
with an increase in the nunber of best splitters

N - “12", where k is the masher of beam splitters on the path of any beam from the

objective to the corresponding storage card. At the ease time, it is true that the
required laser power increases as wall.

Given in [36] is an estimate of various alternatives for building a storage device

according to the scheme under consideration to optimize the storage device
pareseters.

The main results of the estimate are shown in the table. ‘lhe data cited indicate

that with an attainable laser power, it is possible to build a storage device
with a capacity

exceeding 108 bits.

The functional capabilities of the optical storage device in question correspond in
many parameters to those of modern reversible holographic storage devices:
recording and readout of information in arrays. the fundamental capability of rapid
addressing for the different information arrays while sacnning over the structure
by light, and recording of information with high density.

At the same time, this scheme for an optical storage device using HIS structures
has advantages too. The sensitivity of H18 structures exceeds considerably that of
the majority of holographic reversible media [1, 36]. 1111s permits operating with

information arrays of 10“ bits within units of microseconds, while using series
lasers. ‘lhe problems associated with development of high-speed transparencies with

a capacity of 10" bits and matrices of photodetectora with the sure capacity are
superfluous in the scheme under consideration.

The shortcomings of this storage device are the high requirements for precision of
execution of the individual elements and the adjustment of them.

In the suggested storage device, a certain amount of electrical power also has to
used to write, read and erase information, in addition to the light energy
defined above. It follows from the physics of the phenomenon that the highest
amount of electricity has to be used in writing and erasing information when the
capacitance of the insulation layer has to be charged practically to the peak of
the voltage recording pulse. The electricity stored in the process, accounted for
by a unit of structural surface area, equals

3 01 - kclvz.

where C1 is the capacitance of a square centimeter of the insulation layer and V is

the peak of the recording pulse.

NEH COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY EXHIBITEI AT LEIPZIG PAIR
Hoscow PRIBORY I SISTER“ UPRAVLENIYA in Russian No 1, Jan 82 pp 12-13

[Article by engineer-economist H.‘ Grﬁnewald, GDR: "New Articles of
Computer Technology from m Kombinat Robotron"]

[Text] VBB Kombinat Robotron exhibited a number of new articles of decentral-
ized computer technology at the Leipzig spring fair. The enterprise had shown

some of the articles of this program at the fair earlier.

These articles are based on the K1520 (SH 1626) and K1620 or K1630 (SH 1630)
microprocessors .

The A6602 Comercial Base Computer System

System A6602 is a small computer unit based on a K1630 microprocessor, which
differs from the K1620 microprocessor because its internal storage capacity of
128 K words (256 K bytes) is four times larger. It is possible to connect in
an arithmetic processor for high-speed processing of 32-bit and 66-bit numbers
with floating points as well as l6-bit and 32-bit numbers with fixed decimal
points; this increases computational productivity. Microprocessors of the

SM 1630 series are compatible with 511-3 and SH-lo couputers with respect to
software. '

At Leipzig system A6402 was shown with the following peripheral units: K8911
operator console with display and keyboard (East Germany); SH 5600 cassette
disk store (Bulgaria); 811 5300 magnetic tape store (Bulgaria); K6200 punched
tape complex (East Germany); cassette external memory with K5261 magnetic tape
(East Germany); VT 27065 parallel printer (Hungary); quasigraphic color display
(East Germany).

It is possible to connect other peripheral units to the system in addition to
those exhibited at the fair: a punched tape input unit; a storage unit on
floppy disks; a series printer; telstypes, and other terminals

System A6602 may work in an autonomous regime or within a hierarchy of computers,
alongside more powerful machines such as the Yes 1055 or Yes 105511. In this
case it is connected to the computer through remote data processing channels.

The mos 1600 operating system was developed for system A6402. Thanks to its
modular structure the operating system permits generation of different operating

system oriented to internal or external memory units. The was 1600 system in-
eludes a control program and the following system programs: Assedler, Linkage
Editor, Editor, Debugging System, Library Program, auxiliary input-output
Programs. programs for access to files, and translators. The operating system
is generated on the basis of recording on disks in the cassette store and it
can work in different regimes: control by several users. multiprogrsming,
control by priority, time-sharing, batch processing, and execution of back-

ground problems for program development parallel with realisation of applied
programs.

The FORTRAN, COBOL, and cm. languages and the interpreter language BASIC are

proposed for use of translators. The system also has software linkage vith Yes
computers.

Problem-oriented software has been developed for the following areas of appli-
cation: date organization, collection of data and compiling of protocols;
standard mathematical functions; mathematical techniques; and, economic processes
(material-technical supply, calculation of labor resources. and the like).

The software was designed on the nodular principle of construction and the
principle of structured program on a uniform technological basis.

System A6601. built on the basis of the [(1620 microprocessor, was exhibited at
the fair for the second time. Its new feature was a linkage with two [8931'
terminals installed nearby. In principle the same peripheral unit can be con-

nected to the junior model A6101 as to the model A6402. In view of interaction
speed it is possible to connect as many as eight terminals.

Quasigraphic Colored Display

Visitors at the fair showed great interest in the quasigraphic colored display.
This device has a tube that is 56 centimeters on the diagonal and a slit mask.
It is designed to display quasigraphic information. The displays are used mainly
at operator positions to monitor continuous processes, for example at power
plants, chemical enterprises, and metallurgical plants. Using this unit the
process can be represented in the form of alphanumeric and simple graphic
images.

The display fornat is 24 by 80 and the set of characters includes 128 fixed
characters and 128 programsble characters. A raster of 5 by 7 points is used
to display alphanumeric characters, vhile a raster of 7 by 9 points is used
for other symbols. Eight different colors are envisioned. both for the fore-
ground and the background.

The quasigraphic colored terminal can be connected to the K1520 and K1620/K1630
microprocessors.

New Articles Based on the K1520 (or SH 1626) Microprocessor

A broad assortment of articles of decentralised coqmter technology has been de-
veloped on the basis of the K1520 microprocessor. Of them the devices reviewed
below uere exhibited at Leipzig for the first time.

The A5220 data collection system is used to collect mass data, for example to
replace punched card unite in all areas of the economy. It is a multiterminal
system that includes a system control unit (controller) and up to eight remote
K8913 data points. The system provides for collection, sorting, preliminary
processing, and transmission of the data collected at the individual terminals.
It can serve as a terminal for other large computers and can be connected to a
computer of any hierarchy. The linkage is accomlished thrOugh a V26 interface.
Data are collected by magnetic tape and floppy disk stores connected to the con-
troller. Information can be outputted to a monitor and printed on a standard
printer.

The controller is a working desk constructed of system K1520 microprocessor
modules and uses the $108 1526 operating system. The simple language of in-
structions makes it possible to formulate various applied programs. The system
contemplates installation of terminals at distances up to 500 meters and con-
necting a series printer to them. In Leipzig programs for data collection in

the field of material-technical supply and for calculation of wages were
demonstrated using the data collection system.

The A5310 electronic writing system. Work with written teXCB takes up a large
part of labor expenditures in all fields of engineering, so the demonstration
of the A5210 electronic writing system, which is designed to streamline this
work, aroused great interest among specialists. The electronic writing system
can be used in all areas of the economy because it can be put together with
different sets of equipment.

The basic variation is the table-model display with a 26 by 80 format. Its
electronic part consists of K1520 microprocessor system modules. The keyboard,
which is similar to a typewriter keyboard, uses international standard keys;
this gives the work a graphic quality and makes control simple.

The base model of this writing system works with floppy disk storage and a disk
printer with solid script characters. This makes it possible to perform the
following functions: preparation and processing of text; copying, correcting,
and cursory control functions; and printing. These functions are the basis for
automatic page printing when outputting and correcting a text or for interaction
between internal and external memory.

Expanded models of system A5310 have the capability of connecting in additional
floppy disk stores. using two storage units on floppy minidisks in the primary
unit, and broadened printing principles. Compared to the base model, they use
almost all types of text processing. Efficient work is achieved in this case
by one file of text modules. addresses. masks, formulas, and assignments.

The 1157 (SH 6309) mosaic printer is a new, high-speed column mosaic printer, the
A1157. It is designed for very diverse fields of application: for example it

can be used with office processors, base computer systems, and as an assembly
built into another unit (OYeH).

The microprocessor-control model 1157 printer prints much faster than the widely
known printers. It is built in four variations which differ by width (132 or 210
characters per line) and speed (150-180 or 320-360 characters per second). The

109
FOR‘OFFNJAI.UBB(NVLY
FOR‘DFFﬂJAl.USE(NULY

printer has a set of 96 characters and can be expanded to 192 characters.
Printing can be done backward and forward. The raster of a character is 9 by 7
points in slow printing and 7by 7 points in fast printing. Up to five copies
can he ends. The following work regines are contemlated: printing on journal
rolls; printing with accordion-type layout; printing on blank bills; and, work
with a nsgnetic card attachnent for calculations.

It is possible to order the its: with Latin and Russian (Cyrillic) script in
normal. cursive. and broad faces.

The A5100 series office processor (three nodels of it were exhibited at the
fair) aroused great interest among visitors despite the fact that similar units
were demonstrated there in 1980. Different variations of the set of equipnent
were displayed: the A5110 (94 1617) office processor designed chiefly for book-
keeping, with the capability of processing text iniornation; the A5120 (8!! 6908)
office processor that is oriented chieily to data collection and processing;
and, the A5130 (8!! 6907) office processor which is the high-productivity unit

of the data group unit and is designed for collecting and processing data. book-
keeping, invoice preparation. and autonoIoue coeputations.

The [(1520 microprocessor is used as the conputing unit in all the models. and
a display, printer, and storage unit on floppy disks or cassette asgxnetic tapes
can be connected to all of then.

The office processors may be connected through remote data processing channels
with central couputing aachines of types “401 or A6602, or the Yes 1055/1055”.

The linkage between an A5130 processor and a Yes 1055)! coQuter was exhibited
at the Leipzig fair.

[mext] Foreword, by A. P. Yershov and I. V. Pcttosin

The works contained in this collection are based on reports given at the fourth
syaposiun on smaject 7 of the problen ”automation of Information Processing and
Application of Mathematics and Couputer Technology to msearch in Boone-ice,

Planning and Control (Information? of Pranco-Soviet Scientific-Technical Coopera-
tion, which was held in October 1978 in Paris. It is one of three directions of

cooperation between the colputer center of the Siberian Depart-ant, USSR Academy
of Sciences and French organizations--theoreticsl programing, translation methods
and the 'nethods of computer consummation in natural language. the reports were
revised somewhat and updated by the authors during preparation of this collection.

Some of the reports presented at the synposiun by Soviet authors have already been
published, and therefore they are not included in this collection, which is why
the size of the French part of the collection is significantly greater.

'lhere is no clear distinction between the two volumes of the collection in terms
of subject matter, though it may be said that the first value is devoted for the
most part to programing methodology, languages and translation methods, while the
second is concerned with theoretical programing and the methods of coquter com-
munication in natural language.

This collection is the second of Franco-Soviet works published by the computer
center of the Siberian Department, WSR Academy of Sciences within the framework
of cooperation in Subject 7. me first collection, Teariya programnirovaniya i
metody translyatsii" [Programming Theory and translation Methods), was published
in 1977.

Foreword

The further development of the USSR Unified Power System (YeES). the largest cen-
trally controlled power company in the world, is foreseen in the "Kain Guidelines
for Economic and Social Development of the USSR for 1981-1985 and for the Period
to 1990," adopted by the 26th CPSU Congress. The entry into service of high-

and ultrahigh—voltage electrotransmission lines and high-power electric power
plants, the intense development of principal and distributing networks, the
connection of new power pools to the USSR YeBS for parallel operation through
relatively poor connections-nan this has emceedingly complicated the problem of
controlling the normal, snd especially the emergency, operating modes of power
systems.

Raving received considerable development in recent years are equipment and systems
for automatically controlling normal modes, making possible the optimum conduct of
a mode taking into account restrictions with regard to the quality of electric power
A centralized automatic frequency and active power control (ARCH!) system has been

created and is operating successfully in the USSR YeBS. Local equipment for
automatic voltage control at substations has become ever more widespread.

Great attention is being paid to the autoaation of distributing networks and sub-
stations. Various kinds of automation equith have made it possible to automate
networks totally, to optimize the normal mode with respect to voltage, and to
restore power automatically to consumers during accidental failures.

A rapidly developing area of automation-womteremergency automation—is of espe-
cially important significance for preventing the development of emergencies in power
systems.

The iwrovement of automation equipment and the heightening of specifications for
their reliability. speed of response and operating selectivity have governed the
need to involve modern hardware in their design, such as semiconductor elements,
remote cutoff devices and analog and digital computer technology elements.

In connection with this the second edition of this book has been revised substan-
tially; it includes descriptions of new automation equipment and systems designed
with modern hardware. The chapter on counteremergency automation has been expanded

considerably and a new chapter has been added, devoted to automatic frequency and
active power control.

The material of this book is presented in such a manner as to give the reader an
idea of the purpose of each kind of automatic equipment. of the basic principles
of its design and of the design structure of individual automation equipment and
systems. Mathematics is brought in to a minimum where this is necessary to explain
the physical fundamentals of the equipment discussed.

This book is intended for specialists involved in designing and servicing automation
equipment for power systems and contains a description of automation circuits and
equipment widely used in our country. The material of this book is discussed

to a fairly complete extent, which makes it possible for it to be used by students
at secondary and higher technical educational institutions. taking the appropriate

courses, who are learning the fields of specialization of automation technician or
electrical engineer.

The authors are grateful to the reviewer, U.I(. Kurbangaliyev. and to the editor,
V.V. Ovchinnikov, for their valuable cements and help in preparing the manuscript.

Introduction

A powerful energy base has been created in the USSR. which has lude possible
speedier development of all sectors of the national economy and the wide introduc-

tion of various electrical appliances for the personal needs of the urban and
rural population.

Eleven united power systems (035's) have been created within whose structure
alaost all of the country's electric power plants are operating already at this
tins. and electric power networks of various voltages-up to 750 kV inclusive
cover a great part of its habitable area. formation of the USSR Unified Power
System—the USSR Yesni-s being completed.

The nature and content of problems relating to ensuring reliability and operating
stability of power systems within the structure of the USSR Yes have changed con-
siderably as it has developed. furthermore such specific aspects of energy pro-
duction as the intereelatedness and interdependence ofmodes and the continuity
and indivisibility of the technological process of generating. transmitting and
distributing electric power have manifested themselves to an ever greater extent,
especially in interruptions of normal operating conditions.

Violation of the normal operating mode of one element of a power system, e.g.,
the cutoff of a power generator or heavily loaded electrotransmission line, can
be reflected in the operation of many other elements of the power system, and
under unfavorable conditions result in breakdown of the entire production process.

In this connection the need has arisen to restore as quickly as possible the normal
operating mode of a failed element or to replace it quickly with another standby
element, as well as to restore the balance of generated and consumed electric power.

Another no less important aspect consists in the fact that electromechanical pro-
cesses in the failure of an electrical circuit or violation of normal conditions
usually originate and take place so quickly that the service personnel of power
plants and substations are in no position to detect the beginning and prevent

the development of these processes in good time. Therefore monitoring and control-
ling the operating conditions of a power system represent highly complicated tech-
nical problems. Fulfillment of these objectives without using special equipment
proves to be impossible in many instances.

The aspects of power production discussed above, as well as others, have made it
necessary to automate power systems to a wide extent.

By the automation of power systems is meant furnishing them with automatic equip-
ment which controls the technological process of the production, transmission and
distribution of electric power under normal and emergency conditions without the

participation of a human being in keeping with a program assigned to this equipment,
and the adjustment of this equipment.

Isolated automation equipment began to be used at individual electric power plants
and substations in the USSR as early as 1935-1936. However the beginning of the
mass introduction of various kinds of automation equipment in power systems must
be set at 1963—19“. Because of the great job done by Soviet scientists and the
personnel of planning organizations and power systems, energy today represents a
highly automated production process.

All automation equipment can be divided into two groups in terms of its purpose and
area of application: technological and system automation equipment.

122
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
In turn, automation equipment in each of these groups is divided into autmtic
control equipment and autonatic regulation equipment.

Technological automation equipment ates possible automatic control or regulation
basically in the normal operating mode. e.g.’, automatic switching on of a syn-
chronous compensator or automatic Ivoltage regulation (ch 3) and automatic syn-
chronization of generators (ch 4). Technological automation equipment is as a
rule of local iwortance.

System automation equipment nakes possible automatic control or regulation
basically under emergency conditions. Therefore under its heading comes equipment
making possible the preventicm or most efficient localisation of failures originat-
ing in a power system, e.g., equipment for automatic regulation and boosting the
excitation of generators (ch 5). for autoutic frequency relief (ch 7) and for
counteremergency automation (ch 8).

APV (ch 1) and AV! (ch 2) equipment usually also comes under the heading of system
automation equipment. However, this equipment in many instances is of local im-
portance.

Automatic regulation of frequency and active power overcurrent (ch 6) comes under
the heading of system automation of normal conditions.
