[Text] ANNOTATION

The authors present materials concerning the investigation of the characteristics of
rotor vibration gyroscopes and methods for balancing them, in addition to formulat—
ing requirements for information extraction and processing devices. They also pre-
sent techniques for synthesizing a regulator for stabilization and correction cir-
cuits for the purpose of obtaining the required characteristics.

POMURD

In recent years, rotor vibration gyroscopes (RVG) have been used more and more fre-
quently in navigation systems. Since they are small in size and low in weight, they
make it possible to miniaturize the sensitive elements of navigation systems and ob—
tain characteristics with a level of accuracy that is no worse than that of gyro-
scopic devices constructed according to the classical method.

In order to obtain the best characteristics of such systems, it is important to de-
scribe correctly not only the static, but also the dynamic characteristics of RVG's
as components of an automatic control system. In turn, when planning RVG's it is

necessary to take the special features of their operation into consideration in the

composition of the specific control system. All of this requires a detailed inves-
tigation of the theory of RVG's and gyroscopic systems in which they are used.

This book consists of five chapters. In the first two we discuss the generalized
model on which most existing RVG systems are based. The analysis of the equations
of motion is carried out with the utilisation of well—developed operator methods.
The special features of RVG's as two-dimensional measuring units make it possible to
use a special apparatus that was developed for two-dimensional automatic control
systems [16,17]. Such an approach to the analysis of the operation of va's makes
it possible to perform operations (’i:ectly with their transfer functions. For the
simplest RVG systems, the transfer functions-~as approximated in the area of the es-
sential frequencies-~are described by simple analytical expressions. For complex

systems, the analogous frequency characteristics can be constructed quite easily
with the help of a computer. A knowledge of the frequency characteristics makes it
possible to select the instrument's basic parameters in such a manner as to provide
it with the required dynamic characteristics. This is especially important for
RVG's operating in automatic regulation and control systems. For the analysis of
RVG's having rotors with different angular velocities, we propose to use the spec-
tral methods of (Khil's) generalized theory of equations [10,16,27,34].

In the second chapter we discuss the most cmnnon errors in va's with a single drive
motor. The basic attention is devoted to errors related to angular vibrations of

the motor's shaft at a frequency equal to twice its frequency of rotation and to
static disbalance of the rotors.

In the third chapter we present one of the most promising (from the authors' view-
point) layouts for composite RVG's. In an example of this layout we investigate the
basic errors in this type of instrument, as well as methods of reducing them.

The fourth and fifth chapters are devoted to an investigation of the special fea-
tures of the operation of gyroscopically stabilized platforms (GSP) based on RVG's.
The investigation is based on the frequency methods of analyzing and synthesizing
automatic control systems that are widely used in engineering calculations. Here
there is a detailed discussion of the technique for selecting the stabilization
channels' basic parameters. There is an analysis of the effect of the non-steady-
state component of an va's output signal on the operation of a 65?. Multi-
dimensional stabilization systems are discussed from the viewpoint of the effect on
their operation of the specific cross-couplings between the stabilization channels.

This book lays no claims to being a complete explication of the theory of RVG's and
systems that utilize them. In it we do not discuss questions of the optimum synthe-
sis of systems with RVG's, the effect of basic nonlinearities on the operation of
such systems, the theory of systems using composite RVG's that are self-orienting in
the plane of the horizon and the meridian, and others. The investigation of these
questions is necessary for the creation of RVG-based gyroscopic systems operating
effectively in various navigation complexes.

The book is intended for engineers and scientific workers specializing in the field
of the development and use of new gyroscopic instruments.

The authors are deeply grateful to Professor Ye.L. Smirnov, doctor of technical sci-
ences, for his valuable advice and the comments he made during the preparation of
the manuscript for publication.

Z$TRODUCTION

modern navigation systems are constructed on the basis of the most recent achieve-
ments of computer technology and, for all practical purposes. carry out completely
those operations that were previously performed by man.

Sespite the presence of modern information processing facilities, the accuracy of
navigation systems is determined primarily by the accuracy of the instruments that

they utilize as sources of primary information. A special group among these instru-
ments is composed of gyroscopic instruments and systems. They are used as the basis

for the construction of inertial navigation (Isa) and orientation (ISO) systems that
insure the independent determination of an object's location and its spatial orien-
tation, regardless of the presence of external reference points.

In order to create an 18“, it is necessary to have on board information about the
object's orientation relative to a reference system of coordinates and the instanta-
neous absolute velocities or accelerations disolacing its center of mass. When de-
signing platformless inertial systems (BIS), the sources of such information are
gyroscopic sensors of absolute angular velocities and accelerometers or gyroscopic
linear acceleration integrators (GILU). In other ISN design variants, the reference
system of coordinates is created directly on board the object with the help of

GSP's. In this case the accelerometers or GILU's are installed either on the CS? or
in the object itself.

Most of the gyroscopic instruments now in use are designed according to the classic
method of a precession gyroscope in a cardan suspension. The basic element of these
instruments is a massive, rapidly spinning rotor, in which an additional one or two
degrees of freedom is provided because of the suspension’s framework. An improve-
ment in the accuracy of such gyroscopes is achieved by increasing the rotor's kinet-
ic moment and reducing the disturbing moments. Judging by voluminous data that are
available. the possibilities for improving gyroscopes built according to the classic
method have been exhausted to a considerable degree, and further progress in this
direction would require significant expenditures.

The high degree of saturation of modern transportation facilities with on-board
instrument-type equipment makes a matter of concern the question of the miniaturiza-
tion of separate elements of this equipment, with particular emphasis on electro-
mechanical devices, among which are included gyroscopic instruments and systems. At
the same time, a reduction in the size and weight of gyroscopic instruments designed
according to the classical method entails considerable design and technological dif-
ficulties, as well as a reduction in the kinetic moment, which leads to a lowering
of their accuracy. All of this has forced the developers of ISO's and ISN's to look
for new ways to create gyroscopic instruments that, along with high accuracy, would
be small in size and cost comparatively little.

At the present time we have seen several fundamentally new trends in the creation of
gyroscopic instruments capable of competing successfully with gyroscopes constructed
according to the classic method [19). One of the most highly developed directions

is the construction of rotor vibration gyroscopes. The term "vibration gyroscope"

(VG) is understood to mean a device containing special elements that, given absolute
angular velocities of the gyroscope's base, perform induced oscillations. It can be
said that any vibration gyroscope can modulate a constant input angular velocity by
transforming it into an amplitude-modulated gyroscopic moment. If the frequency of
the change in the gyroscopic moment coincides with the natural frequency of the me-
chanical system transforming this moment into angular deflections of the sensitive

elements, resonance occurs in the instrument that makes it possible to increase its
transmission factor by several orders of magnitude. In connection with this the

value of the kinetic moment still does not play an eseential role, which means that
high sensitivity can be achieved along with miniaturization of the instrument.

The suspension of a VG's sensitive elements is usually made of elastic elements,

which eliminates such an important source of errors as the ”dry" friction that

occurs in the ball-bearing supports of gyroscopes constructed according to the clas-
sic method. The presence of an amplitude-modulated output signal makes it possible,
with the help of well-developed radio engineering methods, to avoid the effects of a

number of sources of random interference in the information extraction and process-
ing system.

The first serious attempts to create vibration gyroscopes resulted in the realiza-
tion of designs of so-called oscillator vC's, among which the tuning-fork gyrosopce
[3,4] is included. Oscillator VG's lack rotating masses, and in order to create
Coriolis acceleration in the presence of absolute angular velocities of the base,
forced vibrations of special elastic elements (tuning fork blade, strings, rods and
so forth) are used. The Coriolis forces' amplitude-modulated moment acts on an
elastic suspension that is tuned to resonance on a carrier frequency in order to in-
crease the instrument's transmission factor.

Oscillator VG's have a whole series of advantages: small size and low energy con-
sumption, high reliability with a fundamentally achievable high sensitivity to abso-
lute angular velocities of the base, and so on. However, the transmission factor of
oscillator VG's is very sensitive to even insignificant changes in the instrument's
parameters. The high sensitivity of oscillator VG's is achieved by tuning the elas-
tic system's natural oscillations into resonance, with the minimum possible damping
factor. Keeping this performance stable requires that the frequency of the elastic
system's natural oscillations and the frequency of the forced vibrations be kept
constant during operation, which is hardly achievable at the present time without
the use of complicated and cumbersome special equipment. The result of the effect
of these facts is that instruments built according to the plan of oscillator VG's
are in extremely limited practical use.

Dynamically tuned RVG's are, to a considerable degree, free of the basic flaw inher-
ent in oscillator VG's. In them, the amplitude-modulated gyroscopic moment is cre-
ated hecause of one or several rotating bodies. In connection with this, the posi-
tional moments, which try to bring the system into a position of equilibrium, are
determined not only by static rigidity, but also by dynamic rigidity (or the so-
called centrifugal-pendulum rigidity). An RVG's parameters are usually selected so
that in the resonance operating mode, the static rigidity is much less than the dy-
namic. In connection with this, a change in the elastic system's characteristics
changes only the static rigidity and has an insignificant effect on the system's to-
tal rigidity. however, a change in the drive motor's frequency of rotation, which
causes a change in the frequency of the gyroscopic moment acting on the elastic sys-
tem, results in a corresponding change in the dynamic rigidity, which means a change
in the elastic system's total rigidity. Detuning from resoance obviously has a con-
siderably smaller effect in this case than under analogous conditions for oscillator
VC‘s, the rigidity of the elastic suspension of which does not depend on the fre-

quency of the inducing force. Therefore, the most recent developments and successes
in the field of the creation of VG's are basically related to the realization of
various plans for dynamically tuned avc's [15].

The theoretical principles of the operation of RVG's have been created primarily
through the efforts of Soviet and American scientists. Among the numerous investi-
gations. the basic ones are the works of Ye.L. Smirnov and L.I. Brozgul' [3,4] and
A.I. Sukov, (Dzh. N'yuton), E. Rowe, R. Craig and P. Savet [20,33,42,46]. These
works (with the exception of [42]) are devoted to the theory of single- and

double-rotor avc's, which are the easiest to realize. However. the systems dis-

cussed in them do not give a complete picture of the potential capabilities of
va's.

The existence of basic RVG defects, which are related to angular vibrations in the
supports of the drive motor’s shaft at a frequency twice that of the frequency of
rotation. as well as static disbalance of the rotors under conditions of linear ac-
celeration of the base, forces us to look for ways of reducing these defects.
Tightening of the tolerances in the production process for the separate elements

and assemblies of an instrument leads to the same problems encountered by the devel-
opers of gyroscopes built according to the traditional method. Therefore, some in-
vestigators are looking into the possibility of improving RVG accuracy by creating
multirotor VG's [42] and VG's having different angular velocities of the rotors.

A great deal of interest is being shown in systems of composite RVG’s. which make it
possible to combine a two-component measure: of absolute angular velocities and lin-
ear accelerations of the base in a single instrument (43.48]. The theory of multi-
rotor vG's. allowing for the possibility of imparting different angular velocities
to the rotors, as well as composite RVG's, is not yet sufficiently developed.

Previously, the development and use of RVG's was held back by technological problems
that were difficult to solve. The present state of the technology is such that we
can speak as boldly about RVG's as about today's gyroscopes. Their widespread use
will make it possible to create a new generation of gyroscopic instruments and sys-
tems distinguished by high accuracy, small size and relatively low cost.

In accordance with the data in the intro-
duction, in the general case we will under-
stand an RVG to be a system consisting of n
material bodies that are connected to each
other sequentially and have different mo-
ments of inertia relative to their main ax-
es, which are rotating around a common axis
at different rates of speed. Relative to
each other, these bodies must have degrees
of freedom of angular displacement around
axes lying in a plane that is perpendicular
to the axis of rotation. The system must
also contain units that measure the bodies'
angular rotations relative to each other or
to the housing. A functional diagram of
such a generalized RVG model is depicted in
Figure 1, while the system of coordinates
is shown in Figure 2.

Let us derive the equations of motion of
the generalized RVG model, and introduce
the concept of a stage of the generalized
model. we will understand a stage of the
generalized model to mean the drive motor's
rotor P01: which has axial moment of iner-
tia J(1) and equatorial moment of inertia

ments and their parameters belong to the i-th stage. Thus, the proposed generalized .

RVG model can be regarded as a set of elementary stages in which the stator (PD) of
the preceding stage is coupled rigidly with the NR of the following one. We will

stipulate that the numbering of the stages begins with the stage that is farthest
from the base.

In formulating the equations of motion, let us introduce the following basic assump-
tion: we will assume the angles of rotation of N81 and VRi relative to the base to
be quite small. This, naturally,,means that the relative angles 01 and °i are also
required to be small. Considering the diversity of methods for taking readings from
an RVG, wel will formulate the generalized model's equations of motion in the iner-
tial system of coordinates oixvz. In order to do this in accordance with Figure 2,
we will introduce angles a1, 3i! Yi of rotation of NR; in the inertial system of
reference, having related system of coordinates 0(1)XH1)Yé1’2é1) to NR; and system

o‘i’xéi)réi)zéi) to VR1. In order to determine the characteristic features of mo-

tion of motion of the va elements and obtain visible results, we will limit our-

selves to a discussion of linearized equations of motion only and take into consid-
eration only terms of the first order of smallness when the PD is in a steady-state

operating mode.

The equations of motion of the generalized model's first stage were derived in [8].
Using these equations, and allowing for the presence of the gyroscopic moments gen-
erated by rotor PD in the subsequent stages' equations of motion, we write the equa-
tions of motion of the generalized RVC model in the following form:

for the disturbing moments, the elastic moments in the suspension axes and the reac-
tion moments superimposed from the (n - 1) -th stage onto the n-th stage. In the

Thus, when expressions (1.2) and (1.3) are taken into consideration, equations (1.1)
are a linearized, generalized mathematical model of the RVG represented by the func-
tional diagram in Figure 1.

Equations (1.1) contain the absolute coordinates of rotation of the rotors in iner-
tial space and the relative coordinates of their rotation in the suspension axes.

Let us eliminate the relative coordinates from the equations of motion. In order to
do this. we will determine the solution of the three kinematic equations for each
Stage. The first equation has the obvious solution

"’u 'ﬂJ‘YII‘u—‘Iu -!‘ 'l'". (1.4)

In the first approximation the absolute angular velocity *n for each stage is, obvi-
ously, expressed easily from the kinematic equations in terms of the PD's relative
angular velocities with the help of the following equality:

[II
where uo - angular velocity of the PD mounted on the nonrotating base.

Equations (1.9) are quite convenient for investigating the motion of the RVG's ele-
ments in inertial space. however, they do not reflect all of the characteristics of
the RVG as a measuring instrument. since readings are usually made in the system of
coordinates that is linked with the base. Therefore, it is necessary to have the
possibility of writing the equations of motion in a measuring system of coordinates.
Depending on the type and structural features of the RVG, the measurement can be
made in a system of coordinates that is rotating and immobile relative to the base.
In connection with this. it is possible to measure the angles of rotation of the in-
scrument's elements relative to the base and to each other. In the case of measure-
ment of the angles of rotation relative to the base. with due consideration for the
assumptions we have made, the transition to the measuring system of coordinates can
be made with the help of the expression

X: -. i:.-"~' s — i. -1. 1.7. .u, (1.11)
where :2 - vector of the angle of rotation_8f the n-th stage's NR relative to the

base in the nonrotating measuring system; kn - the same, in the system rotating
along with the rotor.

When measuring the relative angles of rotation of the rotors of the Z-th and k-th
stages, it is possible to use a system of coordinates that is immobile relative to
the base, as well as one that is rotating together with the rotor of either the i-th
or k-th stage. In the first case. in order to convert to the measuring system of
coordinates it is possible to use the relationship

In the second and third cases the conversion formulas take on the following forms,
respeccively:

’77- .3 (—i, + i.)e""’. (1.14)

within the framework of the assumptions we have made. the derived equations of mo-
:ion of the generalized RVG model describe the operation of all types of gyroscopes
with kinematics corresponding to the system depicted in Figure 1. From then. we de-
rive the equations of motion of practically all mechanical gyroscopes constructed
according to the classic method as a special case.

1.2. Classification of Layouts of Rotor Vibration Gyroscopes

In any branch of science and technology, the problem of classification and develop-
ment of a unified terminology is one of the most important ones. Its solution makes
it possible to review completed investigations, generalize their results, and plan
the path of further development work.

The term "rotor vibration gyroscopes“ limits substantially the class of gyroscopic
instruments under discussion by indicating their structural features and the fea-
tures of their component elements' motion. At the present time. however. a general-
ly accepted classification of va's themselves does not exist, for all practical
purposes. An attempt to create one was made in [4]. There, the basis used for the
classification of RVG's was the nature of the rotor's motion in a nonrotating system
of coordinates. In that work, however, the authors do not allow for several struc-
tural features of possible RVG layouts, such as the number of rotors and drive mo—
tors, as well as methods for reading the signal from an RVG's rotor. Using the mod-
el described in Section 1.1, we will attempt to create a classification that will
reflect, as completely as possible, all the characteristic features of instruments
constructed according to RVG principles.

The broadest concept in this classification should obviously be that of "rotor gyro-
scopes" (36), which we will take to mean any mechanical gyroscopes containing a ro-
tating rotor. Rc's can be divided into two large groups: rotor vibration gyro-
scopes and precession rotor gyroscopes (PR6), which include practically all the pos-
sible types of gyroscope: constructed according to the traditional plan for a gyro-
scope in a cardan suspension. The gradation of RVG's should be done on different
levels, each of which defines the characteristic features of the plan of the instru-
ment's structure.

On the first level we will differentiate RVG's according to the number of PD's or—-
using radio engineering terminology--modulation frequency ”generators” they have.
When an RVG has a single PD, the useful signal can have a modulation frequency that
equals the PD‘s angular velocity or a multiple of it. We will call these va's
modulation rotor gyroscopes (MEG), understanding the word ”modulation" to mean the
presence of only a single modulation of the useful signal. RVG's having two or more
FD's will be called heterodyne rotor gyroscopes (636). The presence of several PD's
results in a situation where a GRG's useful signal follows not only on the PD's ro-
tation frequencies and multiples of them, but also on composite frequencies. Since
in this case there is a direct analogy with the basic elements of heterodyne instru-
ments, the use of the corresponding terminology is logical.

O: the second level we will divide avc's according to the number of separate, rotat-
ing rotor bodies, excluding the rOtor of the PD, which is mounted directly on the
base. Correspondingly, let us introduce the following terms: single-rotor modula-
tion gyroscope (0M6), two-rotor modulation gyroscopes (DMG) and so on and, analo-
gously, two-rotor heterodyne gyroscope (DGG). three-rotor heterodyne gyroscope (T05)
and so on. The concept of a single-rotor heterodyne gyroscope obviously does not
make physical sense. Given an equal number of rotors, multirotor GRG's can be dif-
ferentiated Structurslly by the number of rotors in each of the stages that is coup-
led with a specific PC.

Following (4]. on the third level we classify RVG's according to the position of
their suspension axes relative to the base. Here there are three possible cases.

In the first case, the suspension axes rotate relative to the base jointly with the
90‘s shaft. Such RVG‘s we will call RVG's with rotating suspension (VP), assuming
that each rotor has three degrees of freedom. In the second case, the suspension
axes remain immobile relative to the base. This is an RVG with nonrotating suspen-
sion (NP). Finally, it is possible to have a situation where part of the suspension
axes remain immobile and part of them rotate relative to the base along with the

13
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
H)“ (ll-I'll IAL USE ONLY

PD's shaft. Such suspension we will call composite, and the instruments belong to
the group of RVG's with composite suspension (KP). In the general case, an NP can
have three degrees of freedom, while a KP GRG can have a different number of degrees
of freedom for each of the stages.

0n the fourth (and last) level, we will classify RVG's according to the systems for
taking readings that are used in them. As has already been said, for multirotor
RVG's readings can be taken by several methods: in different coordinate systems,

between different bodies and so forth. We will use a frequency feature, which makes
it possible to generalize signal reading methods to some degree. It follows direct-
ly from the equations of motion that it is possible to read a useful signal on a ze-
ro carrier frequency (permanent deviation of the rotor in the measuring system of
coordinates), on the PD's frequencies of rotation and multiples of them for "35's,
and on composite frequencies for GRG's. It is also possible to have composite sig-
nal reading when readings are taken for a single instrument by several methods at
the same time. Thus, when determining the affiliation of an RVG with a certain
group, we should give the characteristics of its system for taking readings with re-
spect to the frequency on which further discrimination of the useful signal takes
place.

Figure 3 is a diagram that illustrates the proposed classification. It should be
mentioned here that all types of va's coming under this classification are de-
scribed by equations of motion (1.9). and that their layouts can be derived from the
layout of the generalized RVG model presented in Figure I.

As an example. let us examine several types of MRG's. widely known layouts of OHG's
with VP are obtained from an examination on only the first stage of the generalized
model. which corresponds to the layout of a one with orthogonal positioning of the
rotors' suspension axes. If, in connection with this, the VR's moments of inertia
equal zero, we obtain the plan of an one. the suspension of which to the shaft of
the PD has two degrees of freedom. In order to obtain an OMS with one degree of
freedom of the rotor's suspension from the shaft, in the preceding plan it is neces—
sary to change the rigidity along one of the suspension axes to infinity. Two
stages of the generalized model make it possible to obtain the plan of a four-rotor
modulated gyroscope (ChMG) with VP and with KP, in which the suspension of each ro-
tor has only one degree of freedom. In the first case, the frequency of rotation of
P01 should be set equal to zero (‘1 - O). In connection with this, any angle be-
tween the axes of the suspension of the second and third (reading from the PD's
shaft) rotors can be given. In the second case it is necessary to set the frequency
of rotation of P02 equal to zero (mo - 0). Layouts of who's with VP and with KP are
derived from the corresponding ChMG plans. In connection with this, depending on
which rotor is eliminated from the discussion, the suspension of the next (reading
from the base) rotor will have two degrees of freedom with respect to the preceding
one. Assuming that the rigidity along one of this rotor's suspension axes equals
infinity, we obtain a TMG with one-stage suspension of the rotors. Finally, by
eliminating yet another rotor from the discussion, we can obtain a DMG in which the
suspension of each rotor has two degrees of freedom. The special features of the
operation of some of these systems will be investigated in the following sections.

1.3. Equations of Motion of Rotor vibration Gyroscopes

From the discussion of the generalized RVG model it follows that it can be used as a
basis for constructing various (multistage) RVG layouts. At the present time, how-
ever, multistage RVG's are of theoretical interest only, since their realization en-
tails the solution of an entire complex of problems. Therefore, from now on we will
limit ourselves to the investigation of only those of them that are obtained on the
basis of two stages of the generalized model.

As derived from equations (1.9) with due consideration for equality (1.10), the
equations of motion of the two stages take on the following form:

Let us first turn to the equations of motion of layouts with single modulation of
the signal. There are two varieties of such layouts, namely when the modulation is
provided by the second stage's drive motor PD2 and when it is provided by the first
stage's drive motor PDl. Let us examine these two cases in sequence.

In the first case. in equations (1.15) it is necessary to set 51 = 0. 1(2) - 1:2) -
- 0. In connection with this, the first and second stages' suspension axes are ar-
bitrarily oriented relative to each other in the plane of rotation. In order to al-
low for this orientation, we will introduce angle 612. which characterizes the rota-
tion of the first stage's suspension axis relative to the second, from an initial
position where the suspension axes of the corresponding rotors in each stage coin-
cide, in the direction of rotation at velocity mo. In equations (1.15). it is then
necessary to set, additionally, 01: - 012. Thus, the equations of motion of a four-
rotor VG with single modulation realized by the rotation of 902 have the form:

(1.16)

Three-. two- and single-rotor mac's are special cases of this layout. In order to
obtain the equations of motion for a three-rotor M36 in which each subsequent rotor
has only one degree of freedom relative to the preceding one, it is sufficient to
set I§§’ - Iég) - Iég’ - 0 and CéZ) * 0 in equations (1.16). If the suspension of

the third (counting from the instrument's base) rotor has two degrees of freedom in
the plane of rotation relative to the second rotor, in equations (1.16) we should
set Iéé’ - 16%) - Iég) - 0. If the second rotor has two degrees of freedom relative

to the first. we should set Iég’ - 1:3) - Iég) - 0. and it the first rotor has two

degrees of freedom relative to the PD's shaft, we should set Iég) - Iég’ - Iég) - 0.

A two-rotor HRS with one degree of freedom of the suspension of each rotor is well

known [3) and is a setup that has already been realized in practice. Its equation

corresponds to the first equation in (1.16), for £2 - U and 912 - 0:

If the fifst stage has a single rotor, in equations (1.18 it is necessary to set

we will obtain the equations of motion of an 0M6 with NP, or a so-called precession-
vibration astatic gyroscope (PVAG) [16], allowing for the finite rigidity of the

shaft of the gyroscope' s rotor. The equations of motion of a gyrotachometer with a
rotor having unequal equatorial moments of inertia also follow from (equations: (1. 18)

It is interesting to note that equations (1.18) also describe the motion of a bi-
axial gyrostabilized platform when i s suspension axes are in a position that is

close to orthogonal and the sensitive elements are two- or one-rotor (I§%’ = 141) =

IZB =0) RVG' s with single modulation. In connection with this, the relationship

The equations of motion of an RVG with single modulation realized by P02 are non-
stationary and have periodically changing coefficients. The nonstationary nature of
the equations for this type of gyroscope is caused by the choice of the inertial
reading system when describing their motion, and can be eliminated with the help of
the method proposed in [16). Actually, let us examine equations (1. 16). They con-
tain four unknowns: x1, X2. x1e” 2uot’ xze-Zwot. To each of these equations we will
apply operator 9 -i2uot' and then the operation of complex conjugation to the left
and right sides of the ensuing equations. As a result, we obtain two equations:

With the help of this method, the equations of motion of an RVG with single modula-

tion realized by FBI can be reduced to a stationary form only if the following con-
dition is fulfilled:

From (1.15) it follows that condition (1.22) takes place only when the following re-
lationships between the Mac‘s parameters are fulfilled:
nan-.0; mat): 122=F—.(Js-':—J:1-2-H;-2)=o.

The first two of these require that the second stage's suspension be uniformly rigid
and have identical damping coefficients along both axes. The third condition can be

fulfilled either if there is an inverted cardan suspension or if the suspension has
an inner framework with Jég) = 0.

Thus, when condition (1.22) is fulfilled, the equations of motion of an RVG with

where the expressions for operators "k9. (p) coincide with the analogous expressions

presented in equations (1.20) when the equalities uo - 61 and 012 - o are substitut-

(1.23)

RVG systems with double modulation can be differentiated by the number of rotors in
the first and second stages. In addition to a four-rotor setup, it is possible to
have setups with one first-stage rotor, one second-stage rotor and one first- and

second-stage rotor. The operation of all these systems is described by equations
(1.15) when the appropriate values of the instrument's parameters are substituted
into them.

Equations (1.15) are nonstationary, with harmonically changing coefficients. In
connection with this, there are two coefficient-changing frequencies: frequency
2mg, which is the 902's doubled frequency of rotation, and frequency 2(61 + mo),
which is the doubled total frequency of rotation of 901 and P02. The periodic co-
efficients that change with frequency Zoo can obviously be eliminated by selecting
the appropriate system of coordinates for writing the equations of motion. Making
use of this fact, let us transform equations (1.15) so that in them we have periodic
coefficients that change with only one frequency. With this purpose in mind, by us-
ing the previously applied method we first eliminate the periodic coefficients in
front of the unknown x1 in the first equation (1.15). As a result, we obtain

Thus, in order to solve system (1.15) it is necessary to solve equation (1.27) with
harmonic coefficients that change with frequency 201 and then substitute the solu-

tion that has been found with respect to x2 into equation (1.24) and integrate the
derived stationary equation with respect to XI.

1.4. signal Reading and Information Processing Systems

One of the most important components of an RVG, and one that has much to do with de-
termining its accuracy and sensitivity, is the system for reading the angle of

28
FOR OFHGAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

rotation of the RVG's rotors relative to the base or each other and then processing
the obtained information. Depending on the reading method that is used, the useful
information about the angular velocities of the base's rotation relative to the in-
strument's axes of sensitivity consists either of constant angular deflections of
the rotors in a system of coordinates that is coupled with the base or of amplitude-
modulated oscillations of the rotors at frequencies that are equal to or multiples
of the 90's frequencies of rotation or are composite frequencies. For any signal
reading method. however. the range of working angles for the unit that measures a
rotor's angle of rotation should range from approximately 0.01 to tens of angular
seconds. The measurement of such small angular movements is a quite complicated
technical problem. In principle it can be solved with the help of angle measurers
of different types [38]. In connection with this, the general requirements for them
are:

1) high static accuracy; that is, the absence at the angle measurer's output of a
zero signal that is synchronous with the useful signal and exceeds a given level;

2) high dynamic accuracy, which means that signal formation must take place with
inimum distortions within the limits of the instrument's band of operating frequen-
cies;

3) high sensitivity and a low sensitivity threshold;

4) minimum reactive effect on the RVG's rotors:

S) sufficiently high output signal power;

6) high reliability and resistance to interference when operating under conditions
determined by the tactical and technical requirements.

Angle measurers can be divided, according to their operating principle. into:

1) passive measurers, requiring an external power source;

2) active measurers, which generate a signal proportional to the value being meas-
ured.

Passive measurers include those of the capacitive and inductive types, while active
ones include those of the induction and piezoelectric types. In order to eliminate
the effect of linear oscillations of the rotors on the instrument's operation and
provide the uaximum possible sensitivity, all of these measurers are built with dif-
ferential circuitry.

Let us examine several features of passive angle measurers. Their operating princi-
ple is based on the measurement of the change in the reactance of the gap between a
sensitive element and the sensor's elements. In the case of a capacitive measurer.
the sensitive element is one of the capacitor‘s plates. A second capacitor plate is
mounted on the housing or rotating part of the instrument. When the rotor is de-
flected the size of the gap in the capacitor changes and, consequently. there is a
change in its capacitance. For an inductive measurer. the rotor acts as an armature
that completes the magnetic current of the sensitive coil.

A comparative analysis of capacitive and inductive measurers showed that. all other
conditions being equal, the sharpness of a capacitive measurer's signal is 50-100
times higher than that of an inductive measurer. Some comparative characteristics
of these sensors are given in Table 1. From the table it follows that with respect

to all the basic parameters, a capacitive sensor is considerably better than an in-
ductive one.

Figure 4 is a diagram of a capacitive measurer. Rotor P is located between four

plates 0, which--depending on the choice of the measuring system of coordinates--are

with the 90's shaft. or are mounted on
another of the RVG's rotors. The rotor,
together with the plates, forms four capa-
citance: C1, C2, C3 and C4. When the rotor
turns through angle a, capacitances C1 and
23 will be reduced. while C2 and c4 will
increase, and vice versa. Capacitances C1,
C2, C3 and C4 are connected in parallel, in
Figure 4. Diagram of capacitive angle pairs, and can be connected to the arms of
sensor. a bridge (Figure 5). If plates C1-C4 are
mounted on the rotating part of an instru-
ment. an inductive or capacitive commutator is used to transmit the signal to the
base. The former consists of a transformer, one of the windings L1, L; (which is
mounted on the PD's shaft) and another winding L3 that is on the instrument's hous-
ing (Figure Sb). A capacitive commutator consists of two pairs of concentric rings,

cessary that C5 >> C1 + C3 and C6 >> C2 + c4. Variable power voltage is fed
into one of the bridge's diagonals. In accordance with the recommendations for this
type of measurer, the power frequency is chosen in the 0.1-1 MHz band. Signal volt-
age “sig is read from the bridge's other diagonal. The signal voltage can be calcu-
lated with the formula

equilibrium position: Co = initial capacitance of the capacitors.

From formula (1.28) it follows that the dependence of “sig on angle a is, in the
general case, of a nonlinear nature. Therefore, it is extremely important to take
into consideration the required range of measured frequencies and the allowable non-
linearity of the instrument's static characteristic when selecting the initial value
of the gap between the sensitive element and the capacitors' plates.

In order to create an instrument with a linear static characteristic, it is possible
to use a transformer-type bridge connection circuit. Such a circuit corresponds to
the one depicted in figure Sb if “now is fed into winding L3 and the signal is read

however. such a circuit has a high noise level and a high sensitivity threshold.

X! It is feasible to use a piezoelectric sen-
sor [8] only when the amplitude of the
RVG's sensitive elements' oscillations that
is being measured is of a sufficiently high
frequency. The connection diagram of such
a sensor is shown in Figure 6. It provides
for the measurement of angular vibrations,
with self-compensation for linear vibra-
tions, with accuracy up to that of the

The signal voltage's dependence on angular acceleration a is linear. consequently,
the dependence of “sig on the base's angular veloity will also be linear.

The shortcomings of a piezoelectric sensor include the effect of the processing cir-
cuit's capacitance and the cable's capacitance on the output signal's value, as well
as the necessity of deriving the signal from the rotating part of the RVG.

When the useful signal is read in the form of amplitude-modulated oscillations, the
processing system solves the problem of obtaining two direct-current signals that
are proportional to the angular velocities of the base's notion relative to the in-
strument's axes of sensitivity. Figure 7 is a functional diagram of such a system.
The signal arriving from the bridge of the measurer of angular rotor displacements
(IU) consists of oscillations with the frequency of the change in the power voltage
and balance-modulated oscillations with the useful signal's frequency. The ampli-
rude and phase of the latter contain the information about the base's angular velo-
cities.

The first stage of the signal's processing is its demodulation on frequency fpow.

In order for this to take place, the signal “sig from the bridge enters demodulator
3, into which a signal from generator G (which generates the bridge's power voltage)
is sent as a reference signal. Oscillations with an amplitude proportional to the

av rotcr's angle of rotation are obtained at 0'3 output. This part of the circuit
is absent in aetive measurers.

After preliminary amplification by anplifier U, the signal up from 0': output is
sent into phase-sensitive demodulator FD. The reference signal for PD is generated

with the help of reference pulse generators 601. A 601 consists of a magnet that is
pressufitted into the rotating part of the instrument and a coil mounted on the
housing. When the magnet passes by the coil, an EDS [electromotive force] in the
form of a short pulse is induced in it. The magnets in the rotating part are situ-
ated at an angle of 180° to each other, while the two coils in the housing are at an
angle of 90° to each other. When reading on intermediate frequencies, the magnets
and coils can be situated on the appropriate rotating parts. After amplification
with the help of amplifiers 01 and U2, the pulses from the 601‘s enter reference
Signal processing circuit SVO. When necessary, this circuit can contain a frequency
conversion circuit. 0n receiving signals from GOIl and GOI2, triggers T1 and T2, '
which are operating in a waiting mode, generate rectangular reference voltage pulses
that are shifted 90' relative to each other.

The phase-sensitive demodulator is a comparison circuit (551 and $52). The refer-
ence vultages from the triggers and the amplified signal from the demodulator enter
it and constant voltages ul and uz, which are proportional to the base's angular ve-
locities, are obtained at its output.

The extremely simple circuits for reading and processing information from an RVG are
not the only ones possible. Inductive angle sensors can be used successfully in in-
struments of this type. In order to increase their sensitivity, capacitive or in-
ductive sensors can be built into the driving crystal oscillator's resonant circuit.
Preliminary processing of the useful signal, by placing electronic units directly on
the rotating part of an instrument, is used quite frequently. Conversion from amp-
litude modulation to frequency modulation or to amplitude modulation on some inter-
mediate frequency is another practice that is used.

This brief analysis of RVG information reading and processing systems shows that, in
contrast to gyroscopes constructed according to the traditional plan, RVG's are a
symbiosis of mechanical and electrical parts, with the latter having a substantial
effect on the design and basic characteristics of these instruments. This fact com-
pels us to develop a new approach to the process of designing such gyroscopes that
involves a more nearly complete consideration of the demands made on the mechanical
part by the information reading and processing system.

1.5. Methods for Solving Differential Equations with Periodic Coefficients

As was shown in Section 1.3, in the general case RVG's are described by linear dif-
ferential equations with harmonically changing coefficients. In connection with
this--and regardless of the information reading and processing method--a character-
istic of all RVG‘s is the presence in the output signal of a harmonic component that
changes with the doubled frequency of rotation of the instrument's rotor, while for
RVG‘s with multiple modulation it also changes with multiples of this frequency and
composite frequencies. Therefore, when there is inadequate filtration of the output
signal and a broad transmission band, systems containing RVG's will (in the general
:ese) by described by differential equations with periodically changing coeffi-
:ients.

According to Lyapunov's fundamental theorem [ll], any differential equation with
periodic coefficients can be reduced to an equivalent linear differential equation

with constant coefficients. at the present time, however, no universal algorithm
for this reduction has yet been found. Therefore, the analysis of the properties of

33

solutions of equations with periodic coefficient usually involves considerable dif-
ficulties.

The development in recent years of electronic computer technology makes it possible
to use the methods of numerical integration of differential equations to analyze
equations of motion. When these methods are used, however, the presence in an RVG's
output signal of a slowly changing component and a harmonic component having a rath-
er high frequency should be taken into consideration. The requirement that both
components be allowed for means that the amount of machine time needed to integrate
the equations of motions is increased sharply. At the same time, the necessity of
solving the synthesis problems that are related to the numerous possible structures
of systems and their parameters, as well as the parameters of the va's themselves,
stipulates the use of analytical methods to investigate the properties of the dif-
ferential equations with harmonic coefficients that describe the operation of va's
and systems containing them.

For the investigation of periodically nonstationary systems, the most fruitful

ideas proved to be those related to the use of a Laplace transform [14]. The com-
plete theory of such linear systems, as presented in [28], makes it possible to de-
rive the parametric transfer functions and the pulse-frequency characteristics of a
nonstationary system. however, the use of these characteristics in engineering cal-
culations is considerably more complicated than the use of normal transfer functions
and the frequency characteristics corresponding to them. The spectral theory of
differential equations with periodic coefficients is explained in the works of v.h.
Taft [34,33] and modified in [16] for the case of two-dimensional systems with amp-
litude modulation. There the result of the solution is presented in the form of an
infinite sequence of determinants, for the formation of which it is required to know
the specific parameters of a system already, which narrows the possibilities of us-
ing this approach. For the purpose of developing the spectral theory, in [27] the
author proposes an algorithm of a rather simple method that is free from the defects
enumerated above and, in principle. makes it possible to obtain stationary transfer
functions of two-dimensional linear systems with periodically changing parameters.
Let us discuss the features of the use of this algorithm in the investigation of
linear differential equations with periodic coefficients and the possibility of
writing their solution analytically {10].

it is not difficult to demonstrate that any linear differential equation with mono-

harmonic coefficients can be represented, with the help of Euler's formula, in the
form

x + (D,(p).re'“’ + lD,(p)xe"" _ R(p)u, (1.31)

-ion operator p and having complex coefficients (in the general case): u - frequency

As the first step in the solution (n - 1), let us perform the following operations.
To the left and right sides of equation (1.31) we will first apply operator e’-“’e and
:hen operator,e'1“t. As a result, we obtain two equations from which the values of
xeiut and xe"“t can be found. Substituting these values into equation (1.31), we

The two cases we have examined do not encompass the entire area of convergence of
the method. However, it can be mentioned here that convergence must take place for
any linear differential equations that describe real physical systems. since the ex-
istence in a system of oscillations with infinite frequency and finite amplitude re-
quires unlimited power resources.

This method can also be used successfully in the more general case, when a linear
differential equation contains coefficients described by a periodic time function.

The realization of the mentioned limiting transition in practice is an extremely
complicated problem. In most cases, however, this is unnecessary, since even the
first steps provide a level of accuracy that is fully adequate for engineering cal-
culations and the higher harmonics can be simply ignored when the filtering proper-
ties of real systems are taken into consideration. The accuracy of the approxima-
tions that have been made can be evaluated easily from the recurrent relationships
that were derived.

The method we have been discussing is convenient for creating standard programs for
digital computers, with the help of which investigations can be conducted of instru-
ments and systems described by linear differential equations with periodic coeffi-
cients.

1.6. Dynamic Characteristics of Rotor Vibration Gyroscope:

t is a well-known fact that the basic properties of automatic systems, as well as
the principles by which they are constructed, are determined essentially by their
sensitive elements' dynamic characteristics. In engineering practice, dynamic char-
acteristics are normally described by transfer functions, which are operators that
convert a signal at an instrument's input into an output signal. For RVG's, the in-
put signal can be assumed to be the vector u of the instantaneous angular velocity
of rotation of the_base in the instrument's sensitivity plane, while the output sig-
nal is the vector u of the signal at the output of the information reading and pro-
cessing system. Let us examine the dynamic characteristics of different RVG sys-
tems.

An RVG with single modulation is described by equations (1.20). Before analyzing an
instrument's dynamic characteristics, it is necessary to represent its equations of
motion in a measuring system of coordinates. For an RVG with single modulation,
such systems are a system of coordinates that is immobile relative to the base and a
system that rotates relative to the base along with the PD's shaft. Using conver-
sion formula (1.11), let us write the equation of motion in the nonrotating system
of coordinates:

The signal is read from the first or second stage's outer rotor on the zero carrier
frequency or a frequency equal to the doubled frequency of rotation. It is possi-
ble to measure the rotors' relative angle of rotation. Besides this, it is possi-
ble to read the signal by measuring the parameters of the motion relative to the
base and to each other of the inner rotors in each stage.

Let us discuss an RVG's transfer functions for reading on the zero carrier frequen-
cy. Assuming the signal filtration provides us with reliable suppression of the

ited, we will discuss only the first components in the right sides of equations

(1.55) and (1.56). Equation (1.55) should be analyzed when reading the signal from
the first rotor. By replacing the operators with their values expressed in terms of
the instrument's parameters, it is easy to see that the free term of the numerator
of the rational expression being derived is identical with zero. The instrument's
transfer function can then be written in the form

If the suspension of the first (counting from the base) rotor possesses rigidities
that are crmnnnsurate with respect to the orthogonal axes in the plane of rotation,

the dynamic tuning condition for a three-rotor MEG is derived from (1.60) by substi-

The intermediate rotor of a three-rotor MRS can be suspended in the same manner. In
this case the dynamic tuning condition is derived by substituting R§2) a 0 into
(1.60).

If a three-rotor M36 is made in such a fashion that the rigidity of the suspension
of the first rotor to the PD's shaft and the subsequent rotors to the preceding ones
is incommensurably greater along one of the orthogonal axes lying in the plane of
rotation than along the other. the dynamic tuning condition can be derived (for ex-
ample) from (1.61) by equating to zero the coefficient for the highest d ree of ri-
gidity, which is moving toward infinity. Assuming, for example, that Céz + a, we

Two-rotor Mac's can also be differentiated among themselves according to the method
by which the elastic suspension of the rotors is realized. When the rigidity of
each rotor's suspension is commensurate with respect to both axes, the tuning condi-
tion is derived from equation (1.61) if in it we set Riz) - 0:

When designing the elastic suspension of a two-rotor MRG's rotors that provides the
VR relative to the PD's shaft and the NR relative to the VR with only one degree of

our generalized VRG model. In this case, the dynamic tuning condition is found
from expression (1.60). if in it we set R{2) - 3(2) - 0, AC2 - 0 and c2 + a. This

When the signal is read on the frequency that equals the rotor's doubled frequency
of rotation, in expressions (1.55) and (1.56) it is necessary to examine the second
terms on the right sides. Then, when describing the instrument's dynamic character-
istics it is necessary to take into consideration the system for splitting the sig-
nal with respect to the sensitivity axes, which is a normal phase demodulator in the
simplest case. Figure 8 is a structural diagram of the conversion of the base's ab-
solute angular velocity of rotation into a signal at the outputs of an va's de-
modulator. Here the fact is taken into consideration that the demodulator is con-
structed on the basis of measurers of the rotor's angles of rotation relative to the
two coordinate axes that are coupled with the base. From expressions (1.55) and
(1.56) it follows that, in general, complete information about the angular velocity
vector is supplied by one angle measurer. However, the use of two such measurers
rakes it possible to realize a demodulating function of the e12m0t type and thereby
(as follows from the structural diagram) get rid of the quadrature component at the
demodulator's outlet. In the case under discussion. the expressions for the signals
at the instrument's outputs can be written in the following form:

“I a - ——_m-m.)——_ w'; (1.69)

As with the case of signal reading on the zero frequency, the transfer function of
such an RVG is a rational expression that is analogous to (1.57). In connection
with this, the dynamic tuning conditions do not depend on the signal reading method
and are determined by expressions (l.60)-(l.68) that we have derived.

Let us derive the transfer functions of an instrument when the _signal is read from
the VR' s of the first and second stages. We will call n1 and n2 the vectors of the

angles of rotation, respectively. of the VR' s of the first and second stages in _in-
ertial space. It is obvious that the following relationships occur for hi and n2:

From expressions (1.75) and (1.76) it follows that when the signal is read from the
VR in the nonrotating system of coordinates that is linked to the base, the reading
can be done on the zero frequency or on a carrier frequency that is the doubled fre-
quency of rotation of the 90's shaft. In connection with this. it is easy to derive
the instrument's transfer functions from expressions (1.75) and (1.76) in a manner
analogous to the derivation of the transfer functions of an instrument when the sig-
nal is read from the NE, while the dynamic tuning conditions coincide with the tun-
ing conditions (1.60)-(l.68) derived above. From expressions (l.73)-(l.76) it is
also easy to derive an avc's transfer functions if the signal is ready by measuring
the rotors' motion relative to each other in the nonrotating system of coordinates.

Let us examine an RVG with single modulation and reading of the useful signal in a
coordinate system that is rotating together with the 90's shaft. Considering trans-
fer formula (l.ll) and an HRG's equations of motion (1.20), the dependence of the
rotors' NR's relative angles of rotation on the base's angular velocity has the form

Figure 9. Structural diagram of MRS with signal reading
on frequency me.

In the rotating system it is possible to take readings only on a carrier frequency
that equals the PD's frequency of rotation. Figure 9 is a structural diagram de-
scribing the operation of an instrument when the signal is read from the first
stage‘s NR and the presence of a phase demodulator at the output is allowed for.
When the signal is read from other rotors, the instrument's structural diagram takes
on an analogous form. Depending on the methods used to construct the demodulator's
circuitry, two reference functions can be realized in it: e‘iwot and eiwot. It
should be mentioned here that the realization of such reference functions is possi-
ble only in the presence of two rotor rotation angle measurers located on mutually
orthogonal axes in the instrument's plane of sensitivity. In the first case, when
the demodulator uses reference function e-iwot' the instrument's transfer function
coincides with the analogous one derived for signal reading on the zero frequency in
the nonrotating system of coordinates, and is described by the first terms on the
right sides of expressions (1.55) and (1.56). If the reference function used is
elwot, the instrument's transfer function is identical to the one derived for signal
reading in the nonrotating system on the carrier frequency that is double the fre-
quency of rotation of the 90's shaft.

signal reading in the rotating system of coordinates is also possible with the use
of only one measurer of the rotor's angle of rotation relative to one of the measur-
ing axes lying in the instrument's plane of sensitivity. The structural diagram of
aﬁ RVG corresponding to this case is shown in Figure 10. Depending on which suspen-
sion axis the measures is attached to, the signal entering the demodulator is pro-
portional to either RexB or Imin. The first case corresponds to the upper signs in
the operators of the linear part of the structural diagram. while the second corres-
ponds to the lower ones. In turn, either .iwot or e-iuot can be used as the refer-
ence function. The instrument's transfer functions for each of these cases can be
derived easily on the basis of this structural diagram. The structural diagram of

n instrument where the signal is read from the RVG's other rotors has an analogous
form.

simplest of them is a single-rotor Mac with
VP, a diagram of which is shown in Figure
11. The elastic suspension of rotor R is
fashioned in such a manner that the flexur-
al rigidity of torsion bars T is signifi-
cantly greater than their torsional rigidi-
ty, which in the first approximation can be
assumed to be infinite. we determine the
transfer function of such an instrument
from the general equations, equating to re-
ro the moments of inertia of the second
stage's VR and NR and the first stage's VR
and directing toward infinity the suspen-
sion's rigidity along the second stage's
axes and the rigidity of the first stage's
suspension along one of the axes, such as
cél . As a result. by omitting the indices
we obtain the transfer function for an 0H6

when the signal is read in the nonrotating system of coordinates:

It should be mentioned here that when the signal is read on the zero frequency and
when it is read on the doubled frequency of rotation of the PD, the instrument‘s
transfer functions prove to be identical to within the accuracy of the sign. In the
rotating system, signal reading is possible only on frequency “0 with the help of an
angle sensor that measures the rotor's rotation relative to the torsion bars' axis.
in connection with this, the instrument's transfer function differs from expression
(1.81) only in that its transfer factor is twice as large.

One of the most important characteristics of an RVG is its transfer factor Kg with
respect to the base's angular velocity at a stable speed. Por instruments of the
type under discussion, Kg is determined from (1.81):

while the instrument's transfer factor in the dynamic tuning mode will become

Thus, this NRC is described by an aperiodic component element with a time constant

From (1.96) it follows that when the base‘s motion develops spasmodically, the mo-
tion of an MRG's rotor consists of a slow (precessional) motion toward a steady-
state position and nutationai oscillations that are superimposed on it. The preces-
sionai motion is caused by the presence of viscous friction along the suspension ax-
cs. In connection with this, the projection of the rotor's pole moves along an at-
tenuating spiral in the pictorial plane. The precessional motion's angular frequen-
cv, as referred to the PD's angular velocity, is

Thus. the precessional motion of the rotor of an OMG with two degrees of freedom of
the suspension in the plane of rotation proves to be analogous to the motion of an
0M6 rotor with one degree of freedom. The only difference is the absence of nuta-
tional oscillations in the latter. The relative frequency of the nutational oscil-
lations is determined from the expression

When such an instrument is used in automatic control systems, nutational oscilla-
tions in the system's band of essential frequencies can have unfavorable consequen-
ces. Therefore, it is desirable to select the instrument's parameters in such a
manner that vH be as large as possible.

A component in the numerator of transfer function (1.96) defines the 0046's reaction

to angular accelerations in the base's motion. The ratio of the instrument's trans-
fer factor with respect to acceleration K“ to the transfer factor with respect to

tion. The larger the transfer factors are, the greater this nonidentity. In
connection with this, according to its c aracteristics the instrument is obviously

close to the OMG discussed above that has a single degree of freedom in the plane of
sensitivity.

When the signal is read on frequency “0 in
the rotating system of coordinates, the in-
strument's transfer functions are the same

as when it is read on the zero frequency in
the nonrotating system.

Let us discuss the dynamic characteristics
of a two-rotor modulation gyroscope. The
simplest DHG layout is the one where the
VR is suspended from the PD's shaft and the
NR is suspended from the VR with the help
of torsion bars with one degree of freedom
(for all practical purposes). This layout

is depicted in Figure 12. when the signal

In conclusion, let us examine the layout of a TMG [three-rotor modulation gyroscope]
with the outer rotor on the zero frequency, for which the suspension of each rotor
has only one degree of freedom on the zero frequency. We will limit ourselves to
the case where the suspension of the second stage's inner and intermediate rotors is
orthogonal. Assuming the absence of a first-stage VR in the generalized model, so

CHAPTER 2. DEFECTS IN ROTOR VIBRATION GYROSCOPES

2.1. Reaction of Rotor Vibration Gyroscopes to Harmonic Vibrations of the Base at a
Frequency Equal to the Doubled Frequency of Rotation of a Rotor

Accuracy of measurement and threshold of sensitivity of gyroscopic instruments are
extremely important characteristics. on which the possibility of using them to solve
certain navigational problems basically depends. The accuracy of an RVG depends on
the errors engendered in the mechanical part and the errors in the information read-
ing and processing system. The sensitivity threshold is determined by the zero
noise level at the instrument's output; that is, by the signal that is available at
the output and is completely identical to the useful signal in the absence of a
measured angular velocity of the base. as well as the possibility of distinguishing
the useful signal against the background of this noise. Errors in the sensor of the
angular rotation of an va's sensitive element and the information processing system
are the subject of research in special branches of technology. so in this chapter we
will limit ourselves to a discussion of the errors that arise only in the mechanical
part of an instrument, assuming that its information reading and processing system
is functioning ideally.

RVG errors can be methodological. operational. or technological. The first type is
related to special features of their operation on an arbitrarily moving base that is
subjected to angular and linear vibrations and overloads; the second, to a change
during the operating process of the values of their basic parameters; the third, to
the effect on an instrument's sensitive elements of disturbing moments caused by in—
accuracy during production and tuning. In general form, let us discuss several of
these errors--those typical of most RVG setups--using an RVG with single modulation
as an example.

From the generalized mathematical model of an RVG with single modulation and a ro-
tating suspension (l.2C), it follows that angular vibrations of the base on a fre-
quency equal to the doubled frequency of rotation of the PD's shaft lead to angular
deflections of the sensitive elements. which means the appearance at the instru-
ment's output of a signal that is identical to the signal caused by some constant
angular Velocity ”e of the base.

:et us discuss how to determine the value of a; for different layouts of HRG's with

VP. we will assume that the instrument's base is performing angular oscillations in
its sensitivity plane, the velocity vector of which is determined oy the expression

From (1.56) it follows that when the signal is read on the zero frequency of the
nonrotating system of coordinates. the angle of rotation of N31 relative to the base
is determined by the expression

‘ - %_,MJ”+V"0+MMW.m-.
1?-11- W—h—Wﬂ—w A. (2.2)

The constant angular velocity of the base in the instrument's plane of sensitivity,
which can be found from (1.56). also leads to rotation of N31 at some angle A“, so
that angular vibrations of the instrument's base at frequency Zuo will lead to the

appearance at its output of a signal that is identical (equivalent) to the signal
rom the base' s constant angular velocity u.:

we will assume that the amplitude of the vibrations is constant and ignore damping
with respect to the suspension axes. For an OHG, the equivalent angular velocity
then equals

. l (l—xﬂvé—(l—xp' H
”“3 3‘“: z a “A- (2.4)

If the rotor has a uniformly rigid suspension (CC nca ), the equivalent angular ve-
locity equals zero; that is, with a level of accuracy3 up to that of the assumptions
hat have been made the instrument has no error related to angular vibrations of the
base on frequency 220. For an OMG with a single degree of freedom of the rotor's
suspenSion from ’10 90' s shaft, the dependence on the amplitude of the rate of vi-
bration acquires the form

l—x -.
-2h? |—'+x“’4 (2.5)

:n this case. a reduction in instrument error can be achieved only be reducing the
value of 1 o‘x by the appropriate choice of the rotor's geometric configuration that
also results in a reduction in the rigidity C of the torsion bars.

For a 5M6 having two degrees of freedom in the sensitivity plane, the equivalent an-

gular velocity for base vibrations at frequency Zuo is determined by the expression

The smaller the values of l - R2 , l - KY and 31' which are determined by the geo-
metrical dimensions of the NR and VR, the smaller the error in a DMG. Instrument
:ro: also depends on the angle 912 between the NR's and VR's suspension axes in the
:ttors' plane of rotation.

Let us examine the possibility of achieving a substantial reduction in this error by
:noosing the :MG's structural parameters appropriately. In order to do this it is
necessary to have such relationships between the instrument‘s parameters that the

numerator of expression (2.6) changes to zero, while the denominator is represented
by some finite number. Such physically real conditions can be obtained only for the

60
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

cases ‘12 = o and 612 - n/2, the first of which corresponds to an orthogonal posi-
tioning of the axes, as was shown in Figure 12, while the second corresponds to a
coaxial positioning of the torsion bars connecting the PD with the VR and the VR
with the NR. Analysis shows that for a DMG of the Khaui type, with identical rigid-
ities of the inner and outer suspensions’ torsion bars (AC - O), the requirement
that the numerator of expression (2.6) change to zero is incompatible with resonance
tuning condition (1.66). Therefore, for instruments of this type operating in the
dynamic tuning mode, the error caused by angular vibrations of the base at frequency
230 cannot, in principle, be eliminated by the proper selection of their parameters.

In the case of a coaxial positioning of the torsion bars' axes and resonance tuning,
the numerator of expression (2.6) becomes zero when the following relationships of
the instrument's parameters are observed:

‘ : _‘-’R.('-*v) . (2.7)

V2--‘2& véa-o. (2.8)

?rom (2.7) and (2.8) it follows that the degree of rigidity with respect to one of
the suspension axes must be zero. This means that on one of the DHG's suspension
axes it is necessary to install supports that do not impose any elastic moments on
the rocors. However, all known types of mechanical supports that have a sufficiem

ly high load-bearing capacity also have "dry" friction, and are practically unsuita-
ble for a precision gyroscope of the RVG type.

when the suspension axes are arranged orthogonally. the conditions of equality to
zero of the numerator of expression (2.6) for an instrument operating in the dynamic
tuning mode have the following form in the presence of angular vibrations of the
base (2.5):

.~ I _- 2R1‘l —XyI
\c 0. v3- m , (2.9)

O:

v'53:)0""l-I_'l£l"\' "i=2U-xy). (2'10)
(u I
Conditions (2. 9) coincide with conditions (2.7) and, as was s -ated above, are of no
practical interest. Conditions (2.10) can be easily realized in practice. In con-
nection with this, however, the denominator of expression (2.6) also becomes zero.
In order to evaluate the inde' -erminacy that is being obtained, we should allow {or
damping with respect to the gyroscope' s suspension axes. The instrument' s transfer
factor with respect to the base' 3 angular ve-ocity then takes on the form

Thus. according to condition (2.10), during dynamic tuning an instrument does not
acquire the characteristics that are typical of the resonance mode. primarily in-
dependence of K9 on the angular velocity of rotation ”0 and an inversely proportion-
a; dependence or Kg on the coefficients of viscous friction along the suspension ax-
es. Therefore. we will call this mode "pseudoresonance."

An analogous mode occurs for an OHG when conditions (1.90) are fulfilled and for a
DMG with coaxial positioning of the torsion bars when conditions (2.8) are ful-
filled. In the pseudoresonance mode an instrument's transfer factor can be in-
creased neticeably by selecting the rotor's parameters appropriately so that Ky * l
and X2“ * 1. However. it is necessary to reduce the suspension's rigidities in this

I: is also possible to reduce DMG errors caused by angular vibrations of the base
when operating in the pseudoresonance mode by choosing the damping value and the ro-
tor geometry properly. In connection with this, it is necessary to keep in mind the
fa at that the creation and preservation of a certain relationship between the ex-
tremelv small coefficients of viscous friction along the suspension axes is hardly
assibie at the present time.

t us discuss a DMG in which the NR's suspension from the VR or the VR's from the
'5 5r .aft has two degrees of freedom. In the first case, the numerator of the op-

The simultaneous fulfillment of conditions (2.17) and (2) I 0 or (2.18) and (2.19)

quired in the first case.

For a one in which the VR' s suspension from the PD' 3 shaft has two degrees of free-

Thus, when relationships (2.22) and (2.23) are realized in the resonance mode, the
instrument error caused by angular vibrations of the base at frequency Zoo will be
extremely small. These conditions are not closed relative to the rigidity values.
For certain relationships of the rings' moments of inertia, the rigidity along one
of the suspension axes can be assigned arbitrarily on the basis of some additional
considerations, although in this case conditions of realizability consisting of the
simultaneous fulfillment of inequalities C3 > O, CéZ) > 0 and Cc > 0 must be provid-
ed.

For a CMG in which the VR's and Na's suspensions have two degrees of freedom in the
plane of rotation, the necessary condition for the equality to zero of the error
caused by angular oscillations of the base at frequency Zuo, given the absence of
moments of viscous friction, is written in the following form:

If the realization of the dynamic tuning mode is achieved by fulfillment of rela-
tionships (1.131} and (1.132) among t.e instrument's parameters, an additional con-
dition that makes it possible to achieve a substantial reduction in the effect on
its accuracy of angular vibrations at frequency 2uo is

RII) _Rm_ (2.31)

Fulfillment of this condition entails some structural complications. but in princi-
ple it is possible.

Thus. for modulation RVG's having two or more raters, when the signal is read in a
nonrotating system of coordinates on the zero carrier frequency, it is possible to
select the parameters such that in the resonance tuning mode. a significant reduc-
tion of the instrument's sensitivity to angular vibrations of the base with a fre-
quency of 230 is insured.

For an M36 with signal reading on a frequency equal to the doubled frequency of to-
tation of the rotor Zmo, angular vibrations of the base in the instrument's plane of
sensitiv:ty on this same frequency alsu result in a signal that is equivalent to a
signal :aused by the base's constant angular velocity. Actually. suppose that the
base's anguia: vibrations are described by expression (2.1).

Then, allowing for the demodulator, the slowly changing component of the signal at

the instrument's outlet has the form

In connection with this, signal (2.1) from the base's angular vibrations will be to-
tally identical to the signal from some slowly changing angular velocity 6;, which
is determined by the expression

In order for there to be no error it is necessary that in the instrument there be

realized that relationship among the basic parameters so that the right side of
(2.33) becomes zero.

As an example, let us examine in some detail several specific setups of «30‘s with

signal reading on frequency 2mg. An OMG's error when there are angular vibrations
of the base is found from the relationship

6;- I (”ﬁe—*(‘m- (2.34)
('+"Y)VZ:-('+*z)"3

This error can be reduced only by reducing the values of l - 1y and l - xz. The

closer to each other the values along the suspension axes are, the greater the ad-

duced instrument error, which is explained by the reduction in their transfer factor
with respect to the useful signal.

or a DMG, the suspension of each of the rings of which has only one degree of free-
cm in the plane of rotation, the expression determining the equivalent velocity 6;

:n contrast to a 0M6 with signal reading on the zero frequency. in this case the er-
ror does tat depend on the angle 912 between the suspension axes in the plane of ro-
tation. A joint examination of the condition of low instrument sensitivity with re-
spect to the base's constant angular vibrations (2.1) (a; k 0) and dynamic tuning
:cndition (1.66) shows that the simultaneous fulfillment of these conditions is pos-
sxhle only when a nonelastic suspension is realized for one of the rings (Ca - 0 or
C-' 0).

When the signal is read in a rotating system of coordinates on frequency me, two
cases are possible, depending on the type of reference function used.in the demodu-
Lator. In one of them, where the reference function has the form e'*“°‘, the ex-
;ression for the instrument error for angular vibrations of the base on frequency
243 coincides with expression (2.3). In the second case, where the reference func-
tion e“0c is used, the instrument error will be determined by expression (2.33).

Starting with the generalized mathematical model of an RVG, in a manner analogous to
the previously discussed cases it is easy to derive expressions for the computation

of modulation RVG errors caused by angular vibrations of the base at frequency Zwo

when the signal is read from the intermediate suspension rings in any measuring sys-
tem of coordinates.

2.2. Reaction of Rotor Vibration Gyroscope: to Disturbing Moments

No actually existing instrument can be manufactured with ideal accuracy. During the
building of instrument assemblies and the assembly and regulation of the instrument
as a whole, some deviations from the given rated parameters are usually allowed.

Such deviations also appear when the instrument is used. One of the consequences of

this can be the appearance of disturbing moments that affect a gyroscope and result
in additional errors.

Let us investigate the errors caused in modulation RVG's by the effect on them of
the mechanical part of disturbing moments. From the generalized mathematical model
of an RVG (1.20) it follows that when disturbing moments are acting on a gyroscope.
the motion in inertial space of the first stage‘s (for example) rotor is described
by the expression

2. =- 717, w” (p) W" + MWes'W') +

+ WI: (p) (5—H! Ire-520.1 + ‘59"ﬁzlve-Iﬁ!) + (2 . 36)
* WI: (p) (Til?) + Eyre-no.1) + IV" (ﬁm‘e-nml + Maire-no.1) I

From (2.36) it is obvious that the creation of an H36 that is totally invariant when
acted upon by disturbing moments is impossible in principle, since the requirement
that all the terms in the numerator on the right side of the equation equal zero
automatically results in a requirement that its denominator also equals zero.

Let us discuss, in sequence. the errors caused in different types of M36 setups by
the effect of different types of disturbing moments. Let the first-stage rotor be
subjected to the effect of a conStan: or slowly changing moment ﬁ‘l’. The reason
for the appearance of this moment can be displacement of the rotor's center of mass,
relative to the suspension axes, along the axis of :otation and the presence of con-
stant or slowly changing linear accelerations of the base, the vector of which lies
in a plane perpendicular to the rotor's axis of rotation. In this case, in the non-
rotating system of coordinates the rotor can be deflected through some angle and
perform oscillations with a frequency of Zoo around this angle. When the signal is
read in the nonrotating system of coordinates on the zero frequency, the instru-

ment's error will be determined by the expression

2' 3%}711)‘ (2.37)

It is obvious that in this case, as in the case when angular vibrations of the base
act on an instrument, it is convenient to represent the MRG's error in the term of

an equivalent angular velocity, the signal from which is completely identical to the
signal from an acting disturbing moment:

The larger the rotor's moment of inertia relative to the axis of the torsion bars

and the higher the rotor's frequency of rotation, the smaller this error will be.

In the case of two degrees of freedom in the one, its error when effected by moment

Thus, the one error caused by disturbing moment Eu) cannot be eliminated. It can

be reduced by the proper selection of the instrument's parameters and by reducing
the disturbing moment itself.

freedom is described by the expression '

In order to build an instrument that is not sensitive to moment Eu) it is necessary
that its parameters have values for which expression (2.41) becomes zero. The con-

dition of equality of the numerator of (2.41) to zero is fulfilled for the following
relationship between the rigidities of the rings' suspension:

Cc - ~42an -,- 1mm? - ca. (2.42)

It is not difficult to see that equality (2.42) is satisfied for the rigidity values
determined from expressions (2.10) , and in connection with this the denominator of
(2.41) also becanes zero; that is. the instrument operates in a pseudoresonance
mode. In order to find the error in this case, we should take into consideration

the viscous friction acting on the suspension axes. The expression for equivalent
angular velocity 3e then takes on the form

 

W'- (2.43)

Thus. when operating in a pseudoresonance mode. a mac realized according to the dia-

gram shown in Figure 12, with a rotor that is acted upon by constant disturbing mo-

It is also fulfilled when conditions (2.16) and (2.19) are observed, since they make
it possible to reduce the instrument's sensitivity to angular vibrations with a fre-

quency of Zuo. If the VR's suspension from the PD's shaft has two degrees of free-
dome and)¢12 I 0, the nontrivial conditions for DMG invariance to the effect of mo-
ment §(1 in the resonance tuning mode is written in the following form:

These conditions turn out to be incoapatible with the conditions of low sensitivity
to angular vibrations of the base with a frequency of Zoo. Therefore, and depending

on the instruments' operating conditions, their parameters must satisfy either rela-
tionships (2.21) and (2.22) or relationships (2.45) and (2.46).

For a DHG in which each rotor has two degrees of freedom; the condition for the ab-
sence of error caused by disturbing moment M(1) is determined by the expression

When each of the rotors has a uniformly rigid suspension, this condition is ful-
filled when the condition of dynamic tuning of the instrument is.

Cbndition (2.55), together with dynamic tuning condition (1.62) and the condition
for low sensitivity to angular vibrations of the base on frequency 2mg. makes it
possible to select the optimum parameters for an instrument that is being designed.

For an M36 with.signal reading in a rotating system of coordinates on frequency “0'

(2.56) coincides with expression (2.52) for all practical purposes; that is. the er-
ror caused by harmonic moment 3‘1) with frequency 2wo for an instrument with reading
on the zero frequency is equivalent to the error of an HRS with reading on frequency
2mg that appears when the constant disturbing moment M(1) acts upon it. When the
signal is read on frequency Zuo, the expressions for CNS and and error coincide, re-
spectively, with expressions (2.53) and (2.54). In this case the instruments‘ er-
rors do not depend on the signal-reading method. For a Th5 with one-stage ring sus-

es. there will be an error expressed by the presence at its outlet of a signal that
is equivalent to the signal from some constant angular velocity 6 only if these mo-
ments are of a harmonic type with the frequency of rotation ”0 of the rotor. These
moments include. for example. moments caused by static disbalance of the VR along
the 90's axis of rotation and the effect in the plane of rotation of constant line-
ar overloads and vibrations with a frequency of :“O' as well as moments generated by
static nonequilibrium of the rotors relative to the suspension axes and linear vi-
brations of the base along the axis of rotation at frequency ”0°

When conditions (2.10) are fulfilled, the instrument operates in a pseudoresonance
node and the numerator and denominator of expression (2.65) simultaneously become
zero. Therefore. in order to reveal the indeterminacy that is obtained in expres-
sion (2.61) . it is necessary to take into consideration the damping along the ro-
tors' suspension axes.

Expression (2.66), together with expression (1.127) for an instrument's transfer

factor, makes it possible to determine the equivalent angular velocity as when dis-
turbing moments (2.59) are acting on the suspension axes. The errors in DHG's hav-
ing signal reading on the zero frequency and a two-stage suspension of the NR from

the VR and the VR from the PD's shaft can also be found with the help of expression
(2.66) and the corresponding expressions for transfer factor . In order to do

this, in (2.66) we should set Rfl) = 0 in the first case and R32) - 0 in the second.

The expressions presented in this section make it possible, when the disturbing mo-

gular velocity of the base. as well as their dependence on the instruments' basic

parameters. The latter fact can be used when designing specific instruments with
the r- i red accuracy characteristics when operating under given real conditions.
1.3. Operating Errors in Rotor Vibration Gyroscopes

One of the important properties of instruments is their ability to maintain their
basic characteristics with given limits when they are in operation. Actually, when

74

affected by a change in temperature, instability of the power supply, material prop-
erties that change with time and other factors, the values of instrument parameters
and, consequently, basic instrument characteristics can change during the Operating
process. The effect of these factors on the characteristics of RVG‘s is particular-
ly noticeable, since their basic operating mode is the resonance tuning mode, with
very little damping, which makes them extremely sensitive to even an insignificant
change in their parameters. When designing such instruments, therefore, it is ne-
cessary to devote particular attention to the possibility of insuring their stable
operation under given real conditions.

Let us discuss how small changes in parameters affect the basic characteristics of
an M36. The basic characteristic of an MRS is its transfer factor with respect

to the base's angular velocity, which is a function of the rigidities' of the ro-
tcrs' suspensions, the rings' moments of inertia and the PD's frequency of rotation:

. 'l ‘I ‘ I I; u n‘ u‘

[(3- K}(C‘a . C2". :15.- In" in. Inn/'2‘), lln"”l)- ‘_ I, 2_ _ _ . II. (2.75)
During operation, these parameters can deviate from their rated values; that is,
some small increments appear. In order to evaluate the effect of these increments

on a change in the transfer factor, let us make use of methods from the theory of
sensitivity [37].

The basic factor affecting a change in the value of K9 will be detuning of the in-
strument from the resonance mode. The transfer factor can be written in the follow-
ing form:

RQzI.-:-5Im A,

KV‘ 'R__es.-.uma.v (2.76)

while the instrument's dynamic tuning condition has the form Re 30 I o. If, during
operation, there occur deviations of the instrument parameters listed above from
their rated values. the expression for Re so can be written as

Re Bo}: RCVBnIae‘JI'I" ;\('-\0.). (2.77)

where Aai = deviations of the instrument's parameters from their rated values, while
i characterizes the detuning of the instrument from the resonance mode that arises
in connection with this. Substituting (2.77) into expression (2.76) and assuming
that th p rameters' rated values corresponded to resonance tuning, we obtain the
expression for the instrument's transfer feator when it is detuned from the reso-

nance mode:
. A
“Hm:
-—-—-—§——T- (2.78)

”(r-arr)-

where Kg. a the instrument's transfer factor in the resonance tuning mode. Thus,
when the instrument is detuned its trans! r factor is reduced by a factor of

i + (A/ZmBg)2. In addition to this, as a result of the detuning there appears a
cross component of th transfer factor, it being the case that the larcer the ratio
t/Imsg is, the larger it is.

K: .. A",

It is completely obvious that the more sensitive an instrument is to detuning from
the resonance mode, the higher its sensitivity with respect to the base's angular
velocity (and the lower the coefficient of viscous friction along the suspension
axes).

The expressions for the senstivity functions make it possible to find, for each in-
strument, the dependence of its sensitivity on a possible change in the basic param-
eters. Along with the expressions describing an instrument's transfer factor and
dynamic characteristics. as well as its basic errors, the sensitivity functions are
initial expressions for synthesizing an va's basic parameters. All other condi-
tions being equal, it is desirable to have those instrument parameters for which its
sensitivity functions will be minimal. Starting with the sensitivity functions and
the requirements for an instrument, the allowances for changes in its basic parame-
ters under real operating conditions are calculated.

2.4. Errors in a Single-Rotor Modulation Gyroscope

Figure 13. Systems of coordinates.

In the preceding sections of this chapter we have discussed errors in MRG's with V?
in general form. As an example. let us investigate in more detail the errors in the
simplest of the mac's: a single-rotor modulation gyroscope with rotating suspen-
sion, a diagram of which was presented in Figure ll. Let us discuss the mathemati-
cal model of the operation of such an instrument, allowing for the basic technologi-
cal errors in its construction. In order to do this, we will introduce the follow-
ing systems of coordinates (Figure 13):

OoxoYozo--a system of coordinates coupled with the instrument's base:

00x2Y222-—a system of coordinates coupled with the PD's shaft:

02 iYéZ§-~a system of coordinates, the 0225 axis of which coincides with the torsion
bars' axis, while the °2Y§ axis lies in the torsion bars' plane of rotation;
02x1Y121--a system of coordinates coupled with the torsion bars;

oxiYizi--a system of coordinates with its origin at the rotor's center of mass and
axes that are parallel to the axes of system Olelelx

78

cx¥z--a system of coordinates, the axes of which coincide with the rotor's main axes
of inertia, while its origin is at the rotor's center of mass.

Among the basic technological errors in the production of the instrument we can in-
elude:

the presence of some distance I between the motor shaft's axis of rotation and the
torsion bars' axis;

static disbalance of the rotor, characterized by the coordinates ax, ay, a2 of its
center of mass in the system of coordinates coupled with the torsion bars:

dynamic disbalance of the rotor, characterized by angles 7x, yy, *2-

The gyroscope‘s rotor can be suspended from the PD's shaft with the help of torsion
bars of different designs. In connection with this, the general requirement is that
the torsion bars' :lexural rigidity exceed substantially their torsional rigidity.
Assuming that this is observed in a real design. we will consider only the angular
motion of the rotor relative to the torsion bars' axis. Assuming that the values of

ax, ay. az and Yx. Yy. Yz. as well as angle #. are sufficiently small and retaining

in the equation of motion only terms of no higher than the second order of small-
ness, we obtain

For arbitrary motion of the base, equation (2.92) is a non-steady-state one and its
exact solution entails considerable difficulties. Therefore, let us take advantage
of the method of successive approximations, which is widely used in gyroscopy {13].
Ignoring the terms or the higher order of smallness in the right side of (2.92), we

rotor when the base is in motion. In order to find the motion of the CMG's rotor in
the second approximation, we place the solution of the equation of the first approx-

tion on the right side of equation (2.93) and solve the linear differential equa-
tion that is obtained, keeping only terms of the second order of smallness in the
right side.

we will conduct our investigation of errors after provisionally dividing them into
three groups: methodical, instrumental and operational.

Expressions for the signals at the instrument's output, in the presence of harmonic
rocking of the base around the axes of sensitivity in the frequency pass band, can
be derived from its transfer function (1.81) by replacing p with imo. If, for exam-
ple, the base performs oscillations around the OOYO axis:

(I’ve-(”v.99 0”. (2.94)
the signals at the CMG's demodulator's output have the form

From expressions (2.95) it follows that when there is harmonic rocking of the in-
strument's base, along with the basic signal (at the demodulator's first outlet)
there appears a cross signal (at the second outlet). the magnitude of which with re-
spect to the basic one increases as the frequency of the base's oscillations rises.

As was already stated in Section 2.1, a characteristic feature of RVG's operating on
the principle of amplitude modulation is that when there are harmonic oscillations
of the base in the instrument's plane of sensitivity that are on frequencies close
to 22”, at its outlets there appear error signals that are identical to useful sig-
nals from slowly changing angular velocities of the base.

The equivalent angular velocity of the base’s motion can be found from expression
;:.3). while for frequencies equal to Zoo it is found from expression (2.5). with
the given instrument accuracy, from (2.5) it is easy to obtain the allowable ampli-
tudes of the case's angular oscillations with frequency 2wo at the point where the
instrument is mounted.

Let us discuss the methodical error that occurs in an 3M6 when there is angular mo-
tion of the case relative to the three axes. Without disrupting the commonality, we

to an axis that coincides with the rotor's axis of rotation. The smaller 5 (the
greater the instrument's sensitivity) and the rotor's angular velocity we are, the
greater this error is.

An evaluation of the additional error that occurs in connection with low-frequency
rocking of the base. as made with expression (2.96). shows that this error is ex-
tremely small and does not have to be allowed for in connection with the real param-
eters involved in the rocking of objects and the real requirements for instrument
accuracy. When there is angular vibration of the base, the error signal is evaluat-
ed with the simple expression

The error under discussion, which is caused by angular vibrations of the base, oc-

curs only when the vibrations take place around an axis that does not coincide with
the rotor's axis of rotation and does not lie in the plane of sensitivity.

Thus, expressions (2.97)-(2.100) make it possible to evaluate an instrument's me-
thodical error when it is operating on a movable base. One of the basic factors re-
sulting in instrument error is the presence of static disbalance of the rotor (Fig-
ure 13). In this case, when the instrument is operating on a base that is subjected
to linear accelerations and vibrations, its rotor is affected by disturbing moments
that, in accordance with the results presented in Section 2.2, lead to the appear—
ance or error signals at the instrument's outlets. In the presence of static dis-
balance along the rotor's axis of rotation (characterized by coordinate ax) and con-
stant or slowly changing accelerations in the plane of sensitivity jzyc, these error

signals, expressed in terms 0: equivalent angular velocities of the base, are de-
scribed by the expressions

Practical calculations show that high 0H6 accuracy (on the order of lo"2 °/h) under

auditions of overloads of up to 10 g and more requires that the static balance
along the rotor's axis of rotation be insured with an accuracy of several angstr ms.
Such high balancing accuracy can be achieved only by the use of special methods hat
utilize the system for measuring the rotor's angle of rotation that is already
available in the instrument.

The value c! the interference signal for identical overloads is of the same order as
when constant linear accelerations are affecting the instrument. In order to reduce
this interference it is possible to cushion the instrument, when the parameters of
:ne disturbances are known, to select the rotor's angular velocity so that the vi-
bration overloads in the area of frequenc1es no and 2mg will be minimal. In addi-

tion to this, there exist special methods for reducing this interference [32].

When linear accelerations and vibrations act simultaneously along all three axes of

an instrument, the error signal's additional component can be expressed in terms of

It should be mentioned here that in the case of instrument operation on a vibrating
base, in addition to those that have already been discussed. in it there can appear
additional interference signals with the following relationships of the frequencies
of the angular and linear vibrations and the rotor's rotation frequency [5]:

The magnitude of these errors is much less than those presented above. However.
when designing an instrument the value of mo should be chosen so as to reduce as

much as possible the intensity of the vibrations close to the frequencies found
from (2. 105) .

An investigation of the effect of dynamic disbalance of the rotor on instrument er-
ror showed that it is negligibly small for the basic signal and can be manifested
only as some increase in the level of the cross signal that appears when there are
constant angular velocities of the base and that, in connection with this. is
smaller than the basic signal by a factor of [l/Zyxl/[Iz(l + xz)/(Iz - Iy)].

During the analysis of methodical 0M6 errors it was shown that one of the basic
causes of instrument error is angular vibrations of the base with a frequency of
zoo. In practice, such vibrations are inherent in any rotating bodies, as well as
the rotating part of an CNG. In connection with this. it has been proven experi-
mentally that the vibrations' amplitude depends on the quality of the realization
of the supports and the dynamic and static distalance of the CHG's rotating part.
In :13] the author presents a quite complete technique for investigating the reac-
tion of ball-bearing supports to the appearance of vibrations caused by rotating
bodies. fherefore. here we will examine the effect of static and dynamic dis-
balance on the appearance of angular vibrations with a frequency of Zwo in the ro-
tating part of an CMG. It is obvious that such a phenomenon takes place when there
is varying rigidity in different radial directions in the main rotation supports.

Let the radial rigidity of the main rotation supports be different in different di-
rections. We will designate the radial rigidity of the left support as C01 and
that of the right support as C02 (Figure 14). In the case of an infinitely rigid

In the presence of a force acting in a plane perpendicular to the main axis of rota-
tion, from the side of the supports the rotor will be acted on by reaction moment
M9, the vector of which lies in the same plane and is perpendicular to the force's
victor. Let us determine the moments acting on the rotor in the system of coordi-
nates that is rotating along with it. Let Q be the force generated by the static
disbalance of the GHG's rotating part, while “d is the moment generated by its dy-

namic disbalance (Figure 14). According to [211, the expressions for Q and Md have
the form

The radial rigidity of the supports is not the same in different directions because
of nonuniformity of the material's properties, deviations of the geometric shapes of
the supports' elements from the ideal, and the nonlinear dependence of the supports'
pliability on the stresses. Thus, radial rigidity can be regarded as a periodic
function of angle 9 - wot, with period 2!.

Considering what has been said above, along with conditions (2.113) and (2.114), let

Analogous expressions can also be derived for the relationships 9 and "d! as well as
angle A.

In order to determine the OMG error caused by nonuniformity of the supports' rigidi-
ty and disbalance of the instrument's rotating part, it is necessary to find the
projections of angular velocities $9 and up on the instrument's axes of sensitivity
and substitute them into expression (2.5). Overloading in the instrument's plane of
sensitivity also results in the appearance of an error when the supports' radial ri-
gidity is not uniform. Its magnitude can be evaluated with the technique presented
above. The technical measures contributing to a reduction in the error can be as
follows:

careful dynamic and static balancing of the rotating part;

increasing the angular rigidity of the main rotation supports;

reducing the value of the angular nonuniformity of the supports' rigidity, which can
be achieved by reducing the permissible tolerances for the geometrical shape of the
supports' elements, properly selecting the bearings and the “favorable“ mutual ori-
entation of their outer rings, and creating the appropriate axial tightness.

In conclusion, let us discuss the CMG error arising because of a change in the in-
strument's basic parameters while it is in operation. As has already been pointed
out in Section 2.3, the basic source of this error is the disruption of resonance

tuning. In accordance with (2.79), detuning for an 0M6 is determined by the expres-
sion

' ~ 3C \\I . d .

where U0, c. I2, Xz - rated values of the parameters insuring resonance tuning of an
0M6.

From (2.122) it follows that in order to achieve a substantial reduction in the ef-
fect of a change in an instrument's basic parameters on its detuning from the reso--
nance mode, it is necessary to provide a rotor configuration such that xz * 1. If
the changes in the parameters arise as the result of changes in the temperature con-
ditions, detuning can be reduced by seleCting the appropriate materials for the ro-
tor and the torsion bars (31].

Detuning from the resonance mode leads to a change in an instrument's transfer fac-
tor that, in accordance with (2.78), can be determined from the expression

In order to maintain stable operation of a highly sensitive instrument it is neces-
sary that the condition A << i be fulfilled when it is in operation.

From an analysis of CMG errors it follows that a significant reduction can he
achieved in them by adopting a structural solution in which 22 r 1. However, from
the dynamic tuning condition it follows that in this case the torsion bars' torsion-
al ri;idity will converge on zero. Reducing the torsion bars' torsional rigidity
results in a reduction in their load-bearing capacity; that is, their capability to
insure the instrument's nondestructability and ability to operate under large con-
stant, impact and vibrational overloads.

Figure 15. Torsion bar cross-sections.

Let us discuss the dependence of the strength characteristics of torsion bars on an
instrument's other parameters. Torsion bars are usually made in the form of tension
members that are either in one piece with the rotor or are made separately and then
press-fitted into it. Torsion bars can have cross-sections of various shapes. They
are most frequently circular. rectangular or cross-shaped (Figure 15). when their
cross-section is constant throughout their entire length it and there is no axial
tightening. the torsional rigidity of such torsion bars is determined by the follow-
ing expressions [39]:

arising in them under the influence of two
factors: the force Q applied in the ro-
tor's center of mass along its axis of ro-
tation and the bending moment “i directed
along the rotor's 0? axis (Figure 16).

From expressions (2.132)—(2.l34) it follows that the higher the rotor's angular ve-
Locity, the smaller the stresses in the torsion bars. The maximum stresses do not
iecerc on the length of the torsion bars. Therefore, from the viewpoint of strength
;: is more favorable to have short and thick torsion bars. In the case of a cruci-
:::n cross- section, the larger the value of ratio h/p that can be provided, the
smaller the stresses. From the viewpoint of achieving maximum strength, cruciform
torsion bars are the most preferable of the three types under discussion. If the

Cy and C2 are. In this case the instrument's errors and dynamics should be defined
more precisely according to the equations that describe the functioning of an CH6

CHAPTER 3. COMPOSITE ROTOR VIBRATION GYROSCOPES
3.1. Principles of the Construction of Composite Rotor Vibration Gyroscopes

An analysis of the functioning of various va systems shows that when the rotor's
center of mass is displaced relative to the suspension axes' point of intersection,
most of them react to linear accelerations of the base in the same manner as they do
to its linear velocities. This leads to errors in the readings that can be reduced
only by careful static balancing. At the same time. in the case of segregation of
signal components caused by the base's angular velocities and its linear accelera-
tion, this property makes it possible to create an.instrument that measures simulta-
neously both the absolute angular velocities and the linear accelerations of the
base's motion. we will call such instruments composite va's. The principles of
the construction of these avc's are explained in [43].

Zn order to segregate signal components, it is necessary to know the characteristic
features of each of them. It is obvious that these components can be segregated
neither by a frequency nor by a phase feature. The feature used can be only the
sign of the component. The signal component that is proportional to the angular ve-
locities changes sign when the direction of the drive motor's angular velocity ”0
does, while the component that is proportional to the linear accelerations changes
sign when the sign of coordinate ax of the displacement of the rotor's center of
mass does .

When constructing a composite va it is necessary to have two signals. in one of
which only one component differs in sign from the one analogous to it in the other.
The other signal parameters must be identical. From this it follows that in order
to construct a composite RVG it is necess’ry to have two identical oscillatory sys-
tems that differ from each other either in the drive motor's direction of rotation
:r oy the sign of the coordinate of the dispiacement of the rotor's center of mass
rthtive to the suspension axes' point of intersection.

in the first case we must have two independent avc's with parameter values that are
extremely close to each other. It should be mentioned here that the creation of a
:cmposite instrument according to such a principle is also possible through the use
of classical two- and three-stage gyroscopes, although the preservation with the re-
:éited degree of accuracy of the identity of the parameters in these instruments,
which are usually of a complicated, prefabricated type, is practically unrealizable.

In the second case, both oscillatory systems can be mounted on the shaft of a single
drive motor. Such a method of instrument construction is most rational. since it

o

makes it possible to reduce the instrument‘s dimensions substantially and does not
require (as it does in the first case) synchronization of the angular velocities
(when different drive motors are used) or the use of reversing (when a single drive
motor is used).

A composite RVG can be built on the basis
of the different RVG layouts described in
the preceding chapters. However, taking
into consideration the requirement for the
greatest possible overall identity of the
oscillatory systems' parameters, preference
should be given to the structurally most
simply realizable GIG setup.

Figure 18 is a diagram of a composite in-
strument (KONG) based on two 086's. To the
shaft of a drive motor rotating with angu-
lar velocity “0' two rotors are attached,
each by its own pair of torsion bars. The
rotors' suspension (measuring) axes are
situated parallel to each other in a single
plane. The rotors' centers of mass are
displaced, relative to their suspension ax-
is, along axis of rotation ox by the values

 

3x1 and 3x2.
Figure 18. Diagram of composite RVG
with independent suspension of the As was demonstrated in [43], it is also
rotors. possible for the torsion bars' axes to be

placed perpendicular to each other. How-
ever, although in the first case angular vibrations of the PD's shaft with frequency
Zuo, which give rise to errors in the measurement of absolute angular velocities,
haVe practically no effect on the accuracy of the measurement of linear accelera-
tions, in the second case the opposite is true: their effect on the accuracy of the
measurement of absolute angular velocities is insignificant, but during the measure-
ment of linear accelerations it is very tangible. Thus, the advantage can be given
to either system, depending on the formulation of the problem. There are no other
differences in systems with parallel and perpendicular positioning of the torsion
bars, so let us discuss the former.

From (2.92) it follows that, in the first approximation, the rotors' equations of
motion relative to the measuring axes have the form

In equations (3.1). subscript "1" refers to the first rotor (31). and ”2" to the
second rotor (32).

Let us discuss the case where the values of the parameters of both oscillatory sys-
tems equal each other, while the rotors' centers of mass are displaced to different
sides at equal distances from the suspension axis (ax; - -ax1). By subtracting and
adding, term—by-tarm. the equations in system (3.1). we obtain

Thus, the rotors' total angle of rotation relative to their measuring axes will be
proportional to the base's angular velocity in the instrument's plane of sensitivi-
ty. while the difference between the rotors' angles of rotation is proportional to
the base's linear accelerations in the same plane.

The information can be extracted by three different methods. ?irst, by summing and
subtracting the appropriate signals at the demodulators' outlets. In this case each
GHG has its own signal reading and processing system. Secondly, by summing and sub-
tracting the amplitude-modulated signals at the outputs of the sensors of the ro-
tors' angles of rotation. Here, each one has its own rotor rotation angle sensor,

while further processing of the information takes place individually, over an angu-
lar velocity measurement channel and a linear acceleration measurement channel.
Finally, in the third case signal separation by channels is possible by using angle
measurers. one of which measures the rotors' total angle of rotation “C directly,
while the other measures the difference angle a“. It is obvious that such measurers
can be constructed on the basic of well-known inductance and capacitance angle meas-
urers. of the three signal separation methods listed, the last is the most prefera-
ble, since it eliminates completely the effect of nonidentity of the parameters of
the different information reading and processing system.channels on cross communica-
tions between the angular velocity and linear acceleration measurement channels.

From (3.2) it follows that the functioning of a KONG with respect to the angular ve-
locity measurement channel is practically the same as that of the 0M6. the features
of which were described in Chapter 2, except for the fact that its transfer factor

is doubled.

Let us evaluate how the instrument's basic parameters are related to the character-
istics of the linear acceleration measurement channel. It is not difficult to see
that motion of the base in the instrument's plane of sensitivity 20!, with constant
Linea: accelerations T, leads to a signal at the KCMG's output that is equivalent to
the signal that appears when the base rotates at a constant angular velocity 6;, as
determined by the expression

ty thresholds. as well as the sensitivities

gical capabilities for creating such a
small displacement of the rotor's center of
mass and maintaining it during the operat-
ing process. All other conditions being
equal. this limit can be lowered by in-
creasing the rotor's frequency of rotation

From an analysis of expression (3.4) it is possible to assume that however low a
threshold of instrument sensitivity to linear acceleration is desired can be
achieved by increasing the displacement ax of the rotor's center of mass. However,
this is not so. Analyzing equations of motion (2.92), we find that for quite large
values of ax we should take into consideration moment

parison with the equation's basic terms. Linear vibrations of the base relative to
the ox axis can lead to parametric resonance and the disruption of the instrument's
stable operation, while constant linear accelerations can result in detuning from

the resonance mode. In accordance with expression (2.122). the relative detuning
can be computed with the formula

From (3.5) it is possible to determine the maximum allowable value of ax as a func-

tion of the instrument parameters, the linear accelerations acting on it, and the
requirements for its accuracy characteristics.

The creation in a KONG of the required ranges for measuring angular velocities and
linear accelerations is an important question. The design of the torsion bars and
the rotor rotation angle measurer is such that angle w is limited by some maximum

value vuax. since the amplitude of the rotor's angle of rotation is determined si-
multaneously by both the velocity and the linear acceleration being measured, their

ranges depend on each other. When only small angular velocities are being measured.
the range of the linear accelerations is enlarged, and vice versa.

Let us discuss how to evaluate an instrument's maximum range for linear accelera-
tions and angular velocities. when resonance tuning condition (1.68) is fulfilled,

from equations (3.2) we find that the maximum angle of rotation of the rotor is de-
termined by the expression

¢+¢=

From (3.7) it follows that for a highly
sensitive instrument, even when the meas-
urement range for angular velocity is ex-
tremely limited (when the instrument is
mounted on a stabilized base) its linear
acceleration measurement range is still
103-105, which is inadequate for many prob-
lems. We should also mention here that the
measurement range is coupled with the in-
strument's pass band and increases as it is
expanded.

The KONG system under discussion contains
two independent oscillatory systems. Since
it is impossible to achieve complete iden-

      

->/ tity of these systems' parameters during
E.."ln\ /_ —" 3 \ the production process, instrument tuning
"\I' 2" consists of achieving equality of the fre-

tor's shaft. Individual parameters of the
oscillatory systems, such as the rotor's moments of inertia and the torsion bars'
:igidity, can differ noticeably from each other. A change in these parameters dur-
.:; the operating process leads to different relative detuning of the systems from
resonance and, as will be shown below, to substantial instrument errors.

From (3.7) it follows that a substantial enlargement of the range of linear acceler-
ations that can be measured is impossible without reducing the instrument's sensi-
tivity to angular velocity, and vice versa. The KCMG layout depicted in Figure 20
was proposed for the purpose of eliminating this defect. In this setup both rotors
have a common suspension axis 02. In the general case, the angular rigidity of'the
torsion bar connecting rotor Rl to the shaft equals C1, that of the torsion bar con-
necting rotor R2 to the shaft is C2, and that of the intermediate torsion bar con-
necting the two rotors is Ci. As in the preceding case, the rotors' centers of mass
are displaced along the ox axis relative to the oz axis by distances ‘Xl and ax; (in
connection with this, it is necessary to try to insure that ax1 - -ax2 - ax). In
comparison with the layout discussed earlier, this one makes it possible to achieve
a significant reduction in the instrument's size and is more convenient from the
viewpoint of the manufacturing process. since both rotors and the torsion bars can

he made from a single blank. Besides this, any errors related to nonparallelism of
both rotors' measuring axes are eliminated.

The equations of motion of a KONG realized according to the layout depicted in Fig-
ure 20 have the form

If the parameters of both rotors are identical, then-~by adding and subtracting

equations (3.8) on a term-by-tern basis--we obtain the following KCMG equations of
motion:

Thus, as with the preceding setup, the rotors' total angle of rotation °C is propor-
tional to the base‘s angular velocity in the plane of sensitivity, while difference
angle a, is proportional to the linear accelerations in the same plane. The essen-
tial difference between the second KCMG construction plan and the first is that in
the second one. resonance tuning with respect to the angular velocity and linear ac-
celeration measurement channels cannot be realized simultaneously. when one of the
channels is tuned into resonance, the second will have the relative detuning

By varying the value of 2,, this makes it possible to change the relationship

between the instrument's sensitivity thresholds for angular velocity and linear ac-
celeration. Actually, if (for example) resonance tuning is carried out with respect
to the angular velocity measurement channel, the relationship between the equivalent

angular velocity and the linear acceleration has the form (allowing for expression
(3.10))

is (that is, the higher the instrument's sensitivity), the more significant this re-
duction is.

3.2. Dynamic Characteristics and Basic Errors in Composite Rotor Vibration Gyro-
scopes

Let us discuss in more detail the operation of a KONG setup (see Figure 18) contain-
ing two independent oscillatory systems, as described by equations (3.1). From
(3.2) it follows that when the parameters of both oscillatory systems are identical
and the measuring axes are parallel, the instrument consists. as it were, of two in-
dependent channels for measuring angular velocity and linear acceleration, each of
which--in turn--also contains two channels corresponding to the instrument's axes of
sensitivity. The dynamic characteristics 0: the angu.ar velocity measurement chan-
nel are described by transfer function 39 (p), as determined by expression (1.81),

while the linear acceleration measurement channel is described by the transfer func-

.nus, both: hannels have the same pass band, in which the frequency distortions are

quite small. From (1.86) it follows that the narrower this band is, the higher the
instrument' 3 sensitivity.

WW!)-

There exist a number of technical problems in which, along with a highly sensitive
measurer of angular velocities, a less accurate but broad-band measurer of linear
accelerations is required. Within the framework of the setup we are discussing,
such an instrument can be realized only by the creation of zero displacement of the
center of mass of one of the oscillatory systems, which will operate as a normal
0M6. 1d the creation of the required dynamic characteristics in the second oscilla-
tcrgl system, which has a displaced center of mass. In connection with this, in or-
:er to obtain a signal that is proportional to the linear accelerations, after pre-
- :.nary processing (for the purpose of obtaining identical characteristics with re-
sect to the angular velocity) the signal iron the first oscillatory system should
be subtracted from the signal trom the second. In this trivial way it is possible
to achieve full independence of the angular velocity measuring channel from linear
accelerations of the base.

Figure 21 is the structural diagram of a KCMG constructed according to the setup
sncwn in Figure 18 and in accordance with equations (3.1). The characteristic fea-
ture of this setup is the presence in it of cross-couplings between the measuring
::Jnneis when the oscillatory systems' parameters are not identical. Let us evalu-
Ate the level and nature of these couplings. Allowing for the presence at the in-
strument's outlet of a phase-sensitive demodulator, we will consider only signals

From expression: (3.12) and (3.13) it follows that the cross-couplings are the
greatest in a highly sensitive instrument that is operating in a resonance tuning
mode. The relationships I.: l, i << 1 usually occur for such instruments. Taking
into consideration the relationships between instrument parameters that occur during
operation in the resonance tuning mode, and using expressions (3.12)-(3.16), in ac-
cordance with the structural diagram depicted in Figure 22 we obtain the following
expressions for the equivalent linear acceleration IjeI and angular velocity we:

nel's output: 5e I angular velocity of the base, the signal from which is identical
to the signal from the base's linear accelerations j at the angular velocity meas-
urement channel's output.

From expression (3.17) and (3.18) it follows that the greatest effect on the level
of the cross-couplings is exerted by nonidentity of the oscillatory systems with re-
spect to parameter it This is explained by the fact that determines the value of
the dynamic rigidity along the rotors' suspension axis. which is 98-99 percent of
the total rigidity along this axis. When 5 << 1, even an insignificant change in
will move the system out of the resonance tuning mode and cause a sharp change in
its transfer factor and the signals' phase relationships. For example. given iden-
tical sensitivity of the instrument '5 measuring channels and £<10'3, in order to
obtain a cross-coupling level of u e/j I je/ﬁ 5 10' 2, it is necessary to achieve
identity of the oscillatory systems' with respect to parameter a with better than
0.004-percent accuracy. An instrument constructed according to this plan can oper-
ate only in a narrow band of measurable values. In order to enlarge the measurement
band, a plan in which one of the oscillatory systems has zero displacement of the

center of mass (for example, an a 0) can be used. In this case the instrument's
transfer functions have the form

Here there is no dependence of the angular velocity measurement channel on the ac-

celeration measurement channel, while the effect of the first on the second can be
reduced by creating the appropriate relationship between the instrument's channels'
sensitivities.

The effect on the cross-couplings' level of nonidentity of the torsion bars' tor-
sional rigidities c is directly proportional to the share of these rigidities in the
system's total rigidity along the suspension axis; that is. the smaller the value of
l - a. the less the effect. Practically, for identical conditions the requirements
for accuracy in maintaining C are two orders of magnitude smaller than the analogous
requirements for parameter x. The requirements for the identity of the coefficients
of viscous friction in both oscillatory systems are smaller by a factor of 1/: than

the requirements for u and are comparatively easily realizable for small values of
r

go

There is yet one more factor that can lead to cross-couplings between the measuring
channels in this setup: nonparallelism of the rotors' suspension axes. Actually.
between the projections of the rotors' suspension axes on a plane perpendicular to
the axis of rotatin. let there exist a small angle AX. If the first OMG's transfer
factor then equals unity, the second's will equal e1 9. The inequality of the
transfer factors results in cross-couplings between the measuring channels. In con-

nection with this it is obvious that j, and a; can be determined with the help of
the following expressions:

Analogous cross-couplings will occur when the suspension axes are not parallel in
the XOY plane. In comparison with the others. the leqel of these couplings is in-

significant and can be limited by introducing the appropriate tolerances in the in-
strumsnt production and assembly process.

Let us discuss the cross-couplings between the measuring channels that occur during
the operation of a KONG built according to the second plan. By adding and subtract-
ing equations (3.8)tm1a term-by-term basis. we obtain equations that describe this

From expressions (3.25) and (3.26) it follows that, as was the case for the first
setup. the greatest influence on the level of the cross-couplings between the meas-
uring channels is exerted by the nonidentical natural of the rotors with respect to
parameter R. In contrast to the first setup, however. the level of the cross-
couplings depends on which of the measuring channels is used to realize resonance
tuning. If resonance tuning takes place along the angular velocity measurement

channel, the cross-coupling from the first channel to the second has a high level,
and vice versa. The level of the cross-coupling from the channel not having reso-
nance tuning to the other is determined by the magnitude of this channel's detuning
from resonance, which is regulated by the intermediate torsion bar's rigidity C1.
Thus, by selecting the appropriate value of C1, it is possible to change the chan-

nels' dynamic characteristics, their measurement range and the level of the cross-
couplings.

From the expressions for the transfer functions of an 0H6 (1.86) and a KONG it fol-
lows that during the creation of a highly sensitive instrument (when resonance tun-
ing is realized and the relative damping factor 5 is extremely small), its time con-
stant Tg can be quite large. As a result of this, in a KONG there can arise large
errors in the determination of angular velocities and linear accelerations. These
errors are especially large when the instrument is operating in an open system (for
example, the acceleration measurement channel's dynamic errors for an inertial navi-
gation syStem and so on). Taking (1.81) into consideration, the expression for the
acceleration measurement channel's dynamic error can be written. with a sufficient
degree of accuracy, in the form

:hus. the larger the value of T9, the greater the instrument's dynamic error. At
the same time. as was shown in Section 1.6, the higher the instrument's sensitivity
(the smaller 5 is). the greater the value of Tg. Therefore. the realization of an

instrument that has both high sensitivity and small dynamic errors is fundamentally
impossible within the :ramework or the layout we are discussing.

In addition to the specific errors we have discussed, a KOHG also has all the errors
that are typical of an CH5 (see Section 2.4). In this case the errors related to
ingular motion of the instrument's base and synchronous interference are doubled in
the velocity measurement channel. In the acceleration measurement channel they are
ietarmined by the nonidentity o: the oscillatory systems' parameters. Thus. the
Linear acceleration measurement channel's errors are much smaller than those of the
angular acceleration measurement channel. Thanks to this, the instrument's second
channel's sensitivity threshold is lower and the cross-couplings from the second
channel to the first can be reduced. The second channel's dynamic errors can be re-
duced by introducing detuning from the resonance mode.

2.3. Synthesizing the Parameters of an Output Filter for Composite Rotor Vibration
Gyroscope:

:n section 3.2 it was shown that composite MRG's have significant dynamic errors
that cannot be reduced without lowering the instrument's sensitivity. These errors
have the greatest etfect on the instrument's functioning in the linear acceleration
measurement channel if the signals from the channel are used for an inertial naviga-
titn system. Integration of these signals results in inadmissibly large errors in
determining velocity and the path that has been covered. Into the channel's input
there also enter disturbances related to angular and linear oscillations of the

106

base, which are a source of additional errors. Besides this, both the instrument
itself and the signal extraction and processing devices have internal noise, on
which the instrument's sensitivity threshold depends to a considerable extent.

Thus, there arises the problem of optimum signal processing at the linear accelera-
tion measurement channel's outlet for the purpose of obtaining the most reliable in-
formation about the linear accelerations acting on the object, with due considera-
tion for the factors listed above. Such processing can be carried out with the help
of a special filter installed at the instrument's output. Let us determine the pa-
rameters of this filter.

 

Figure 24. Diagram of formation of composite RVG errors.

Figure 24 is a structural diagram of the formation of instrument errors in the ac-
celeration measurement channel. Let us introduce the following definitions:

f3(t) = the disturbance caused by angular and linear oscillations of the base, re-
duced to an equivalent linear acceleration; fn(t) = the instrument's internal
noises, as heard at its outlet; 3(9) - transfer function of the filter at the in-
strument's outlet. Disturbance f,(t) is of a random nature and depends on the char-
acteristics of the specific object in which the instrument is installed, as well as
the conditions of its motion. Therefore, we will ignore this disturbance in our
further discussion. An instrument's internal noises are also of a random nature and
are usually approximated by "white noise." We will alsoassumefn(t) to be "white
noise" with the same power 32 at both channel outputs.

we will determine transfer function 6(p) on the basis of the minimum mean-square er-
ror in the measurement of the linear acceleration's absolute value and the given
limitation on the dispersion of the noise at the instrument's outlet. This means
that it is necessary to bring to a minimum the functional

1.. j|ad(l)[‘dl+k’0¢(l). (3.33)

where k - an indeterminate Lagrange multiplier; D5(t) - dispersion of the modulus of
the linear acceleration measurement channel's output signal.

An instrument has the greatest dynamic errors when operating in the resonance tuning
mode. :n connection with this, the cross-couplings between the channels can be ig-
nored with a sufficient degree of accuracy, while the instrument's transfer function
is written in the form of (1.86). In this case the problem reduces to the synthesis
of a filter that is optimum, in the sense of criterion (3.33), for each linear ac-
celeration measurement channel. We will use the method of synthesis in a frequency
area, the basic ideas of which are explained in (411. According to (Parseval"s)
theorem, in the area of images the expression for functional (3.33) can be written--
allowing for the assumptions we have made--in the following form:

Let us adopt a law governing the change in acceleration in the form of (3.28). When
determining 00(9) we will require that the optimum filter be stable: that is, that
all poles of 00(9) lie in the left semiplane. Substituting (3.29) and (1.86) into
(3.36). we will write the multiplier standing in front of 00(9) as:

Thus, when the law governing the change in linear acceleration and the instrument's
parameters are known. expression (3.43) makes it possible to reduce the instrument's
dynamic error by realizing optimum (under the indicated conditions) filtration of

the output signal. For example, if the linear acceleration at the instrument's in-

put changes rapidly (j - so), the expression for the optimum filter's transfer func-

The realization of such a filter presents no significant difficulties. Filtration

effectiveness and feasibility can be determined for any specific problem. In order
to do this, after the parameters of the filter are computed, it is necessary to re-
evaluate the instrument's dynamic errors. It should be mentioned here that a syn-

thesized filter is optimal only for specific disturbances and instrument parameters.
for which their mathematical expectations can be used. For a conclusive evaluation
of the effectiveness of filtration, the sensitivity function for changing disturban-

ces and instrument parameters should be derived and the additional dynamic errors
appearing in connection with these disturbances should be evaluated.

CHAPTER 4. STABILIZATION SYSTEMS UTILIZING ROTOR VIBRATIONS GYROSCOPES AS THE BASIC
SENSITIVE ELEMENTS

4.1. Stabilization System Equations of Motion, Structural Diagrams and Transfer
Functions

The specific nature of va's, which are small, highly sensitive measurers of abso-
lute angular velocities, determines their basic area of utilization as sensitive el-
ements in the construction of systems that are stabilized in inertial space. These
systems are installed in ships for the purpose of creating a reference system of co-
ordinates and are usually built to operate with gyroscopic sensors of different

I CYPes. There are two fundamentally different ways of using evo's in stabilization
systems.

The first way involves the use of RVG's as the basic sensors that measure the devia-
tion of a stabilized platform from the position it initially occupied in inertial
space and generate and send an appropriate signal to the system that controls the
stabilizing engines, which must compensate for the effect of the disturbing moments.
This way provides for the creation of relatively more accurate and cheaper stabil-
ized platforms than platforms based on gyroscopes of the classical type [15). The
use of RVG‘s makes it possible to miniaturize platforms, which for many objects is
extremely important. In this case, a number of demands are made on an va acting as
a sensor for a stabilization system. In addition to a low sensitivity threshold, it

must have rather broad ranges of measurable velocities and frequencies, as well as
high accuracy when operating on a base subjected to a broad spectrum of disturbances.

The second way involves the use of va's to increase the accuracy of gyroscopically
stabilized platforms (GSP) by integration with traditional two-stage gyroscopic sen-
sors.

The simplest stabilization systems that can be built using RVG's are unaxial stabil-
ized platforms (05?). In this case one of the RVG's sensitivity axes coincides with
the axis of stabilization. As a result, at the output of the instrument's appropri-

ate channel there forms a signal that is proportional to the platform's angular ve-
locity of rotation around the axis of stabilization in inertial space. The absolute

angular velocity of rotation of the platform around an unstabilized axis that coin-
cides with the avc's second axis of sensitivity, leads to the appearance at the

RVG's output of an error signal because of the cross-coupling that takes place in
the PVC itself.

A structural diagram of an OS? is shown in a linear and stationary approximation in
Figure 25. The following definitions are used in the system: as - disturbing

spectively; "k.k(P) I transfer function of the correcting circuit in the stabilizing
circuit; wp(p) - transfer function of the stabilizing engine.

An analysis of the system represented by the structural diagram in Figure 25 makes
it possible to study its basic properties (in the first approximation) and realize a
preliminary synthesis of the regulator's parameters. For a more detailed investiga-
tion of OSP's based on RVG's, their specific features should be taken into consider-
ation. As was shown in chapter 1, the signal of a modulation RVG (an HRS) contains
two companents: a slowly changing one (the signal on the zero frequency) and an
amplitude-modulated one that has a carrier frequency equal to the doubled frequency
of rotation of the rotor. For structural considerations the latter component cannot
be overly high and is usually 200-400 Hz. This component must be filtered reliably,
for otherwise it can cause an undesirable angular vibration of the platform on fre-
quency ZmO. It is obvious that for large amplification factors, the filter for the
doubled frequency of rotation can have noticeable effect on the system's dynamics.
Therefore. the OSP's basic characteristics should be defined precisely, allowing for
the nonstationary nature of the RVG's signal.

The structural diagram of such a system, allowing for the RVG transfer functions de-
rived in chapter 1, has the form shown in Figure 26. For an HRS there is only one
nonstationary parallel conneccion between the instrument's input and output, which
in the diagram is reflected by the presence of multiplying elements that modulate
the signal on frequency Zoo. For RVG's with double modulation and single modulation
by motor PDl, for which condition (1.22) is not fulfilled. there will be (generally
speaking) an infinite set of such parallel connections. In connection with this,
modulation frequencies n will be both multiples of frequency Zoo and composites of
frequencies ”0 and 01. The cross-couplings from the instrument's second measuring
channel will also contain a full set of amplitude-modulated signals, which in the
structural diagram are shown by the signals Hal....,uﬂn at the va's output. The
errors caused by disturbing moments with the appropriate modulation frequencies are
allowed for in the form of equivalent angular velocities “e-

Figure 26. Structural diagram of 06?, allowing for the non-
stationary nature of the RVG.

Real OSP's based on RVG's are not linear systems, so when determining their proper-
ties we should allow for the effect on their operation of the basic nonlinearities.
Above all, this means nonlinearity of the type of saturation in the measurer of the
RVG's rotor's angle of rotation. It is caused by the presence of arresting devices
that limit the rotor's angle of rotation and protect the torsion bars against frac-
turing. as well as the limitation on the range of the change in voltage in each in-
dividual channel of the signal processing system. The second essential nonlinearity
is the moment of dry friction in the platform's suspension axis. It can be particu-
larly large when a direct-current moment sensor with a brush commutator is used as
the stabilizing engine. When saturation in each channel of the signal processing
system and the moments of dry friction are allowed for, the structural diagram of an
05? with an RVG takes on the form depicted in Figure 27.

The analytical expression for nonlinearity of the saturation type in the signal pro-
cessing system's channel can be approximated with a piecewise-linear function 0: the

"Dry" friction is usually approximated by so-called Coulomb friction [22], which--
depending on the platform's and base's relative angular velocity--is described by a

A problem of particular complexity is allowing for the presence of arresting devices
that limit the angles of rotation of the RVG rotors. Limitation of the rotors' de-
grees of freedom leads to a change in the equations of motion, which become essen-

tially nonlinear, so that the MRS transfer functions derived in Chapter I lose their
meaning.

Taking into consideration the nonstationary nature of the WC and the described non-

linearities that are inherent in OSP's and RVG's, we are now able to investigate an
OSP's basic properties.

Let us examine the special features of the description of multiaxial stabilized
platforms. Figure 28 is a diagram of a triaxial stabilized platform (TSP). Either
two or three RVG's can be used in its construction. In view of the fact that each
we is a two-dimensional measurer. the first variant makes it possible to achieve
duplication of one channel. while the second makes it possible to duplicated all
three stabilization channels. The most natural orientation of the RVG's on the

platform is the one in which their axes of sensitivity coincide with the stabiliza-
tion axes.

In order to describe such a system. we will use a vector-matrix apparatus. In this
case. given assmptions that enable us to regard the system as being stationary and

In the structural diagram we have introduced the vectors of the system's generalized
coordinates and the disturbances acting on it, as well as the transfer matrices of
its basic elements. When constructing the platform's transfer matrix "11(p) , along
with the cross-couplings between the channels with respect to the platform's cen-
trifugal moments of inertia [221, the cross-couplings with respect to the gyroscopic
moments should also be taken into consideration. The latter arise because of the
fact that the rotating parts of each RVG, which are rotor P02, have some kinetic mo-
ment hi- Allowing for this, the elements ‘ij of the platform's transfer matrix are

The measurers' transfer matrix Wg(p) allows for the operation of each of the three

Matrix Wk.k(p) can be an arbitrary operator matrix with 3 x 3 dimensionality. Its
elements must be selected in such a manner that for a given unchanging part of the
system. desirable dynamic characteristics are obtained in it. In particular, when
the cross-couplings are week, this matrix can be a diagonal one.

Natrix BWp(p) allows for the transfer functions Npi(p) of the regulators in each of
the channels. as well as the cross-couplings between the stabilization channels with

respect to the stabilizing engines' moments [22]. In the general case this matrix-

?he cross-couplings in the regulator are eliminated almost completely when a device

that realizes spatial conversion of the coordinates is used [24]. Plane conversion

of the coordinates eliminates cross-couplings caused by the platform's angle of ro-

tation 31 alone. It should be mentioned here that in some cases the structural fea-
tures of an avc make it possible to simplify substantially the solution of the prob-

unidimensional case, for systems with single modulation by the P02 motor and systems
with modulation by the P01 motor, for which condition (1.22) is fulfilled, in this
system there is only a single nonstationarY: parallel coupling with modulation on
frequency Zmo. For other RVG setups there is an infinite set of such couplings with
modulating frequencies that are both multiples of zoo and composite frequencies.
Transfer matrices Wg(p), “9(9) and W9.k(p) are diagonal matrices, along the main di-
agonals of which the corresponding complex RVG transfer functions are located.

Let us discuss a method of representing, with the help of a matrix structural dia-
gram, a TS? in whith the basic nonlinearities of the type of saturation in the RVC
(4.1) and the type of dry friction in the suspension axas (4.2) are taken into con-
sideration. In order to do this. we will introduce so-called nonlinearity units 381
and 8&2, which are diagonal matrices of dimensionality 3 x 3 in which the piecewise-
linear functions “hi and “Ti' as determined by expressions (4.1) and (4.2), are lo-
cated along the respective main diagonals. The input for BH2 should be the vector
of the platform's relative angular velocities in the suspension axes. When the base
is immobile, the conversion from the absolute angular velocities of the platform to
its relative velocities in the suspension axes is accomplished by multiplication
from the left of matrix ET by vector &, [22]. When the system of coordinates is
given as indicated in [24], the relationship between the vector of relative veloci-
ties in the suspension axes and the base's angular velocities is determined by ma-

regarded as being reduced to the platform's suspension axes. With the help of ma-
trix B, the total moment is converted to the moment acting along the platform‘s ax-

4.2. Static Characteristics of Stabilization Systems

Let us discuss the simplest OS? layout. From the structural diagram depicted in
Figure 25 it is easy to derive the transfer function of an open system:

Wm) = «,1- 73'7; W,(p)W...(p) mm. (4.9)

where T, - Jtlul. The transfer function of a closed system, with respect to a dis-

while with respect to the equivalent angular velocity acting at the Eva's output, it
is

 

V I
K"(p) = I .- 31” T' (4.11)
In expressions (4.10) and (4.11) let us make the maximum transition for p e 0. In
the absence in the stabilization circuit of purely differentiating or integrating
components, for p + 0 the maximum of the product wk k(p)Hp(p) is hp.

As has already been stated, in connection with dynamic tuning an RVG can be charac-
terized by two operating modes. The first of them is the integrating mode, which
occurs in the initial period of the.transient process in connection with the effect
on the instrument's input of a discontinuity in the angular velocity. Since the
length of the transient process is quite long for highly sensitive va's, for a 65?
this mode will be caused by the effect of the disturbance resulting from some static
error appearing after the conclusion of the short-period component of the transient
process in the stabilization system. The second mode is a differentiating one and
is the RVG's steady-state reaction to a constant angular velocity. In this mode the
instrument's properties will determine the GSP's drifts when acted upon by constant
disturbing moments along the stabilization axes.

In the first case, with respect to the base's absolute angular velocity the follow-
ing relationship occurs:

Wr(p)Z—KY (4.12)
and in the second:

When the RVG is operating in the differentiating mode and the requirements for OSP
accuracy are real, it is necessary that amplification factor xp be one or two orders
of magnitude greater than when the RVG is operating in the integrating mode. In the
case of large values of KP, OS? drifts are determined by RVG errors expressed in
terms of the equivalent angular velocities at its input.

Let us discuss the static characteristics of multidimensional stabilization systems.
When a system is represented in linear and stationary form, in accordance with the
structural diagram depicted in Pigure 29, its equation of motion has the form

form, in the system it is possible to realize mixed control of the stabilizing en-

gines; that is, all the elements of matrix wk,k(p) do not equal zero. It is then
the case that, in the differentiating mode.

the correcting circuit: ng = "9"(0)/W9.°(0) . relative transfer factor of cross-
signals in the RVG.

Let us make some simplifications in expressions (4.19). As was shown in Section
1.6, the RVG's transfer factor with respect to the cross-signal relative to the
base's angular velocity is determined by the detuning of the instrument from the
resonance mode or by a phase shift in the demodulator. In real instruments these
values should be quite small, so in (4.19) we can ignore the terms containing K14
The transfer factor of an open, isolated stabilization channel is usually greater
than unity, so the following relationship is fulfilled:

Considering what has been said, let us derive the expression for a DSP's static er-
rors in a simpler form:

From (4.20) it follow that a DSP's static errors can be reduced by increasing the
amplification factor in the circuit for the direct control of the stabilizing en-
gines and in the cross-control circuit, as well as by increasing the kinetic mount
h. In connection with direct control, it is sufficient to set K23 - K32 - o in ex-
pression (4. 29). 'In the case of cross-control alone, expression (4.20) is trans-
formed into

Given the assumptions made above, disturbances applied to the system in the form of

From (4.22) follows the trivial conclusion that the larger kinetic moment h is rela-

tive to the stabilization circuits' amplification factors, the smaller the systemat-
ic DSP drifts caused by RVG errors. For small kinetic moments and high amplifica-
tion factors in the stabilization circuit:

that is, for all practical purposes the DSP drifts equal the RVG errors.

In an analogous manner let us determine the DSP's static errors when the RVG is op-
erating in the integrating mode. When a disturbing moment is acting along the
:tabilization.axes, they can be defined as

Thus, when the RVG is operating in the integrating mode, constant disturbing moments
result in permanent angular deviations of the OS? from the position it initially oc-
cupied in inertial space, it being the case that the higher the open system's ampli-
fication factor, the smaller the deviations are. In connection with this, both di-
rect and cross control prove to be effective.

4.3. choosing the Structure and Parameters of a Uniaxial Stabilization System

Let us discuss OSP's that are described by the structural diagram presented in Fig-
ure ZS. We will choose the structure and parameters of the correcting circuit on
the basis of the requirement of realizing a given value of KP in the system while

insuring its stable operation with given indicators for the quality of the transient
processes.

Let us examine an 05? based on a single-rotor MRS featuring signal reading in a ro-
tating system of coordinates. In the dynamic tuning made. its transfer function
with respect to the basic signal is described by expression (1.86). As the indica-
tor of the transient process's quality-we will take the value of the cutoff frequen-
cy w: of the open system's LAKh [logarithmic frequency response characteristic] and
its deviation in the area of this frequency, as well as the system's stability re-
serves with respect to phase 93 and amplitude A3 [2]. From an examination of the
open system's frequency characteristics it follows directly that it is easy to ob-
tain the given values of the quality indicators by using a series-connected correct-
ing circuit with the following transfer function:

r094" I.

WNW) “ m~

Tu > T.;- (4.26)
Let us establish the relationship between the values of the time constants Tkl and
Tkz' the regulator's amplification factor KP, cutoff frequency w; and the values of
the stability reserves relative to amplitude and phase when the LAKh's deviation in
the area of the cutoff frequency is -20 dB/decade.

Considering the fact that for real systems the time constants ‘1‘ﬂ - July, and T9 are
large and that the frequencies corresponding to them are considerably lower than the
cutoff frequency, we obtain the following systems of equations:

Kﬁ, [Tilu‘4-l l | 1.4'

where ”l - the frequency on which the cpen system's phase characteristic equals -3;
T9 - a time constant that allows for the stabilizing engine's inertial lag.

We will assume that the condition l/‘rp >> w; is fulfilled in the system. It is then
obvious that the maximum ratio Tklekl - v for which the required stability reserve
with respect to phase is insured is determined by the expression

val+2lg’tp,—l'(T—T—;- lg_’vp,)’——l. (4.29)

while the cutoff frequency is

mined by expression (4.15). "hen acted upon by real disturbances, however, the

124
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

drifts in such systems (as found with expression (4.14)) can become quite large.
Reducing the drifts by one or two orders of magnitude causes a significant enlarge-
ment of the system's pass band. As a result, the requirements for the stabilization
system elements that are related to the expansion of their dynamic range are raised
and the noise level in each of the elements is reduced. Thus, the stabilization
circuit structure under discussion can be used as a basis for correcting systems or

systems in which the requirements for the magnitude of the drift are not quite so
high.

The easiest way to increase an open system's amplification factor is to include an
integrating-d1fferentiating element in the stabilization circuit. The correcting
circuit's transfer function then acquires the form

.. 7w+l T.n+l
“'.-..(P)=7:—mTj,,—ﬁ~ (4.34)

where Tk4 > Tk3 >> Th1 2 Tkz' In connection with this it can be assumed that the
amplification factor increases by a factor of TkJ/Tk4 while the open system's LAKh's
cutoff frequency remains unchanged. The required value of the open system‘s ampli-
fication factor also determines the relationship between the time constants TR; and
Th4. Time constant Tk3 should be selecced in such a fashion that relationship

Th3 >> Tkl is satisfied. In this case the technique for selecting time constants
Tkl and Th2 and allowing for the effect of the stabilizing engine's time constant T9
is analogous to the one described above. Let us mention, however, that the given
system will have two stability reserves with respect to amplitude; that is, it is
provisionally stable.

As follows from an analysis of the equations of motion, the dynamic characteristics
of a 3M6 differ substantially from the characteristics of an CMG. Let us discuss an
06? based on the use of one of the most highly developed types of RVG: a DMG with
single modulation by motor P02 and Signal reading in a nonrotating system of coord-
inates on the zero frequency {a Khaui gyroscope). We will make use of its transfer
functions. as approximated in the band of essential frequencies by expressions
(1.109). An oscillatory component with time constant T, describes the precession
motion and determines the gyroscope's deflection in inertial space. In connection
with the discussion of a system's stability, this oscillatory component and the com-
ponent with the introduction of a derivative in the area of its frequency cutoff can
be approximated by the expression (T;/7§)/(1/p). An oscillatory component with time
constant TH describes the gyroscope's nutational oscillations and affects the sys-
tem's dynamic characteristics.

One of the simplest correcting circuits in a stabilization circuit, which makes it
possible to increase the regulator's amplification factor KP, is a nonminimal-phase,
series-connected circuit with a transfer function i the form

. Tupél —T.a-.-I -
[GI-1‘”) = mﬁ: (4.3:)

where TKJ < TXZ'

Using (as before) the frequency criterion of stability, let us determine the cor-
recting circuit's parameters and, in connection with them, the maximally achievable
amplification factor of the open system. (We will assume that l/TRJ and 1/?9 are
much larger than the nutational frequency 1/13 and that the effect of the

125
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

corresponding components on the system's dynamic characteristics can be ignored in
the first approximation.)

It is obvious that in order to achieve the maximum amplification factor it is neces-

sary that the open system's phase frequency characteristic take on the value -« at
frequency “0' as determined from the relationship

(4.36)

 

Frequencies “ll on which the amplitude frequency characteristic equals unity, is
then determined as the roots of the cubic equation

”7 - V. + ‘0. V“ — var - 4E5vs - 0. (4.37)

where v1 s ”17H' Taking into consideration the fact that EH << 1 and giving (for

lowing solution for equation (4.37):

Having obtained v0 and v1 from equations (4.36) and (4.37), the values of the cor-
recting Circuit's normalized time constants ‘kl - Tkl/TH and ‘kz - Tkz/TH can be de-
termined by solving the following system of nonlinear algebraic equations:

4.4. Dynamic Errors in a Uniaxial Stabilization System

The overwhelming majority of stabilized platforms are intended for operation on moo
bile objects. The presence of angular oscillations and vibrations is a character-
istic of these objects. Angular oscillations and vibrations of an object at the
point where a stabilized platform is installed contribute to the appearance of har
monic disturbing moments that affect the stabilization system. The causes of these
moments are residual disbalance of the platform, moments of dry and viscous friction
in the suspension axes, stress moments and so on that result in harmonic oscilla-
tions of the platform. The amplitude of these oscillations determines the stabili-
zation system's dynamic error, the allowable magnitude of which is assigned during
the planning of stabilized platforms. Let us discuss the dynamic errors of 069's
based on 2436's.

In engineering practice, dynamic errors are determined with the help of a system's
transfer functions. In order to do this, the closed system's transfer function with
respect to the stabilization angle caused by the disturbing moment is found either
analytically or with the help of closing nomograms. The modulus of this transfer
function for each frequency equals the amplitude of the platform's angular oscilla-
tions when acted upon by a unit disturbing moment along the stabilization axis. For
an 05?, the closed system's transfer function is determined by expression (4.10) .
In our analysis of dynamic errors we will discuss three characteristic frequency
areas: low frequencies, where thpH >> 1; resonance frequencies. in which modulus
pain:

13(9): is consensurate with unity; postresonance frequencies, for which the rela-
9'1”
:iOns’nip |w(p)[ << 1 occurs.

p-iu

Let us first discuss an OSP based on an one with V? and signal reading on the PD's
rotation frequency. Taking into consideration the correcting circuit transfer func-
tion (4.34) that was derived in Section 4.3. the closed system's transfer function
in the low-frequency area can be approximated by the expression

. I (T --|HT"D+|)
MP)" [(75% ‘4‘“)
I

Thus, when the disturbing moment's frequency is increased to approximately

l/max (1‘9, 1‘“), the closed system's transfer factor and, consequently, dynamic er-
ror decrease. Then, approximately to the frequency min (1/19. l/Tk3) or to frequen-
cy 1/?“ (if ‘1' > '1'“) . the system's transfer factor does not change for all practi-
ca“. purposes. gut beginning with frequency max (1/19, 1/1,“) it increases if 1'9 > Tk4'
I-chever, if ":9 < Th3, then. beginning with frequency l/‘EM the transfer factor de-
:reases. For frequencies higher than max (1/19, l/Tk4) . the transfer factor's value
again remains practically constant. The expressions for evaluating the system's
transfer factor with respect to a disturbing mment can be derived quite easily from

(4.40) and have the following form for ‘i‘g > 1'“:

cubic equation corresponding to the polynomial in the denominator of (4.49) is al-
ways greater than zero. This means that the polynomial has one real and two imagi-

in Figure 37. It is obvious that frequency

cy. while the value of relative damping
factor 62° determines the height of the

rors of an 05? when real disturbances act on the platform, as well as to select dur-
ing the planning stage those stabilization system parameters that insure that the
magnitude of the dynamic errors does not exceed the figure given in the specifica-
tions.

rived in Section 1.6 and the correcting circuit transfer function obtained in Sec-

As we did previously, for simplicity's sake we will assume TP and 7k3 to be suffi—
ciently small values and ignore them. Let us now obtain the transfer function of
the closed system for the different frequency areas.

In the low-frequency area, the expression for the closed system's transfer function
with respect to the stabilization angle takes on the form

K ),'_T:P’7+25"vT-J’+'L£L'. (4.53)

As follows from (1.111), depending on the state of the MRG's parameters, the rela—
tive damping factor Cup of the precessional oscillations can be either smaller or
greater than unity. In the second case, the second-order component in the numerator
of (4.53) decomposes into the product of two first-order components. The values of
transmission factor 1((m) , as a function of the ratio of the time constants of the
dynamic components of transfer function (4.53) in different ranges of changes in the
disturbing moment's frequencies, are presented in Table 2.

4.5. Effect of Non-Steady-State Feedback on the Operation of a Uniaxial Stabiliza-
tion System

I: has already been said that a characteristic feature of an RVG is the presence at
its outlet, along with the slowly changing component of the signal. harmonic compo-
nents with amplitudes that are proportional to the input angular velocity and fre-
quencies that are close to being multiples and composite frequencies of rotation of
the PD. since stabilization systems based on va's assume the realization of ex-
tremely high amplification factors in the stabilization circuit, when inadequate
filtration is present the signal from the RVG can cause oscillation of the platform
with inadmissibly large amplitudes or even loss of stability on the part of the sys-
tem. Therefore, when designing such systems it is necessary to analyze their sta-
bility and dynamic accuracy, with due consideration for the non-steady-state

Ignoring the effect on the system's operation of oscillations at frequency “”0 (that
is. by limiting ourselves to the approximation obtained in the first step), we ob-
tain the characteristics of the platform's settled motion when a constant disturbing

moment is acting on the axis of stabilization. The OSP's settled motion is composed
of the constant deflection velocity in inertial space and the harmonic oscillations

relative to the stabilization axis. The platform's constant deflection velocity can
be found from the expression

Thus. the effect of the OHG's non-steady-state nature on the system's static charac-
teristics is determined by coefficient K“ and coe‘f‘cient qp, which characterizes
the width of the stabilizing engine's pass band relative to frequency Zuo. as well
as the values of the amplitude and phase of the cerrecting circuit's frequency char-
acteristic on frequency Zoo. The smaller coefficient ‘8 is (and it has smaller val-
ues for platforms with large moments of inertia and when the OHG's rotor has high
frequencies of rotation). the less the effect of the non-steady-state nature. The
significant reduction in the effect of the non-steady-state nature is explained by

the fact that when the parameters of the cat's rotor are chosen appropriately
(at ‘F l) . the oscillations on the doubled frequency of rotation of the rotor are at-

tenuated. Narrowing the stabilizing engine's relative pass band (increasing qp) a1-
so reduces the effect of the non-steady-state nature on the 059's settled motion.
Expressions (4.73) and (4.74) make it possible to select the correcting circuit's
parameters in such a fashion as to insure the obtaining of the OSP's required static
characteristics.

When the stabilizing Circuit's parameters are selected in accordance with the recom-
mendations made in Section 4.3. without allowing for the effect of the OMG's non-
steady-state nature, Cﬂe static characteristics will acquire the form

vidually be stable. The first component is

a closed stabilization system that does not allow for the OMG's non-steady-state na-
ture. Its stability is insured with the help of the methods explained in Section
4.3. The second component, in which the effect of the OMG's non-steady-state nature
is allowed for. is a component with positive feedback. Its stability can be inves-
tigated with the help of frequency methods. The corresponding open system's trans-
fer function has the form

the fulfillment of the inequality

An analysis of transfer function (4.82) shows that for most systems with real param-
eters. these conditions are adequate. Expression (4.82) imposes an additional limi-
tation on the value of the open stabilization system's transmission factor. If this
inequality is not fulfilled, it is necessary to design the correcting circuit so
that inequality (4.81) is fulfilled. In connection with this. the designer should
check to see what effect this correcting circuit has on the stability and quality
indicators of the closed system described by transfer function K(p).

4.6. Multidimensional Stabilization Systems Using Rotor Vibration Gyroscopes

At the present time, 059': are in extremely limited practical use. The construction
of OSP's operating on nonstabilized bases with va's as sensitive elements makes
practically no sense. This is related to the specific nature of the RVG's them-

selves. Actually. they are fundamentally two~dimensional measurers of the base's
absolute velocities with identical sensitivity along both measuring axes. There-

fore, for a highly sensitive instrument even comparatively small angular velocities
of the base along an unstabilized axis either saturate its single-channel part or
result in contact between the rotor and the steps, which has a strong effect on the
instrument's basic characteristics or makes it generally incapable of functioning.
At the same time, the two-dimensional nature of the RVG makes it possib-e to use on-
ly one instrument for the construction of a biaxial stabilized platform. Such plat-

forms are widely used in different branches of technology. such as for the stabili-
zation of the sighting line of radio engineering and optical devices. for the deter-

mination of the plane of the horizon on a moving object. and so forth.

Let us discuss the special features of the dynamics of a 05? based on a single RVG.
assuming the system to be stationary and linear and using the vector-matrix descrip-

tion presented in Section 4.1. In this case the platform's transfer matrix has the
form

The outer diagonal elements of matrices (4.83) and (4.84) characterize the cross-
couplings between the stabilization channels that appear as a result of the presence
of kinetic moment h of the RVG's rotating part and cross-couplings in the signals
read from the RVG. Assuming that the va is operating in the resonance mode and the
level of the cross-couplings in its signals in the band of essential frequencies is
insignificant, we will first examine only the couplings with respect to the gyro-
scopic moments. If the correcting circuit and the regulator do not have specially
introduced cross-couplings and are described by diagonal transfer matrices. the
closed system's transfer matrix has the form

For stable operation of the system it is necessary and sufficient that each element

of the matrix that is the first cofactor of the product in the right side of (4.85)
be stable. These elements are determined by the expressions

Let us assume that the structure and parameters of each channel's stabilization cir-
cuits have been chosen in accordance with the recommendations presented in Section
4.3. In this case, transfer functions K2(p) and K3(p). as well as w3(p)/(l + W3(p))
and W2(p)/(l + w2(p)) have bands tsic--possibly poles] only in the left half-plane.
Then, for stability of the closed circuits relative to the summary moments that act
along the stabilization axes and are described by transfer functions (4.86), it is
required that the closed circuit that corresponds to the following transfer function

be stable:

V, (p) - h'p‘K, (p) K, (p). (4.88)

Let us discuss how kinetic moment h affects the stability of DSP's based on differ-

ent types of va's. In order to do this, we will make use of the transfer functions
for closed systems that were presented in Section 4.4. The precise values of h for

which a system loses its stability can be obtained either graphically or with the
help of computational methods. We will limit ourselves to approximate evaluations.

For an 036 with VP and reading on the rotation frequency. the phase characteristic
corresponding to transfer function (4.88) can equal -1r in the area where the ampli-
tude characteristic reaches its maximum value. Thus, in order to insure a system's

stability it is sufficient that the amplitude-frequency characteristic corresponding
to transfer function (4.88) be less than unity. This occurs when the following con-
dition is met:

h<T.,K,K,2§,.t’ "1““40 ' (4.89)

 

When condition (4.89) is fulfilled, The effect on a DSP's stability of the cross-

couplings withirespect to the gyroscopic moment that arise because of the presence
of kinetic moment h in the 836's rotating part can be ignored.

For systems based on RVG's that have a transfer function that is the same as that of

a DMG with VP and reading on the zero frequency. an analogous estimate can be ob-
tained from the closed system transfer function described by expression (4.54). In

connection with this. the sufficient condition for the system's stability will. ob-
viously, be the fulfillment of the inequality

’1 < max [mod (is!) K (im)|. (4.90)

Having determined the maxim value of the system's AChKh, we obtain the limitations

imposed on the “36's kinetic mment. when these limitations are observed. the ef-
fect of h on a DSP's stability can be ignored.

Let us asstmae that the kinetic moment of the MRG's rotating part is small and that
its effect on a system's stability can be ignored. Now we will discuss the effect
on a DSP's stability of the cross-couplings in the site's signal that are determined
by the outer diagonal elements of matrix (4.4). In this case the closed system's
transfer function has the form

We will assume that stability is provided in each stabilisation channel by the meth-
od explained in Section 4.3. The closed circuits described by transfer functions

In the right side of (4.93), let us substitute the expressions for the transfer
functions of a system's components, allowing for possible minor detuning 6 of the
MEG from the resonance mode. For an 0M6 with V? and reading on the rotation fre-
quency we then obtain

(4.94)

The system's stability is determined by the behavior of frequency characteristic
Wo(iw) in the section where the phase characteristic takes on the value I. In con-
nection with this, a sufficient condition for stability is the requirement that the
frequency characteristic's absolute value remain less than unity at all times. From
{4.94) it follows that for minor detunings of the instrument from the resonance mode
(6 << E). when the approximation of the mac's transfer functions is made competently
the detuning has practically no effect on the DSP's stability. An analysis of the
frequency characteristic in the area where its absolute value reaches a maximum,
with due consideration for the basic relationships derived in Sections 4.3 and 4.4,
shcws that the signal cross-couplings existing in the M36 as the result of the plat-
form's angular accelerations also do not affect the DSP's stability.

37 using the transfer functions for different RVG layouts that were derived in Chap-
ter 1, in an analogous manner we can--with the help of the transfer function (4.93)
of some open system-~evaluate according to the frequency criterion the effect of
cross-couplings in the RVG on the DSP's stability.

An investigation of cross-couplings in a DSP showed that for sufficiently large val-
ues of h. the correction discussed in Section 4.3 may not provide the system with
the required amplification factors and dynamic characteristics. A special case of
such systems is an astatic gyroscope. corrected with respect to deflection velocity
with the help of signals from an arc installed in the gyro chamber [7]. Therefore.
let us discuss a US? with due consideration for the cross-couplings between channels
with respect to the gyroscopic moment. For the sake of simplification, we will as-
sume that the values of the stabilization channels' parameters are approximately the
same. It can be shown that nonfulfillment of this condition within quite broad lim-
its does not lead to substantial quantitative changes in the results that are ob-
tained. At the same time. such an assumption makes it possible to use the previous-
ly mentioned method of complex transfer functions and to reduce the order of magni-
tude of the investigated system by a factor of two. The structural diagram of a DSP
constructed with the use of complex transfer funccions for the components and vector
coordinates, without allowing for transience. is presented in Figure 44.

 

Figure 44. Structural diagram of a US? with identical channels.

The platform's complex transfer function has the form

WNW'TT—‘F—seu' . (4.95)

where T, - Iu/h; k - uﬁ/h. The MRG's transfer functions were derived in complex
form in Section 1.6 and can usually be approximated in the band of essential fre-

quencies by simpler expressions. In the diagram we have introduced the demodula-
tor's vector transmission factor

- I it
which allows for a possible phase shift t in the demodulator or (which is the same)
rotation through angle t of the MRG's sensitivity axes relative to the stabilization
axes. If there are no cross-couplings with respect to the men's signals between the

channels. 5 determines the nature of the control of the stabilizing engines. For

t - 0 we will call it cross control, while for c - r/2 we will call it direct con-
trol and for O < c < n/2 it is mixed control. In general form, the correcting cir-
cuit can introduce additional cross-couplings between the channels for the purpose
of obtaining maximum amplification factors in the stabilization circuit. The regu-
lator‘s transfer function describes the dynamics of the stabilizing engines.

Let us discuss DSP's based on an MR6 of a different type. when an CMG with V? and
reading on the rotor's rotation frequency is used, when TP << T, and the amplifica-
tion factor equals unity, the frequency characteristic of the open system takes on
the form depicted in sigure 45. From Figure 45 it follows that when the open sys-
tem's amplification factor is

the closed system is absolutely stable. Without using correcting elements in the
stabilization circuit, for large amplification factors 06? operational stability can
be insured only in the case of direct control of the stabilizing engines (c - n/Z).
However, the system is then almost at the limit of stability. so that allowing for
small time constants for the stabilizing engine, amplifiers and other elements in
the system leads it into instability.

The achievement of stable operation of a system by including series-connected cor-
rccting elements in the stabilization circuit can be accomplished in two ways. The
first presumes that the system's cutoff frequency is higher than the frequency 1/1“I
of the platform's nutational oscillations. so that it is advisable to use direct
control of the stabilizing engines. while the correcting circuit‘s structure should
be the one explained in Section 4.3. This way makes it possible to realize extreme-
ly high amplification fattors in the stabilization circuit. but at the same time it
broadens the system‘s pass band considerably. Therefore, it is used primarily for
”heavy“ platforms (with large moments of inertia I") based on an MRS with a small
kinetic moment h. For "light” platforms with a high nutation frequency it is possi-
ble to use a nonminimal-phase correcting circuit with a transfer function of the
type of (4.35) and a time constant Th1 = JSEI. In this case, the stabilizing en-
gines should be cross-controlled. With such correction and amplitude stability re-
serve A - 6 dB, the open system's amplification factor can be estimated from the
express on

The increase in the amplification factor is achieved by the appropriate choice of
time constants Tk3 and Tk4 of the integrating-61fferentiating component.

Let us discuss a DSP based on a DMG with VP and reading on the zero frequency. For
our analysis we will use its approximated transfer function (1.109) For a unit amp-
1ification factor, the open system's frequency characteristics have the form shown
in Figure 46. An analysis of the frequency characteristics shows that in the case
of a "heavy“ platform. for which 1/T, << 1/TH. the correcting circuit's structure
and the technique for selecting the parameters remains the same as for an OSP. In
connection with this. direct control of the stabilizing engines is realized.

that is based on a DMG.

For a "light” platform, where the frequencies of the mac's and platform's nutational
oscillations are close to each other. preliminary so-called "phasing in“ of the sys-
tem is required. This is achieved by additional cross control of the stabilizing
engines (c f O). In order to insure stability of the phased-in system it is possi-
ble to use a series~connected nonminimal- hase correcting element with transfer
function (4.35) and time constant Tkl = 3T for l/T, < l/TH or Tkl = “5&8 for

l/T" < 1/T,. In connection with this, the system's amplification factor can be
found from expression (4.39), while the increase in it is achieved because of the
appropriate choice of Tk3 and Tk4.

Let us discuss the effect of cross-couplings with respect to the gyroscopic moments
of the MRG's rotating part and the MRG's signals on the stability of a TSP. From
equations of motion (4.18) it follows that if we ignore the other cross-couplings in
the TSP and assume each separate channel described by transfer function Kitp) to be
stable, the system coupled with respect to the 335': gyroscopic moments will be sta-
ble when the component with a transfer function of the following type is stable:

KW” " WWW—WW (4-99)

If the TSP is based on two MRG's, then--depending on which channels are duplicated--
one of the hi must be set equal to zero. The stability of this element can be
checked with the help of frequency methods. according to its transfer function in

The sufficient condition for stability that states that the absolute value of
woman) not exceed unity can serve as an approximate evaluation of the effect of the
Mac's kinetic moments on the TSP's stability. In connection with this, if the chan-
nels are assumed to be identical. several understated maximally allowable values are
obtained for h, as determined by the inequality

V1.54. n: + up max [mod K"(I’u)]. (4.101)
When three identical m's are used, this equality takes on the form

while when the TSP is based on two identical MRG's, it is
’1 : V‘fmaxhnoll K" (“1!"- (4.1.03)

The limitations obtained for the magnitude of the HRG's kinetic ment differ from
the analogous limitations for a US? only by coefficients 1/5 or 1/5. In view of
this, the conditionunder which we can ignore the effect of h on the stability of a
TSP based on an one with V? and having stabilization circuits with the structure de-
scribed in Section 4.3, is obtained from (4.39) by premultiplying the right side of '
the inequality by 1/5 or 1/5, depending on whether the system is based on three or
two 3135's. Thus, when condition (4.1.01) is fulfilled, the effect of cross-couplings
with respect to the gyroscopic moments of the HRG's rotating parts on the dynamics
of a TSP can be ignored.

The necessary and sufficient condition for stability of a TSP with cross-couplings
with respect to the MRG's signals, when stability of each separate channel is in-

sured and other cross-couplings are ignored, is stability of the component with the

For identical MRG's and values of the separate stabilization channels' parameters

tion for he ESP only in that its absolute value is premultiplied by a factor of

Thus, as was the case for a DSP, when a platform is based on an ONE with VP, cross-
couplings with respect to the MRG‘s signals have practically no effect on the sta-
bility of a TSP when detunings of the signals from the resonance mode are quite
minor.

4.7. Effect of Transient Feedback on the Operation of a Multidimensional Stabiliza-
tion System

A mathematical description of a linear. multidimensional stabilization system based
on va's, with due consideration for the transient signal components existing in the
RVG's, was presented in Section 4.1. In this section we will concentrate in more
detail on the investigation of the effect of the non-steady-state nature (tran-
sience) of the sensitive elements' signals on the operation of multidimensional sta-
bilization systems. In connection with this, we will limit ourselves only to sys-
tems based on RVG's with single modulation and VP and with single modulation and KP
for which condition (1.22) is fulfilled. Figure 47 is a structural diagram of such
a system. In accordance with this diagram, the closed system's equation of motion
can be written as:

In order to investigate the effect of the transience. we will make use of the tech-
nique explained in Section 1.5. In order to do it, we rewrite equation of motion
(4.106) in a more convenient form:

:f the system's filtering properties are such that we can ignore the components on
the left side of (4.108) that contain harmonic factors changing with frequency 4mg,
then for the analysis of the system's properties we obtain a stationary linear ma-
trix equation that is investigatable by well-known techniques. In this case, When
acted upon by a constant disturbing moment H3, an SP‘s steady motion is composed of

the 59‘s permanent deflection velocity in inertial space, which can be found from
the expression

When investigating the effect of RMG transience on a stabilization system's stabili-
t7, the latter can be represented as two series-connected multidimensional systems.
Cne of them is described by the transfer matrix K(p) of a closed stabilization sys-
tem, with no allowance for ave transience. This system's stability is insured with-
cut fail when the parameters of the regulators and the correcting elements in the
Stabilization circuits are chosen properly. Therefore, in order for the SP to be
stable while allowing for 396 transience, it is necessary and sufficient that the
multidimensional closed system with the following transfer function be stable:

:5 the system's filtering properties are not sufficient so as to be limited by al-
lowing for the second harmonic of the PD's rotation frequency in accordance with the
technique explained in Section 1.5, it is necessary to derive the second-step equa-
tion and so on, until the accuracy required for the investigation is achieved.

Let us discuss in more detail a 05? based on a single HRS. If the values of the
stabilization channels' parameters are about the same and the differences between
1333 can be ignored, the system should be investigated with the help of the tech-
ﬂique developed in [16]. By introducing complex transfer functions and system to-
ordinates, we will represent its structural diagram in the form depicted in Figure

Provided that the stationary closed circuit is stable, the DSP's stability with the

when the system‘s parameters are known. expressions (4.123) make it possible to de-

termine the additional requirements for the correcting circuit in the stabilization

circuit. What these requirements come down to is that on frequency Zuo the circuit
st amplify the signal and form the required value of its phase. Since h is small.

system stability is insured (without allowing for transience) by the methods de-

scribed in Section 4.3 when direct control of the stabilizing engines is used.

Then. provided that the stabiiizing engine's aperiodic lag is compensated for

The system under discussion will be stable if the open system's transfer function
fulfills the condition for stability with respect to the frequency criterion:

Wm!) = Wan) 4: V: (p — 1‘20»). (4.125)

Transfer function (4.125) has complex coefficients, so in order to judge the sys-
tem's stability it is necessary to examine the corresponding frequency characterist-
ic in the frequency band - < u < a. From expression (4.125) it is obvious that
when correcting circuits (4.34) and (4.124) are used, the behavior of frequency
characteristic (4.125) in the band u < -u2, where u; is the cutoff frequency of the
steady-state system's frequency characteristic, meets the stability criterion.
Since frequency characteristic (4.125) is symmetrical relative to frequency mo, of
which one can convinCe oneself from (4.122), it is sufficient to examine its beha-
vior in the band of essential frequencies of the system's steady-state part. In
this range (m < mo), mod w3(im - i2mo) < 1. Let us determine how component

"3(iw - i2u0) affects the frequency characteristic's behavior near the steady-state
system's cutoff frequency w;.

tion 4.3, we find the modulus of frequency characteristic (4.126):

Pram (4.128) it follows that in the area of frequency ”2' where mod Hc(iu) of the
frequency characteristic of the steady-state part of the system takes on values
close to unity, mod w;(iu2 - izuo) << 1. Therefore, when determining stability the
second component in the right side of the open system's transfer equation (4.125)

can be ignored. Thus, for the chosen correcting circuit parameters, the presence of
RVG transience does not affect a DSP's stability.

Let us discuss the static characteristics of a USP based on an 0M6 with V? when ad-

ditional correcting circuit (4.124) is used. When acted upon by a constant disturb-
ing moment, the platform is deflected from its initial position through a constant
angle that is determined from the expression

When the given operational accuracy and the known values of the disturbances are

which is on the order of angular seconds and can reach tens of angular seconds.
When such oscillation amplitudes are not allowable, it is not feasible to use cor-
recting circuit (4.123) to eliminate systematic platform deflections caused by con-
stant disturbing moments.

When p1a:form deflections caused by the effect of constant disturbing moments are

eliminated, the p1atform--as follows from (4.113)--wi11 still have a systematic

ﬂ, - M.,.e"’“"- (4.133)

The expression for determining the magnitude of the deflection as a function of the
disturbing moment's amplitude is found easily from (4.113) and has the form

5,. = w;(:2..,,):9;(i2».)mA_ (4.134)

The dependence of the platform’s deflection on "EA! expressed in terms of the sys-
tem's parameters, is determined quite accurately by the simple expression

RVG errors can also lead to both systematic deflections of the platform and the ap-

pearance of a constant angle of its deflection from the position it initially occu-
pied in inertial space.

As was shown in Chapter 2, MRS errors can be represented in the form of an equiva-
lent angular velooity 5; acting on the instrument's input. The effect of angular
velocity 6; on an MRG's input is equivalent to the effect on the stabilization axes
of equivalent disturbing moment

We will discuss only those errors that result in the equivalent angular velocity de-
scribed by the expression

54 = ‘3» + ﬂur'w. (4. 137)

Where 6 = constant angular velocity, while 5;“ - amplitude of the angular vibra-

By substituting (4.138) into expressions (4.131) and (4.134), we obtain the depend-
ence of the velocity of the platform's systematic deflection and its angular deflec-
tion in inertial space on MEG errors:

Thus. when the method under discussion is used to construct a stabilization system.
the platform's systematic deflections are determined by the base's linear and angu-
lar vibrations with frequency Zoo, the angular vibrations of the MRG's rotating part
in the main rotation supports relative to its axes of sensitivity on the same fre-
quency. and the errors in the MEG itself.

Let us discuss the possibility of eliminating systematic DSP deflection caused by
the effect of constant disturbing moments on the stabilization axes when the MRG's

rotating part has a large kinetic moment. From Section 4.6 it follows that in this
case it is advisable to use cross-control of the stabilizing engines (5 - C), while
in order to achieve system stability for large amplification factors it is possible
to use a series-connected, nonminimal-phase correcting circuit with transfer func-
tion (4.34). It is obvious that when K“ < 1 and the aperiodic lag in the stabiliz-
ing engines is compensated for, conditions (4.120) can be fulfilled by (for example)
the additional connection in series in the stabilizing circuit of a resonance ampli-
fier and a nonminimal-phase correcting element. The transfer function of such an
additional correcting circuit takes on the form

As in the case of small values of h, it can be shown that when the amplification

not have any substantial effect on the system's stability.

ducing into the system direct control of

the stabilizing engines (6 - -H/2). reducing the open system's amplification factor
by a factor of K“. and including in the stabilizing circuit a correcting element
with the structural diagram shown in Figure 49. If these frequencies are so close
together that the additional correcting circuit has an effect on the dynamics of the
entire system, the choice of the structure and parameters of the stabilizing circuit
must be made from the very beginning with due consideration for MRS transience.

The elimination of systematic DSP deflections because of the effect of constant dis-
turbing moments takes place only when conditions (4.120) are fulfilled exactly. In
practice. however, the precise realization of a system's desired frequency charac-

: ristic and its maintenance during operation are impossible, since the parameters
of the system's elements can change in time. depending on the temperature and other
operating conditions. This leads to a change in the values of the modulus and argu-
ment of frequency characteristic H;(iw) on frequency w - Zmo. Let us give these
changes in the form of small increments of the rated values:

(4.144)
Inaccurate realization of the open system's frequency characteristic with respect to
amplitude leads to DSP deflections relative to the same axis around which the dis-
turbing moment acts, while a phase error results in deflection with respect to the
cross axis. Expression (4.144) makes it possible to evaluate the requirements for
accuracy in maintaining the values of the system's parameters as a function of the
acting disturbing moments and the allowable systematic OS? deflections.

Thus, the special use features, which consist of the presence at its output of two
useful signal components--one slowly changing, while the other is amplitude
modulated, withua carrier frequency that is double the rotor's frequency of rota-
tion--makes it possible to realize a fundamentally new approach to the construction
of.a stabilization system. It presumes the creation of those conditions for the
passage through the system of a signal on the doubled frequency of rotation of the
rotor for which there occurs full compensation for the constant disturbing moments
acting on the system. Such an approach makes it possible to reduce significantly _
the systematic deflections of an SP based on a ENG that are caused by constant dis-
turbing moments, without any substantial increase in the amplification factor in the
stabilizationlcircuit, which usually entails a number of technical difficulties.‘

CHAPTER 5. Wk VIBRATION GYROSCOPES IN THE DEPLECTIW CORRECTIW CIRCUIT OF A
GYROSCOPIC STABILIZATICN SYSTEM

5.1. Description of Stabilization Systems With a Deflection Correction Circuit

In chapter 4 we discussed the possibility of using MRG's as the basic sensitive ele-
ments in stabilization systems. It was shown that the construction of such systems
with deflections on a level close to the MRG's threshold of sensitivity involves
overcoming a whole series of difficulties engendered by the requirement for realiz-
ing high amplification factors in the stabilization circuit.

There is another way to use va's in stabilization systems: the construction of an
additional 65? deflection correction (K11) circuit. In this case the GSP is built

according to the well-known principle, using two-stage gyroscopic units of the tra-
ditional type. 0n the platform there are additional RVG's that measure its rate of
deflection in inertial space. Figure 50 is a kinematic diagram of such a GSP. The
signals from the RVG's are fed into DM's [demodulator] mounted on the precession ax-

es of the corresponding gyroscopes or on the stabilizing motors in such a fashion as
to compensate for the GSP's deflections.

Such integration in a system of traditional gyroscopes and RVG's makes it possible
to obtain a whole series of advantages. In the first place, the accuracy

156
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

requirements for the GSP's basic gyroscopic units are lowered, which makes it possi-
ble to use small and inexpensive gyroscopes, since the realization of the required
deflection value is insured by the KU circuit. Secondly, the accuracy of the RVG's
operation is improved because they are mounted on a stabilized area and the basic
disturbances are countered by a stabilization circuit with a traditional gyroscope.
In the third place, the division of the basic functions between a stabilization cir-
cuit with a traditional gyroscope, which provides the system's required dynamic
characteristics, and a KU circuit with an RVG, which provides the required systemat-
ic deflection value. makes it possible to realize both circuits with simpler means.
Finally, there is an improvement in the system's reliability because if the RVG goes
out of order there is no cessation of the GSP's functioning.

The shortcoming in this way of using RVG's is the limited possibility of miniaturiz-
ing the GSP, since the system's instrument complement includes three traditional
gyroscopic units with moment sensors and at least two RVG's. The use in the system
of a single RVG, for deflection correction with respect to the platform's two most
critical axes, can be assumed.

Let us examine a single gyroscopic stabilization channel. Its structural diagram is
represented by two closed circuits [2), of which the inner one reflects feedback
with respect to the gyroscopic moment, while the outer one reflects it with respect
to the stabilizing engine's moment. Such a layout is easily reduced to single-
circuit form and is usually analyzed as a unidimensional system with two inputs with
respect to the disturbing moments acting along the stabilization and precession ax-
es. Possible circuits for external correction and control of a CS? usually differ
substantially with respect to the frequency pass band, so their operation is dis-
cussed separately only within the framework of precession theory [25], which simpli-
fies the investigation considerably. Hhen building a GSP Kn circuit, as has been
shown in a number of works [7-9]. in order to reduce the deflections to values close
to the RVG's threshold of sensitivity, it is necessary to realize high amplification
factors in the KU. This makes it impossible to discuss the operation of the K0 and
stabilization circuits separately, since such an approach can result in fundamental-
ly incorrect results.

with due consideration for the remarks that have been made, let us examine, in a
linear and steady-state formulation of the problem, the structural diagram of a sin-
gle 63? channel with a KU circuit, as depicted in Figure 51. A 65? channel with a
KU circuit is a two-dimensional, two-channel system with cross-couplings. The input
of one channel in the system is the disturbing moment M; with respect to the stabil-
ization axis, while its output is the platform stabilization angle on. The second
channel's input is the disturbing moment M31 with respect to the gyroscope's preces-
sion axes, while its output is the gyroscope precession angle 6. Between the chan-
nels in the object being regulated there exists a negative, antisymmetrical cross-
:oupling with respect to the gyroscopic moments. Angles a, and 8 are measured, re-
spectively, by an RVG with transfer function Wg(p) and a precession angle sensor
(DC?) with transmission factor KDUP- The signals from the RVC (01) and the DU? (02)
enter a regulator, which in general form can also be represented as a two-
dimensional element with direct cross-couplings.

Let us discuss in more detail the physical meaning of the transfer functions that
describe the regulator. Function 321(p) is the transfer function of the stabiliza-
tion circuit. which contains transforming and amplifying elements, a correcting cir-
cuit and a stabilizing engine. Function W 2(p) reflects the feedback that can en-
compass the gyroscope itself. When a GSP is based on integrating gyroscopes, there
is usually no feedback. However, when angular velocity sensors (DOS) with an elec-
tric spring are used as the basic sensitive elements, this connection describes the
properties of the circuit forming the electric spring. It can also be used to
change the GSP's dynamics and, in particular, to limit the precession angles.
Transfer functions w11(p) and ”21(p) describe the circuits in the KU circuit. The
signal from the RVG can be used simultaneously for deflection correction through the
circuit described by transfer function "21(p) and to counter disturbances aeting
aLong the stabilization axis, as occurs when an RVG is used as the basic sensitive

element of a stabilization system, through the circuit described by transfer func-
tion W11(p) .

Since each 65? stabilization channel is a two-dimensional system and is described by
matrix transfer functions. in order to describe bi- and triaxial GSP's it is com-
pletely natural to use block matrices for the purpose of achieving greater compact-
ness and better visibility [11]. In order to do this, we will introduce the sys-
tem's coordinates in the following manner:

Along the main diagonal of the platform' s transfer matrix W (9) there are transfer
matrices that characterize for each stabilization channel the relationship between
the vector of the platform’ s deflection angle 51 and the moment acting along the
corresponding stabilizing axis (M1 + Mei). The nondiagonal elements of matrix

wﬂ(p) describe the cross-couplings existing in the platform between the stabiliza-
tion channels. These couplings are engendered by the platform's centrifugal moments

of inertia, its motion relative to the gyroscopes' axes of precession and the kinet-
ic moments of the driven motors of the RVG's mounted directly on the platform. In

accordance with the well-known equations of motion of a CS? [24], the elements of
matrix H (p) can be determined from the following equation:

The static characteristics are one of the most important indicators of the quality
of a GSP's performance. Let us see how the addition of a ICU circuit affects a GSP's
static characteristics. We will consider a single GS? channel. The solution of a
GSP's equation of motion written in operator form can be obtained from the structur-
al diagram shown in Figure 52, and has the following form:

of a maximum transition to (5.13) for p -' O:

Giving the elements of matrix 1((0) in terms of the system's parameters, we obtain a
general expression that makes it possible to determine the static characteristics
of a 65? with a KU circuit for different types of GSP's. It is obvious that for

K(O) this expression has the form

Let us examine the static characteristics of different types of GSP's. For GSP's
based on two-stage integrating gyroscopes with ball-bearing supports along the pre-
cession axes (so-called “dry” gyroscopes), the small amount of viscous friction

along the precession axes is typically negligible (DB - 0). In these gyroscopes
there is no positional feedback; that is, K22 - 0. The static characteristics for a

GS? of this type that uses a differentiating RVG in the Ku circuit take on the form

Thus, when a RU circuit with a differentiating RVG is used, relative to the disturb-
ing moment acting along the stabilization axis, the GSP remains astatic, with first-
order astaticism, with respect to stabilization angle a“. When a constant disturb-
ing moment acts along the precession axis. the systematic deflection in inertial

space of a GSP with KU is n times smaller than for an analogous 659 without a KU
circuit:

)k

(5.19)

n-l+—SK_1K”' , (5.20)

From (5.20) it follows that the realization in the KU circuit of quite large ampli-
fication factors is required in order for a substantial reduction in CS? deflection
to be achieved. De nding on the accuracy of the GSP itself, these factors can
reach values of (10 -1o4)3. A GSP's static characteristics with respect to the
gyroscope's precession angle do not change, for all practical purposes. The preces-
sion angle of a 65? with Kn remains the same as for a noncorrected GSP, but when
acted upon by Hal it can increase because of the introduction of a feedback circuit
with transmission factor K11.

With respect to the stabilization angle, a GSP with a KU circuit based on an inte-
grating RVG has second-order astaticism relative to disturbing moment H3. In con-
nection with this, a disturbing moment along the precession axis leads to a static
error relative to the stabilization angle that is inversely proportional to the cor-
rection circuit's transmission factor “1321- The largerthestabilization circuit's

transmission factors Kbupxlz are, the smaller the deflections with respect to the
gyroscope's angle of precession.

In GSP's based on flotation integrating gyroscopes (PIG). there is also no position-

al feedback encompassing the gyroscope (K22 . 0), although the value of ”a is quite
large. The static characteristics of these GSP's with a KU circuit are described by
the following expressions:

In the first mode, the systematic deflections and static error of a GSP with a KU
circuit are reduced in comparison with a standard 68? by a factor as large as that
that occurs in a GSP based on "dry" gyroscopes. In the second mode. the GSP becomes
astatic with respect to moment M3, while when a moment acts along the precession ax-
is the static error is inversely proportional to the correction circuit's transmis-
sion factor K1K21. In both cases, the higher the stabilization circuit's transmis-
sion factor Koupxlz, the smaller the deflections with respect to the gyroscope's
precession angle.

The static'characteristics of a GS? based on angular velocity sensors and having a

Since the existing 008': based on traditional two-stage gyroscopes have a high sen-
sitivity threshold, quite high 65? accuracy can be obtained because of a Kn circuit
alone. A reduction in systematic deflections (in the case of the use of differenti-
ating RVG's) and static errors (in the case of RVG operating in the integrating
mode) when the system is acted upon by disturbing moments “B and M81 can be achieved
by increasing transmission factor K21Kg or transmission factor Kllxg. The effect-
iveness of each of these methods is determined by the ratio of the rigidity along
the gyroscope's precession axis Koupkzz to the stabilization Circuit's transmission
factor KDUPKIZu The larger this ratio is, the more effective (from the viewpoint of
improving static characteristics) is the use of a correcting circuit with transmis-

sion factor K11. As K12 is increased, there is a decrease in the gyroscope's steady

angle of rotation with respect to the precession axis when the system is acted upon
by constant moment 331, while when K11 is increased, the same thing occurs when mo-
ment M3 is acting upon the system.

Thus. although for the first two types of GSP's a circuit with transmission factor
K11 played only a negative role from the viewpoint of improving the static charac-
teristics, because it enlarged angle 8 when moment M31 was present, for a 65? based
on a D05 this circuit turns out to have a positive effect.

Let us discuss the_§tatic errors of a 65? acted upon by an interference signal de-
scribed by vector f. Directly from the structural diagram in Figure 52, it follows
that the dependence of 51 on f is described by the expression

5- - K(p)w.(p)w,-(,.)7. (5.25)

Giving this expression in terms of the system's parameters and converting to the

limit for p s 0' we obtain expressions for determining the GSP's static errors.

Prom expressions (5.26) and (5.27) it follows that for a GSP with a KU circuit, when
the ampli ication factors in the KU circuit are sufficiently high, the systematic
aeflections are determined basically by the magnitude of the avc's error, as reduced
to an equivalent angular velocity at its output, and cannot be changed substantially
by the choice of the stabilization or correction circuit's parameters. In order to
control such a GSP in the presence of external signals, the point of application of
the control actions must be in the RVG's output circuit. The rate of generation of
the control action is also determined from expressions (5.26) or (5.27).

As was already pointed out in Section 5.1, the basic purpose of a systematic deflec-
tion correction circuit is to reduce GSP deflections arising because of the effect
of slowly changing disturbing moments. From an analysis of the static errors of a
639 with a KU circuit it follows that for the successful solution of this problem,
it is necessary to realize in the KU circuit extremely high amplification factors,
which usually comes into conflict with the requirement for stable operation of the
system. Therefore, as an original prerequisite for the determination of the KU cir-
cuit's structure and parameters we will adopt the requirement that the maximum pos-
sible amplification factors be obtained in it while maintaining sufficient system
stability reserves with respect to phase and amplitude.

Prom expression (5.13) it follows that the closed system's transfer matrix can be
written in the form

In order that the system be stable, it is necessary and sufficient that all the com-
ponents of transfer matrix K(p) be stable. This occurs when the regulator is stable
and the system's characteristic polynomial has all its roots in the left half-plane
of the complex plane. we will assume the first condition to be fulfilled and turn
to the analysis of the second. ‘

Allowing for the fact that for GSP's based on integrating gyroscopes there is no
feedback encompassing the gyroscope, while feedback described by transfer function
"11(p) is not feasible from the viewpoint of the static characteristics. for the
discussion of this type of 65? we will set H11(p) - "22(p) - 0. The characteristic
polynomial then acquires a simpler form:

Providing the required dynamic characteristics in a CS? depends primarily on the
stabilization circuit, so we will assume that the latter's structure and parameters
have been selected to be the same as those of an uncorrected 65?. With due consid-

eration for this assumption, let us discuss separately two types of GSP's based on
integrating gyroscopes.

For a GS? of an astatic type. the most preferable for of correction in the stabilié
zation circuit is a nonminimal-phase correcting circuit with a transfer function of

the same type as (4.35) for Th3 - Tkz - o [12]. Let us write transfer function

For normal stability reserves ' th respect to phase and amplitude, the stabilization
circuit has the following parameters [12]: tk = 1.7; Klz/ﬂwo 3 0.2: t. >> 1. For
such parameters and a GSP using an 0H6 with V? in the deflection correction circuit,

transfer function (5.31) is approximated quite accurately in the area of essential
frequencies by the simple expression

the system will remain stable without additional correcting circuits in this circuit
(521(9) - K2 )1 that is. the correction system has practically no effect on the op-
eration of the stabilization system. Thus. the better the HRG's filtering proper-
ties (the larger f is), the higher the values of the amplification factors in the
correction circuit that can be obtained without using additional correcting compo-
nents. An increase in the allowable amplification factor Kd can be achieved by the

inclusion in the deflection correction circuit of a series-connected filtering ele-
ment with the transfer function

For the formation of such an element in the deflection correction circuit it is pos-

By selecting the appropriate values of :21 it is possible to realize practically any

values of K6 in the system, which means that its deflections will be determined only
by the mac errors.

In addition to nonminimal-phase elements, aperiodic correcting elements are used for
correcting GSP's of the astatic type. In these cases the closed system's frequency
characteristics differ little from each other. although when aperiodic elements are
used the platform's nutational oscillations are damped more weakly, so the allowable

values of ad turn out to be smaller. It is also possible to increase K4 by using
additional correcting element (5.34).

ha dynamic characteristics of a 65? with a EU circuit are determined by the closed
system's transfer function Kn(p). when conditions 79 >> 1, :21 >> 1., 1". >> 1 are

along with decreasing a GSP's systematic deflections by a factor of l + Kd, a KU
circuit also reduces the amplitude of its induced oscillations when it is acted upon
by low-frequency disturbances. The boundary of the area of frequencies in which the
reduction of the amplitude of the forced oscillations takes place depends on the
transmission factor in the in circuit. If

the denominator in expression (5.36) breaks down into two aperiodic components. In

nent depends both on Rd and on the relationship of the time constants t9 and ‘21 of

In order to reduce the effect of resonance phenomena on frequency (5.40) on the ac-

be one for which the value of the relative damping factor is at its highest.

when a DHG with VP or any other ENG having a transfer function of the form of
(1.109) is used as the sensitive element in a deflection correction circuit, the
frequency of the DMG's nutational oscillations can be greater ‘“H > uo) or less

(mg < mo) than the frequency of the platform's nutational oscillations. Coincidence
of the nutational frequencies of the DM6 and the platform should be avoided, since
this mode (as is obvious from (5.31)) is most unfavorable for the operation of a 65?
with a deflection correction circuit. If on > we, the system's stability is deter-
mined by the behavior of the frequency characteristic corresponding to transfer

function (5.31) in the area of frequency m“. In this case the allowable value of Kd
is

K‘ < 25.1.»... (5.42)

where T, - time constant of the DHG's precessional oscillations.

When ”0 < w" [sic], all the discussions taking place for a 65? with an 0M6 are cor-
rect, while the allowable values of Kd can be found from (5.33) and (5.35) if t9 in
them is replaced by the time constant of the OMG's precessional oscillations.

In all of the described cases. it is also possible to increase amplification factor
Kd by including in the deflection correction circuit a series-connected nonminimal-
phase correctin element of the type of (4.35), with a time constant TX I ’5 or, for
“H < ”0' 7K e 3(1/u3). In this case, however, for large values of “d the deflec-
tion correction circuit actually determines the 659's dynamics.

The second type of GSP's in widespread use at the present time are the so-called
static GSP's, which are based on flotation integrating gyroscopes. They are charac-
terized by quite strong damping with respect to the gyroscope's precession axis, in
connection with which the oscillatory component in the numerator of the controlled
object's transfer function usually breaks down into two aperiodic components. In
order to insure stability and the high quality of the regulation process while main-
taining the required amplification factors in the stabilization circuit, series-
connected correcting components with the introduction of derivatives are used (12].

In the simplest case a component with the introduction of the first derivative is
used; its transfer function is:

wu(p)—K,,7T.:f‘+l'. r,>7-,. (5.43)

In this case, in the band of essential frequencies of the system, transfer function
(5.30) is approximated by the following expression [12]:

When an CHG with V? is used to correct platform deflections, a sufficient condition
for stability of the system is the requirement that the modulus of the frequency
characteristic corresponding to transfer function (5.44) not exceed unity in the

area of frequencies close to l/To. When T3 > To and there is no additional correct-
ing component in the deflection correction circuit. the sufficient condition is ful-
filled if the amplification factor in the deflection correction circuit satisfies

the inequality

“<73”: 21.30 Wynw V tuftw) (5.45)

As in the case of an astatic 65?. an increase in amplification factor Kd can be
achieved by intensifying the correction circuit's filtering properties by connecting
inertial components with (for example) a transfer function of the type of (5.34).

when Mac's having a transfer function of the (1.109) type (such as a DHG with V?)
are used in the deflection correction circuit, the relationship between frequency
l/To and the MRG's nutational frequency is of considerable importance. If the MRG's
nutational frequency is considerably higher than l/To, the allowable values of Kd
can be evaluated with the help of inequality (5.45). In the opposite case, the sys-
tem's stability will be determined by the behavior of the frequency characteristic
close to frequency w“. When inequality

either loses its stability or is close to the limit of stability. In this case. de-
pending on the specific parameters of the GS? and the RVs. “d can be increased eith-
er by intensifying the deflection correction circuit's filtering properties, or by
using a series-connected correcting component with the introduction of the first de-
rivative of T3 > TH! or by using a nonminimal-phase component T3 < To.

Let us now discuss GSP's in which the gyroscope is encompassed by direct feedbGCR:
or SSP's based on angular velocity sensors. For simplicity's sake we will assume
that the feedback is realized in an ideal manner; that is. sztp) . K22. This oc-
car: when a mechanical spring having rigidity K22 is installed on the gyroscope's
precession axis. The simplest type of such platforms are direct gyrostabilizers
(N63) {26]. in which the gyroscope serves to reduce the amplitude of the platform's
forced oscillations in a certain frequency band. NGS's are built on the principle
of a mechanical oscillation absorber. so the coupling described by transfer function
w12(p) is usually absent in them. In practice it is frequently required to have a
simultaneous reduction in the forced oscillations of a platform caused by the base's
low-frequency oscillations and its vibrations, the spectrum of which has explicitly
expressed maximums. The solution of this problem by expanding the stabilization
SYsSOm's working frequency band meets with obvious difficulties. Therefore. there
is interest in a system realized as if with two stabilization circuits. the first of
which is based on an RVG and reduces the platform oscillations caused by the low-
:reqtency disturbing moments, while the second utilizes the principle of a gyroscop-
i: oscillation absorber and reduces the platform's forced oscillations in the given
frequency band of vibrations of the base. The transform function of this closed
system with respect to the stabilization angle is derived easily from (5.28) and has
the form

From (5.48) it is possible to select the NOS parameters for which the given reduc-
tion in the amplitude of the platform's forced oscillations in the required frequen-
cy band is insured. The effect of the reduction in the oscillations' amplitude
takes place in the band of frequencies from (1/031%)(l/T,) to a frequency that is
slightly lower than the platform's nutational frequency. Beginning with frequency
l/T', the forced oscillations' amplitude is reduced by a factor of ung, while on
frequency l/‘l‘m the maximum reduction, by a factor of «8Tﬁ(l/2£m), occurs. Figure 55

quency in the open state “2 be made lower than 1/15. In this case the technique for
selecting the stabilization circuit's structure and parameters described in Section
4.3 is used. In connection with this, instead of the platform's moment cf inertia,

in the calculations we should use its equivalent moment of inertia, as determined by
the relationship

IG-ﬂ=°’;T?nIm (5.49)

Since in this case it is as if the controlled object becomes more inertial, the
problem of constructing a stabilization circuit with an RVG is made easier. For the
same amplification factors in the stabilization circuit, there is a reduction in its
cutoff frequency in the open state, which lowers the requirements for the stabiliza-
tion circuit's elements. At the same time, because of the use of an NGS. the closed
system's band of working frequencies in which there is a reduction in the amplitude

see the frequency characteristics of such a closed system when an OMG with VP is
used (curves 3 and 3'). Curve 3 corresponds to the case of the utilization in the
stabilization circuit of a correcting component with transfer function (4.26).

There is an entire class of GSP's in which DUS's are used as the basic sensitive el-
ements. DUS's with small kinetic moments are normally used for this purpose. The
basic shortcoming of such DUS's is their large systematic deflections, since Dus's
based on the traditional layout have, as a rule, an inadmissibly high threshold of
sensitivity. This flaw can be eliminated by the creation in such GSP's of a KU cir-
cuit utilizing highly sensitive measurers of absolute angular velocities, such as
RVG‘s. The structural diagram of such a system is derived easily from the structurc
al diagram depicted in Figure 51. In connection with this we will assume that the
direct feedback encompassing the gyroscope is ideal ("22(p) 8 -K22). From (5.23) it
follows that for sufficiently high values of K22, cross-control of the platform from
the KU circuit through the DOS is not effective, so we will assume that "21(9) - 0.
Considering the assumptions that have been made, the GSP's transfer function with

tem's cutoff frequency ”cp by a factor of 3-10 {12). In the absence of special cor-

ity of the elements in the stabilization system. Therefore, a decrease in Ki is
achieved by introducing in .egrat- ng-differentiating components without increasing

other hand, the presence on the platform of a DOS-based stabilization circuit lowers
the requirements for the RVG-based correction circuit in comparison with the case
where only the latter is used to solve the problem of platform stabilization. Actu-
ally. in order to obtain identical systematic deflections and dynamic errors, the
amplification factor of the circuit with the RVG and its pass band for a 65? based
on a DOS prove to be much smaller than for the case of a stabilized platform based
on an CMG with VP. When RVG's with a transfer function of the (1.109) type are
used as the KU circuit's sensitive elements, it is necessary that the frequency of
the RVG's nutational oscillations be considerably higher than the cutoff frequency
of the DOS-based open stabilization circuit. In this case all that was said above
remains true.

Reductions in the systematic deflections of a GSP with KU can be achieved by in-

creasing the amplification factor in the stabilization circuit or in the correction
circuit and simultaneously adding to these circuits a series-connected integrating-
differentiating component with appropriately chosen parameters. In connection with

this. the pass band of both the stabilization circuit and the correction circuit can
remain the same.

The examples of the structure of a K3 circuit for GSP's of different types that we
have discussed show that when the nu circuit has adequate filtering properties
(which can be provided by extremely simple correcting components), in it it is pos-
sible to realize high amplification factors. This makes it possible to reduce GSP
deflections almost to the leVel of the RVG's threshold of sensitivity.

Conclusion

Practical problems encountered in applied gyroscopy have made it necessary to place
on the agenda questions relating to the development of the theory of va's and sys-
tems utilizing them. The generalized model proposed in this book makes it possible
to evaluate the prospects for the use of various RVC layouts to solve different
technical problems. The use of operator methods simplified considerably the analy-
sis of the equations of motion and the obtaining in analytical form of the depend-
ences of an instrument's basic characteristics on its parameters. For OMG's and
DMG's these dependences are fully visible and can be used directly in the designing
of such instruments. when synthesizing the parameters of more complex RVG systems.
they remain the basis of the computational algorithms for computers.

One of the main goals of designers is to minimize instrument error under giVeu oper-
ating conditions. The dependences of M36 errors on different disturbing factors re-
lated to motion of the base, inaccuracy in instrument production, and special fea-
tures of instrument operation, as derived in this book, along with the dependences
of RVG characteristics on their parameters, make it possible to work cut a criterion

for selecting an instrument layout and making an optimum synthesis of its basic pa-
rameters.

The results of the theoretical investigations presented in this book make it possi-
sle to determine the possibility of creating KRVG‘s [expansion unknown] with the re-
quired technical characteristics. as well as to determine the requirements for pro-

duction accuracy and accuracy in the tuning of element, assemblies and an entire in-
strument as a whole.

The questions on the theory of GSP‘s based on RVG's that have been discussed in this
book make it possible, using simple engineering methods, to carry out a preliminary
select ion of the structure of stabilization and correction circuits and their param—
eters. The specific na ure of systems with RVG' 3 consists of the presence of har-
aonicc compone..ts in the eve signal and additional cross-couplings between the sta-
' -iizaticn channels. In this book we have made simple estimates of the effect of
these cross-couplings on the dynamics of a 65?. We have developed a technique for
1-1CW139 is trans: en: feedback that makes it possible to define the basic charac-
tist-c s of a 55? more accurately. allowing for the harmonic component in the RVG
' stabilization systems using an RVG in an additional deflect: on correc-
. we have obtained limitations on the parameters of the deflection cor-

cuit, the observance of which makes it possible to discuss it separately
frcn the stabil izatio.. circuit

This book can be regarded as one of the first steps in this direction. Beyond its
scope were such important questions as special features of the use of avc's in ISN's
and 150's. questions in the nonlinear theory of RVG's and stabilized platforms based
on RVG's, and many other. The solution of these problems. along with problems ema-
nating from the practical realization of RVG's with the desired technical characters
istics. will make it possible to create stabilization and navigation instruments and
systems distinguished by their high accuracy. small size and low cost.
