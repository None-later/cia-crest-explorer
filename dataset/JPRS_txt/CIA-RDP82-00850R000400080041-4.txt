ROLE OF CHEMICALS, ADDITIVES IN LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION
Bratislava AGROCHEHIA in Czech No 10, Oct 81 pp 281-284

[Article by Eng Jaroair Nevole, Czech Planning Commission, Prague: "Use of
Chemicals in Agriculture in Connection With Livestock Production in the Sixth
and Seventh Five-Year Plans"]

[Text] An evaluation of the development of agriculture during the Sixth Five-
Year Plan indicates that in spite of some positive aspects, such as further
deepening of the process of concentration and specialization, particularly in
livestock production, and a reinforcement of the production base with new equip-
ment and the construction of new facilities, objectives regarding the quantity
of agricultural output were not fully achieved, particularly as a result of
several climatically unfavorable years.

The Sixth Five-Year Plan target for gross agricultural output was 95.2 percent
fulfilled. that for gross crop output was 91.3 percent fulfilled, and that for
gross livestock production was 98.5 percent fulfilled. Nor was the budgeted
quantity of agricultural commodities for state stocks fully realized: there was
a shortfall of 1.6 percent. Nonetheless, gross agricultural output showed a

9 percent increase compared with the Fifth Five—Year Plan, with gross crop pro-
duction achieving a 6.7 percent increase and gross livestock production an 11
percent increase. Over the long term. livestock production is proving to be

an intensifying factor in agricultural production as a whole. This is shown by
the continual growth of its share of gross agricultural output, which was 52.5
percent for the Fourth Five-Year Plan and 56.8 percent for the Fifth Five-Year
Plan and increased further to 55.7 percent in the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

This trend results exclusively froa an increase in the output of slaughter hogs
and poultry. while in value terms, cattle production in maintaining essentially
the same share of gross agricultural output, the share of hog-raising products
increased froa 12.5 percent in 1966-1970 to 16.3 percent during the Sixth Five-
Year Plan, and the share of poultry products increased from 8.8 percent to 11
percent. It is characteristic that in the same period, the total output of
forage crops and root feed crops, i.e., the main cattle feeds, dropped in value
terms from 9.8 percent to 7.3 percent of gross agricultural output.

Long-term analysis indicates that a change in the structure of crop and live-
stock production has not yet become desirable. The branches of livestock pro-
duction which have the greatest requirements for concentrates are growing

steadily. and substantially faster than cattle production. This isalso indi-
cated by a more detailed evaluation of the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

Compared with 1975. by 1980 the density of cattle per 100 hectares had in-
creased 11.1 percent to 73.2 head, including 27.8 cows. In the sane period the
density of pigs per 100 hectares increased 19.6 percent to 163.2, and the
figure for poultry increased 19.2percent. with 977.6 fowl being raised per 100
hectares of arable land. Considerable success has been achieved in expanding
yields. Nationwide milk yields passed the figure of 3,000 liters for the first
time in the history of Czechoslovakia, reaching the figure of 3,086 liters, 10
percent higher than in 1975. Calf production per 100 cows increased 6.3 per-
cent to 98.5. In addition, a number of agricultural enterprises and entire
okreses have already considerably surpassed the level of 100 calves per 100 cows.
In pig production, the figure of 16.7 pigs per sow has been reached, represent-
ing an increase of 5.2 percent in the period under consideration. Egg yields
reached 228.3, an increase of 6.6.

The average annual output of slaughter cattle in the Sixth Five-Year Plan was
6.2 percent higher than in the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and milk output was 6.5
percent higher, while overall production of forage crops, calculated as hay.
increased Only 5.7 percent. The production of perennial forage crops on arable
land even showed a drop of 7.7 percent.

The highly one-sided orientation of the production of bulk feeds toward annual
forage crops in Czechoslovakia compared with selected Heat European countries is
shown by the following comparison, which gives the shares of annual and perennial
feed crops in total farm feedstuffs, calculated in starch units (as percentages,
for 1977-1978):

forage crops on arable lands, and root feed crops. In West Germany this fig-
ure is 68.1 percent, in France 57.8 percent, in Holland 65.6 percent. in
Belgium 58.8 percent. in England 76.6 percent, in Denmark 29.5 percent, and in
Czechoslovakia 65.1 percent.

In addition to problems of a quantitative nature in the production of bulk feeds,
problems of a qualitative character also persist. A high percentage of annual
forage crops is stored in the form of silage. but the chemical industry has not

2
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
yet managed to produce the required preservatives. Poreignpreparations, primarily
based on propionic acid, are all but inaccessible for reasons of foreign exchange,
and domestic preparations, primarily based on formic acid. are produced in quan-
tities which fall far short of meeting the requirements. Unquestionably there

is considerable potential for improving the quality of silage in the area of
silage technology itself. The negative effect of bad silage on the health of
animals is a well-known problem. Bad silage leads to a number of metabolic
disorders in milk cows, and consequently in calves, which decrease their live
weight at birth, increase their mortality rate and permanently lower their qual-
ity for further use. Thus mistakes are made not only in the procedures of breed-
ing and raising the calves, but especially in the nutrition of the cows, so that
disorders of the liver parenchyma are found at slaughter. Findings on the health
of animals and its disruption made at slaughter should be utilized in agricul-
tural enterprises to improve feed procedures.

An increase in the output of fodder crops must be achieved by means of a whole
complex of measures. The frequently-used approach of applying high doses of
nitrogen fertilizers produces a considerable increase in nonprotein nitrogen
compared with protein nitrogen in bulk feeds. Problems arise either in preser-
vation or in feeding. Elimination of 1 gram of excess nonprotein nitrogen in
feed requires a milk cow to expend 20 to 30 kilojoules of energy. i.e., 2 to 3
grams of starch. which thus cannot be used for milk production. Constant use of
chemical fertilizers also has certain negative effects on the mineral nutrition
of cattle as a result of changes in the mineral content of the soil and leads to
a number of undesirable consequences.

Problems of the quantity and quality of bulk feeds for cattle raising result in
an excessively high consumption of concentrates. For example. concentrates con-
sumption balance figures for the Sixth Five-Year Plan assumed that an average of
31 percent would be used for feeding cattle, while the actual figure was 38 per-
cent. The consumption of concentrates per unit increase in live weight of cat-
tle exceeds the balance standard by 15 to 31 percent, while the consumption for
milk production exceeds the standard by 3 to 13 percent. There are constant
shortcomings in the organization and technical standards of feeding. resulting
in decreases of 10 to 15 percent from optimal yields. For example, correct or-
ganization of the feeding of milk cows with the same varieties of feeds (of good
quality and not harmful to health, of course) could yield an additional 1.5 to 2
liters of milk per cow per day.

In sum. we may state that new views on the structure of cattle nourishment indi-
cate that there is an energy deficiency in feeds when the percentage of nonpro-
tein nitrogen is increased and when the acidity of feeds is high with inadequate
mineral nutrients. which has an entirely negative impact on the effect of feed
rations and the health of animals, and also. in a number of cases, on the qual-
ity of cattle products for further processing and human nutrition. The high
acidity of feeds has a direct connection with an imbalance among the various
components in milk. particularly minerals. which has unfavorable consequences
for further processing of the milk and for the quality of food products.

The average annual output of slaughter pigs was up 17.9 percent in the Sixth
Five-Year Plan compared with the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the output of slaughter

3
FOR OFI'TCIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

poultry was up 28.7 percent and that of eggs 9.8 percent, while the average
total annual domestic output of grains was up 8.1 percent. Even though we are
including the results of years with poor harvests. still a number of other fac-
tors also made themselves felt. Drops in our own output had to be mude up by
special imports. This meant that allocations of grain to the central feed
supply for the Sixth Five-Year Plan as a whole were almost 3-1/2 times the
planned value. The total quantity of grain resources from our own production
and import thus exceeded the level achieved in the Fifth Five-Year Plan by 16
percent. Total quantities of forage cake and livestock meals increased 17 per-
cent compared with the Fifth Five-Year Plan. At the same time, the output of
feed mixtures for the five—year plan as a whole was up 33 percent compared with
the previous five-year plan. Basically, we may now say that the production of
feed mixtures in Czechoslovakia is fully meeting the requirements of the social-
ist sector for hog and poultry raising, while in cattle raising it is doing a
great deal to make up the shortcomings of our own feed base, and so is acting
as an intensifying factor. Even though in 1980 the economic conditions for pro-
duction of slaughter hogs, poultry and eggs worsened somewhat, to the advantage
of cattle raising, the profitability is still so high and cattle-raisin; con-
ditions are such that they make it possible to increase output further. The
base is provided by the collective agricultural enterprises which have been
built, in which the process of industrializing the sector includes elements of
automation. However the risks involved in the production of cattle in large
numbers in limited space, when the animals are bred for high productivity and

a high level of feed utilization, are such that these cattle are practically
incapable of existing without the comprehensive use of chemicals and biologicals,
i.e., the use of a complete system of feed additives. In a situation where the
percentage of forage cake and livestock meal as primary protein components fell
from 14.1 percent in the Fifth Five-Year Plan to an average of 12.2 percent in
the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it was only the extent of use of chemicals that en-
abled the livestock production results described above to be achieved. How-
ever. it is a fact that as prices have continued to rise on world markets, a
shortage of foreign-exchange credits for the purchase of feed additives has
made it impossible to use the optimal amounts of additives in feed mixtures.
For example, the prices of most feed additives have increased approximately
twofold in the past 5 years.

The increase in prices of selected feeds is shown by the following data (in per-
centages of the 1970 figures):

1975 1980
Corn 198 233
Soy cake 150 290
Fish meal 124 256

Tne increasing dependency of livestock production on imports of critical com-
pcnents of feed mixtures is highly risky in terms of trade policy, because it
m.kes meat production dependent on foreign deliveries.

There are also problems in domestic production, particularly in the provision of
certain minerals and especially phosphorus.

For the Sixth Five—Year Plan as a whole, while there was a considerable increase
in the output of feed mixtures, it was not possible to assure that they had the
required biological quality in terms of quantities of vitamins. main amino acids,
minerals, effectiveprotective substances and chemical and biological growth
stimulators, even though it has been shown that introduction of chemicals into
animal nutrition does the following:

--improves the biological quality of their nutrition, thus increasing the ani—
mals' resistance to stall diseases, infection and stress in handling;

—-decreases losses from poor care forced slaughter and lowerea vitality;

--affects the degree of feed utilization (in case of a considerable deficiency
of the main vitamins, amino acids and minerals, fodder use increases up to 25
percent);

--increasea the biological value of the final animal product, thus favorably
affecting the quality offoodstuffs and the health of consumers.

A long-term evaluation of agricultural production trends indicates that while be—
fore the socialist reconstruction of the countryside production was carried on
with a considerably lower degree of dependence on the other branches of the
national economy, today, with the use of scientific and technical knowledge,

the percentage of the means of production supplied to agriculture by other sec-
tors of the national economy is increasing considerably. In foodstuff produc-
tion, close connections are growing up between agriculture, the foodstuff and
feeds industries, and the chemical, machine-building, fuels and energy and
pharmaceuticals sectors. It is estimated that the chemical industry accounts

for almost 15 percent of the final value of agricultural and foodstuff products,
the feeds industry for 3 percent, agriculture itself for only 45.5 percent, the
foods industry for 16 percent and so on. The consequence of this situation is
that the responsibility of a much wider range of production sectors for foodstuff
production is increasing. He must work systematically to assure proportionality
among all sectors and branches and proper intersectorisl relations. This is also
true of sectors whose inputs into the agricultural-foods complex are quantita-
tively small but qualitatively irreplaceable.

In this connection, at the end of last year a basic set of documents entitled

“A Program for the Use of Biochemicals and Chemicals in Agricultural Production
During the Seventh Five-Year Plan" was compiled and approved by the CSSR Govern-
ment Presidium. It stresses the high requirements which modern large-scale
socialist livestock production has for biochemical and chemical preparations,
which are indispensable both nutritionally and from the veterinary point of
view. A deficiency of these specific substances, particularly health-protection
substances, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, growth stisulatore and the like,
will result in great losses from poor care or necessary slaughter of both cattle
and pigs, compared with the optimal possibilities. The incomplete biological
value of feed mixtures also leads to a lower level of utilization of the feeds
and to a decrease in the average daily weight gain, with a prolongation of the
feed cycle. The program for use of blochemicals and chemicals in livestock

production during the Seventh Five-Year Plan does not aim at solving the entire
problem. but at finding ways to supply the most important preparations from
domestic production by the end of the Seventh Five-Year Plan and the beginning
of the Eighth. This involves especially tylosin, a specific antibiotic for
large-scale livestock raising, coccidiostat, growth stimulators. important
vitamins, expanded production in lysine. domestic production of dicalcium phos-
phate, and a changeover in production of biological factors and medicated feed
preparations to the production of euperconcentrstes, which ultimately are turned
out in premixed form by the feed industry. One new material is Oestrophan, a
domestically-produced preparation used to control the reproduction of cows and
heifers which can also be used in hog and sheep raising. This is an extremely
demanding program in which all relevant sectors should take an active part. in-
cluding direct cooperation by the scientific research base.

According to the program for the use of chemicals and biochemicals in livestock
production, theproblem presented by the other chemical and biological substances
delivered to agriculture. which all have a greater or lesser effect on livestock
production, the health of animals. the quality of livestock products. and the
entire environment is an increasingly important central concern. This especially
involves chemical fertilizers, whose increased effectiveness requires not only
further increases in the concentration of nutrients and an improvement of

their physical properties, but also their use under scientific conditions and

a considerable decrease in losses during storage and application.

The article “Self-Sufficiency in the Production of Foods for Efficient Nutrition"
by Academician K. Kudrna (VESHIR. March 1981) stresses that a basic condition for
the operation of the entire agricultural system is the return of high-quality
organic fertilizers to the soil. The article refers to the future necessity of
so-called “waste-free" technological systems in agriculture. which among other
things would decrease the negative effect of the current agricultural system on
the environment. One of the preconditions for redressing the balance between
energy applied from fossil sources and energy obtained from solar radiation is
that of assuring the effectiveness of mineral fertilisers. One requirement is
that of returning organic matter to the soil. so as to increase the content of
high-molecular-weight humus compounds. which are essential for the development
of microbial communities, and thus are a prerequisite for passage of the ions
liberated from mineral salts into the underground organs of plants.

Increased fodder output cannot be achieved solely by increasing applications of
mineral fertilizers, but also requires full and effective utilization of organic
material from livestock production.

with regard to the hitherto frequency negative effect which the application of
chemical pesticides has on the wholesomenesa of feeds. and. via residues, on the
quality of livestock products as well, Academician Kudrna also states that one
important contribution which science makes to self-sufficiency will be findings
which help us to change from a strategy of chemical protection of field crops

to biological protection and to the possibility of decreasing the quantities of
harmful substances. Integrated protection of field crops offers considerable
possibilities for limiting the negative effects of chemical residues on the
environment and human life. As a specific application. we may mention the con-
clusions of Docent Dr K. Blahy in his article "Use of Chemicals in Biology

6
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

and of Biologicals in Chemistry" (VESHIR, March 1981), which states that juve—
noids and pheromones, substances which are capable of influencing the develop-
ment and communication of insects, deserve attention as promising substances
which may be used as modern means of struggle against insects as part of inte-
grated crop protection. This could be one of the greatest contributions of
organic chemistry both to assuring the nourishment of the populace and to pro—
tecting the environment. At the same time, it might restore the none—too-good
reputation of organic chemistry as the producer of the classical insecticides,
which were only temporarily successful.

In dealing with the development of the agricultural-foodstuffs complex, the
document "Main Directions of the Economic and Social Development of Czechoslo-
vakia During 1981-1985," approved by the 16th CPCZ congress. accords top prior-
ity to expanding livestock production in keeping with actual feed supplies.

The increase in output is to he achieved primarily by expanding cattle produc-
tion, with an increase in the productivity of the animals. The expansion of
types of production which have high requirements for concentrates is to be ac-
cosmndsted only to supply capabilities. By using knowledge about scientifically
managedlivestock nourishment. a higher degree of utilization of our fodder pro-
duction than the current 10 to 15 percent is to be attained. The protein pro-
gram which was adopted is to be carried out, and the program of use of biochem-
icals in livestock production is to be implemented gradually.

The basic goal is to maintain the previous meat consumption level of about 85
kilograms per capita and to meet the requirements of increasing population by
increased output. The main task is to achieve structural changes. In accord-
ance with the principles contained in the Main Directions. the draft Seventh
Five-Year Plan expects a constant level or only a slight increase in the output
of slaughter hogs and poultry. In contrast, it plans on an increase of 10.3 per-
cent in the production of slaughter cattle and an increase of 6.2 percent in
silk production over the 1980 level.

These basic structural tendencies mean that it will be necessary to round out
the use of chemicals in pig and poultry raising in order gradually to reach the
optimal level. In accomplishing the task of considerably increasing the output
of cattle, and particularly slaughter cattle, it will be necessary to direct
primary attention to methods and forms of the use of chemicals in this sector.
In pig and poultry raising, the administration of additives is carried out pri-
marily through enrichment of feed mixtures, which are the only feed used in
large-scale production. The work will be more complex in cattle raising, be-
cause it will be necessary in particular to solve the problems associated with
the health of the animals, which will require extensive cooperation with the

veterinary service.

The use of chemicals in cattle raising must be accomplished primarily by means
of centers for controlled cattle feeding and by active measures directed at

crop production. Close cooperation with the agrochemical enterprises will help
in finding ways of working together to keep the application of agrochemicals from
degrading the quality and wholesomeneaa of bulk feeds. Working together with the
scientific research base, it will be necessary to find new forms of agricultural
protection which limit residues. The agrochemical problems in crop production
cannot be separated from their possible effects on livestock production.

It is especially necessary to appreciate the qualitative change that has

taken place in the quantities of chemical fertilizers used, particularly in

the last 10 years. An increase in average concentration from 28 to 34 percent,
an increase in the share of multicomponent fertilizers from 13 to 34

percent, and an increase in the share of granulated fertilizers from 37 to 62
percent in the period between 1970 and 1980 represent a truly fundatental change
in the selection. which was foatered by innovations in domestic production
rather than by effects produced on trade policy by the imported proportion of
industrial fertilizers. The SbR continues to move in the directions described,
for it increased the lead which it had already gained by 1970, making a jump
from 28 to 42 percent in the concentration of fertilizers produced (the national
average increased from 24 to 35 percent), from 33 to 54 percent in the percent»
age of multicomponent fertilizers (the national average increased from 23 to 44
percent) and from 53 to 79 percent in the percentage of granulated fertilizers
(the national average increased from 50 to 70 percent). That this involved con
siderable new capacities in the SSR's chemical industry (enterprises of VHJ
Slovchemia) is also attested by the increase in the SSR's share of nationwide
output from 39.4 to 54 percent duringthatperiod, with the growth rate in the
SSR reaching 235 percent compared with a national growth rate of 171 percent
(and a rate of only 130 percent in the 058).

The Sixth Five-Year Plan can be called the initial period of deliveries of
liquid fertilizers. with the exception of ammonia for direct application, which
already had a tradition of more than 10 years' standing by 1970; but its con-
sumption has remained at the level of 3,000-4,000 tons of nitrogen a year, and
shows a tendency to drop rather than to progress. The 2.2 percent share of
nutrients accounted for by liquid fertilizers in 1980 is not a surprise, but
for nitrogen fertilizers the figure is already 4.8 percent, and in terms of

its prospects, a situation in which the chemical industry's production capac-
ities are ahead of agriculture's ability to use them has developed. This
disproportion is likely to increase until 1985.

The overall level of consumption of agricultural fertilizers in 1980 and their
selection and quality indicators were critical in bringing about a change in the
ratios of nutrients used, which occurred especially at the end of the Sixth
Five-Year Plan, involving a drop in the percentage of potassium. The trend is
clear from the table showing proportions of nutrients and from the graph of
nutrient consumption. Nitrogen, the most extensively used fertilizer through-
out the world, surpassed P205 in Czechoslovakia in 1968, but the consumption of
K20 still exceeded the consumption of nitrogen in 1979. although by only less
than half a percentage point. In 1980, however, the consumption of K20 is only
84 percent of the consumption of nitrogen for Czechoslovakia as a whole and 88
percent for Slovakia.

That this is a long-term, regular development is confirmed by the fact that
there was a drop not only in the relative consumption of K20 but also in the
absolute quantities of potassium nutrients consumed, culminating in 1975 with

a consumption of 669,000 tons of K20; the figure jumped again in 1978 to 663,000
tons of K20, but reached only 569,000 tons in 1980, the same level as in 1972-
1974. The rate of increase of nitrogen consumption in the decade 1970-1930 was
almost 170 percent. and the increase in consumption of P205 was 150 percent,

but the increase in the consumption of K20 was less than 116 percent. The SSR
achieved a higher rate of growth than the national average (by 5 percent over-
all). particularly in nitrogen. In this connection, we may also note the abso-
lute increase in consumption of nutrients in chemical fertilizers in the 1970-
1980 period in comparison with the 1960-1970 period (see the right side of the
consumption graph). The increases in use of nitrogen in the CSR and of P205 in
both the CSR and SSR were almost as high in 1970-1980 as in 1960-1970 (the
rates of growth in that decade were 220 and 280 percent), while the increase in
use of nitrogen in the SSR was even higher (104,000 tons compared with 78,000
tons), and the increase in the use of K20 dropped to a third ($83) and a fourth
(CSR) of the growth rate in 1960-1970.

In terns of the intensity of use of industrial fertilizers, the Heat Slovak [raj
continues to be the leader, with a level of approxiaately 125 percent of the
national average. The lowest average nutrient applications per hectare of agri-
cultural land are in the Central Slovak Kraj, where the figure ranges from 65 to
77 percent of the national average. When the consuaption of cheaical fertili-
zers is calculated per unit of arable land and leadowland, the Heat Slovak [raj
remains in first place, but the South Bohelian Kraj loves into last place, and
the CSR as a whole has only 94 percent of the national average for this indica-
tor. The lowest ration of P205 to nitrogen is in the South Moravian Kraj,

while the greatest drop is shown by the Central Slovak Kraj, from 1.28 in 1960
to 0.71 in 1980. The smallest drop during this period is shown by the Best Slo-
vak Kraj. which along with the Central Bohemian Kraj had the lowest level in
1960, while in 1980 it was in first place with a ratio of 0.80,ahead of the North
Moravian Kraj. The lowest ratio of K10 to nitrogen was posted by the Heat Bohe-
aian Krajs, while the greatest drop was posted by the north Bohemian Kraj, where
the ratio of 0.67 in 1980 was only 47.5 percent of the 1960 figure. The great-
est stability is shown by the Central Bohemian Kraj, where the ratio in 1980
exceeded 63 percent of the value in 1960, while the kraj sowed froa eighth place
in 1960 to second place, behind only the Heat Slovak Kraj, in 1980. The latter
kraj continues to have the highest ratio of K20 to nitrogen.

REPORT ON INTERVIEW WITH ECONOHISTS
PN240921 Turin LA STAHPA in Italian 22 Sep 81 p 3

[Report on interview with Jozsef Bogner by Frans Barbieri: 'iungary, Like an
Eastern Bloc Switzerland")

[Excerpt] The Polish crisis is, to some extent. everybody's crisis. Moscow
is afraid that Poland might break loose from the Soviet zone. and the other
socialist governments fear Polish contagion. All have economies in precarious
states in dormant societies. A Polish-type explosion is to be expected from
the combination of the two negative factors. The only country which does not
feel a similar danger, at least in the short term, is Hungary. In Budapest
they are not enthusiastic about Halesa but neither do they fear contagion.

Stability

He had the opportunity to discuss this phenomenon with two leading figures who
have come from Budapest to take part in one of the edifying conventions on

the Eastern Bloc economies organized by the socioeconomic problems studies

and research center. In a sense they are two architects of the individual
Hungarian model. The first is Rezso Nyers, former [HSZHP Central Committee]
Politburo uwrber who is regarded as "the father of the reform" and who was
transferred to the post of head of the economics institute a few years ago
(apparently because of excessively liberal ideas), but is still a Central
Committee member and close to Radar.

The second is Jozsef Bognar. chairman of the Academy of Sciences Economics
Section [as published] who is also one of the party secretary's advisers.

He began the conversation by pointing out: '30th of the two Europes seen

to have their own Switzerland. The only socialist country which boasts the
absence of an economic crisis is ﬂungary. We know the reasons for Switzerland's
stability. However, we find it more difficult to establish how Hungary has
succeeded in becoming the East's Switzerland."

Professor Bognar was first to reply: "I would not say it was exactly a
Switzerland. The Hungarian economy has serious problems too. He must restore
the economic balance, above all the balance of payments. We are affected by
the world crisis and are importing inflation. If there is an impression that

13

our country has a stable economy, it is due to the maturity which the Hungarians
have shown in assessing the situation. The most positive aspect to which the
stability and containment of the crisis is due is the fact that we can implement
our economic policy and introduce reforms in conditions of national calm."

Then came Hyers' turn: "In our country there is no crisis situation; we are
living in sound political and economic conditions. However, I think the
comparison with Switzerland is risky because we are facing more serious

problems. But I think the main reason why we can boast a strong situation is

as follows: the party has succeeded in drawing together the real dimensions of
the situation and is not leaving economic development simply to economic forces--
in other words it is able to take advantage of the means which planning can offer
but. in addition, it does not have any fanatical belief in the whole series of
tools of the planned economy but takes into consideration and stimulates individual
and original initiatives. In Hungary we have succeeded in harmonizing the class
policy with the nation’s interests. However, we are now facing a problem: the
vitality of socialist democracy is inadequate. Political planning of economic
processes should be taken to a higher and more coordinated level. This must be
done to avoid reaching a critical situation in the future without foreseeing it."

Emergency

He pointed out: "Caution, based on bitter experience. makes the Hungarians avoid
comparisons. However, it is necessary to point out that in the building of the
Hungarian model trade and finance, in other words the market, have been dis-
covered as a component and lover in a socialist economy. In the other countries
either these factors are not recognized or they are considered to be secondary
compared with the inflexible myth surrounding production. If the market is
accepted in those countries it is treated as something to be suffered and
suppressed as soon as possible. since it is an element which is foreign to
socialism. The Hungarians, however, talk of the market not as a capitalist or
socialist factor but as a test of the ability to runtheeconomy: somebody who
is unable to run the market ends to suppress it. From this viewpoint, is the
Hungarian model a mixed, crisis concept or an integral, definitive concept or

a new socialist economy?

Nyers replied: "In designing our model we were helped by the crisis. It was
the crisis which led us to discover the new possibilities and the need to
design a model. The crisis was the tragic events of 1956. In the model we

do not consider the market as a transitory thing to be transcended in future
development but as a permanent factor. The market is an organic part of our
model. just as planning is. They are part of a single concept. We think that.
without the discovery of the way in which the market works. even planning could
not be effective."

We objected: "We have often heard you invoke the so-called 'New Economic
Policy' [HEP] formulated by Lenin. But in the USSR the HEP was a makeshift
solution immediately absorbed by the existing systen. The fact remains that
no other socialist country has tried to implement it. Officially, in Moscow
the HEP is still considered a weakening of socialism. Only in your country does
it seem to adopt general aspects and a more than temporary value."

Nyers said: 'This Leninist theory of the HEP is indeed regarded as a backward
step from the building of a socialist economy. Nevertheless, the NE? can also
be considered a theory that provides the general outlines of an economic model.
Those, like us, who believe in a reform accept it in this latter interpretation,
namely the idea that the NSF is a general and permanent guideline."

Bognar said: "I am of the opinion that we must examine the real relationships
in a society in its various new and real elements and not always invoke them
classics. In our analysis of the real situation we have realized that the
market, the relationship between goods and money, plays a very important role.
Consequently, we are trying to extend it instead of reducing it. I mean the
world market too. There were many people who supported the theory that the
socialist countries would not suffer the effects of the crisis of capitalism.
When we are obliged to purchase something at a higher price on the world market
we, too, are in the position of suffering the effects of the world crisis. This
means that these influences are also present in the Hungarian economy to a more
or less accentuated extent, depending on how far we manage to control them. But
1 must say that, despite the negative trends, the<world market has played an

important role in the development of the socialist economy, and that it has made
it progress."

He put forward another objection: “In the Hungarian reforms the economic aspect
seems to have been stressed and the political and social aspects overlooked. How
then is it possible to explain a certain absence of civil and social conflicts

in the country-the kind of tolerant patience or almost national silence con-
cerning official policy."

Nyers replied: "I would like to say at once that as far as the development of
political relations is concerned-~and here I mean the consensus, the relations
of trust between the government leadership and the masses--this development
preceded the economic reform, following the 1956 events. However, before 1968
participation in the management of enterprises was very limited. Then there
was a major step forward. Now, however, it is also true that the demands for

a further political development are becoming greater and greater, since economic
development has overtaken political development. Though I must say that the
economic reform has not been apolitical."

Culture

He pointed out that "all this does not explain the absence of any real dissidence
and the absence of cultural conflict in Hungary. Following the 1956 trauma

the Hungarian people, of all tthastern Bloc countries, have created the fewest
difficulties for their own government-oand not as result of authoritarian pressure."

Bognar said: "The country's political leadership has agreed in its assessment
that its position would be strengthened if it could create a successful economic
system. The reform has facilitated the expression of various interests in the
economic field. Various social groups and various economic sectors compete

within the framework of the system and seek to express themselves as best

they can. These are the intentions of the second period of reform, started

in 1978. At the outset in 1968 the reform was prevalently economic: a broader
reform embracing the political structures would have achieved lesser results
since this requires a unitary stance and broad support from the population."

He objected that the reason for this is not very clear. Bognar replied: "It
was because at that moment it was impossible to foresee only favorable reper-
cussions on the international plane."

We interpret his reply as a reference to possible Soviet pressures (which were
in fact felt at one stage) which would have impeded or hindered the course

of the reform. He also observe that it is still impossible to see clearly

the attitude of the cultural sphere toward a reform so exclusively based on
the economy as to seem almost mechanical.

Bognar explained: "Culture is a different system of values. At the outset

we were convinced that the writers were on our side. They wanted more freedom
in literature and wanted more in the economy. He did not think that the
economy did not come first in their scale of values. Following the reform

we had polemice with several writers. The polemics are still not over: there
is still extensive elucidation work to be done for the world of culture to be
able to accept a program centered on the economy."

We asked: "In view of the new political and cultural demands that you are
talking about, what are the plans of the new reform phase?

Conflicts

Bognar replied first: 'Wow we must tackle the issue of the restriction of the
state's powers. Not in the sense that the state must renounce all its pre-
rogatives, but in the sense that we have discovered that the state cannot be
the source of prosperity. The state cannot do and guarantee everything. We
must put society in a position to sustain its own conflicts. Centralized
government is unsuitable for resolving these conflicts inasmuch as it
eventually centralized them too. Hitherto unrest in the student canteens

has been dealt with by the Central Committee. A way must be found of resolving
the conflicts within the context in which they emerge. He must increase the
tolerance of disputes."

Nyers added: “An economic policy that fails to take account of the cultural
aspects cannot succeed. In a contemporary socialist society action carried out
within society must be due not so much to the state but rather to individual
groups. Often this activity must be assisted and stimulated by the state, and
the politician must recognize that we human beings—and not the state--are the
source of happiness."

He tried to specify the nature of the Hungarian nodel: "There is the formula
of bureaucratic socialism (the Soviet kind) and there is the fornula of

self-managed socialise (the Yugoslav‘kind): Can the Hungarian formula be
described as entrepreneurial socialism?"

Nyers replied: "I do not agree. Ours is s socialism of the workers, of

the enterpreneurs and of the political protagonists. Also of a patient people,
with a tragic experimce behind then."

Bogner added: "In our Iodel the entrepreneur has an ilportant role but he
is not an entrepreneur on his own account. He must ensure the success of social
economic activity to emble the worker to have lore."
