[Interview with A. H. Vagidov, director of the Dagestan Book Publishing House,
by A. Nikishin, DRUZHBA NARODOV correspondent: date and place not specified]

[Text] [Question] Abdulla Hagomedovich, how did Dagknigizdat begin?

[Answer] In accordance with a decision by the Military Council for the Defense
of Dagestan, in January 1921, in the city of Temir-Khan-Shure, a press depart-
ment was created at the People's Commissariat of Education and was given the
functions of a publishing house: the publication of newspapers, periodicals,
books. posters, and leaflets. Dagestan is a multinational republic with the
representatives of 36 indigenous peoples and ethnic groups living here. Before
the revolution many of them did not have their own writing. The works of the
great poets of Dagestan Yetim Emin, Ircha Kazak. Batyray, and Hakhnud existed
only in oral renditions. Very few books were published. In 1916 the Dagestan
publisher Havrayev issued 16 books in the Farsi and Arabic languages. of them,
only seven were for reading. and these were on religious topics. And tne press
section was given the task of providing the peoples of Dagestan with books in
their native languages. . . .

[Question] Sixty years of the publishing house and 60 years of the USSR. How
are these anniversaries connected for you?

[Answer] From the very first day our publishing house has waged a struggle

for the new man. its first publications were leaflets calling upon the popu-
lation to fight Vrangel and the nationalistic bands of Gotsinskiy. Leaflets
devoted to the starving Volga Region, the periodical BRATSKAYA POHOSHCH', the
newspaper DAGBSTAN--POVOLZH'YU in the Russian language and the newspaper

NA POHOSHCH'! in the Kumyk, Avar,and Lak languages came out in mass editions.
ln I921 the periodical IZVBSTIYA was published--the organ of the party obkom,
only nine issues each consisting of l and k to 2 pages. .Fron its pages there
sounded calls to struggle against illiteracy, and this struggle was taking place
in Dagestan everywhere. The mountain auls became the destination of 17,000 cul-
tural army men--with Russians and Ossetes and Adyges among them. They brought
the mountaineers the first textbooks which had been published by the press dc-
partment. Not everywhere were the cultural army men net with joy-afraid of
losing their influence on believers, clergyman called upon them to expel the

1h
moma'tmaomv-
"infidels." Atheistic literature was of enormous importance in those years;

it helped to fight against the church and its servants. Among.the publi-
cations of that time were "The Origin of Islam and Its Class Role" and "Religion
and Women." The first artistic works by the writer Nurov "Ayshat in the Claws
of the Adat" and "Batyray" struggled against the traditions which were standing
in the wayof the new life, and called for the liberation of women from their
age-old bondage. Afterwards books appeared which have now already become biblio-
graphical rarities: "The Attempt on V. I. Lenin" by Bonch-Bruyevich, "Conversa-
tions About Communism" and "The ABC of Leninism" by Kaprinskiy, "Lenin and the
Liberation of Women" by Klara Tsetkin, and "Revolution and Counter-Revolution"
and "Ullubiy Buynakskiy" by Takho-Godi. In 1921 around 100 book titles were

published consisting of 3,388 printed pages and in an edition of 1 million
copies.

The country was building, and the age-old way of life was changing. In the
l930's the constitutions of the USSR, RSFSR, and DaSSR were published in mass
editions in the languages of Dagestan. During those years the collectivization
of the village had begun, and the press department (in 1931 it received the
name of book publishing house) did not remain aloof from this very important
topic of the day. Books on agriculture issued by the publishing house helped
the peasants to assimilate the advanced experience of the country's best farms,
and described new and progressive methods of soil cultivation and crop raising.

[Question] what event in the history of the publishing house is most memorable
for you?

[Answer] I would say the Ten Days of the Art and Literature of Dagestan in
Moscow in [960. An exhibition of our books was opened there: the works of
Marx, Engels, and Lenin in the Avar, Dargva, Kumyk, Tabasaran, Lezgi, and Lak
languages which before the revolution did not have their own alphabets. He
exhibited 180 collections of Dagestan poetry--books by Hakhmud, Ircha Kazak,
thin Emin, Baryray, Cahnka, Camzat Tsadasa, Suleyman Stal'skiy, Rasul Gamzatov,
Cafurov, Cadzhivey, Kaziyau Alya, Khuryugskiy, and Khappalayev. In 1953 our
publishing house issued the first novels in the Kumyk language--"Makhach" by
lbragim Kerimov. In later years Dagestan prose was enriched by the remarkable
works of Effendya Kapiyev, Yusup Gereyev, Kiyas Hedzhidonov, and H. S.
Yakh'yayev, and new novels also came out--"Revenge" by M. Hagomedov, "Fires"

by H. Sulimanov, and "The Break" by I. Kerimov. The first collections of fairy
tales on the Avar, Dargva,Lezgi, Kumyk, and Lak languages were also represented

at the exhibition. In the comment book people wrote rapturously about "Dagestan,
reborn through revolution."

[Question] Abdulla Hagomedovich, how is the collective of your publishing house
celebrating the 60th anniversary of the formation of the USSR?

[Answer] He have timed the publication of new books to this glorious date for
our country among which are "In the Constellation of Fraternal Republics”

(compiler--R. l. Dzhambulatova) and "Strong in Friendship" (author-Bogautdin
Akhmcdov). Our previously backward outlying district of Russia has'now become

15

a very rich region of developed industry. To a considerable extent this was
fostered by the help of the fraternal peoples of the USSR. At one time the
petroleum workers of Checheno—Ingushetiya and Azerbaijan helped us to create

a petroleum industry; Astrakhan' fishermen helped us to exploit the fish stocks
of the Caspian; and Moscow and lvanov weavers taught us to master complex tex-
tile equipment. Today there are things that can be learned from us! In our
republic there are 183 large enterprises, and their output is exported to such
highly developed countries as Japan, France, and England. The successes of

one of the largest enterprises of the Caucasus--the plant imeni Gadzhiyev-—are
described in the eloquent publication of C. Kima and Ya. Suleymanov "My
Plant--My Fate" which we are devoting to the holiday.

Gigantic changes have occurred during the years of Soviet power in the cultural
life of Dagestan. The enormous additions of books by Suleyman Stal'skiy and
Camzat Tsadasa are soldout literally in an instant. The memory of those Russian
Soviet writers who have made a contribution to the development of Dagestan
literature has been made eternal in our republic: N. Tikhonov, P. Pavlenko,
and v. Lugovskoy. There are 826 libraries in the republic with a total fund

of 8 million volumes. The happy fate of the peoples of Dagestan is reflected
upon in the book "I Glorify the Fatherland That Is" by the People's Poet of
Dagestan Fazu Aliyeva, the rector of Dagestan State University imeni Lenin
Abutallb Abilov, the People's Artist of the RSFSR and Chairman of the Dagestan
branch of the All-Union Theatrical Society Gamid Rustamov, and the Hero of
Socialist Labor, the team leader at "Chirkeygesstroy" Sapiyula Hagomedov.

A book by A. T. Puterbrot "The Combat Glory of Dagestan" tells about our
countrymen, Heroes of the Soviet Union, those who created glory for the land
of Dagestan during the grave years of the Great Patriotic War.

Every year our publishing house issues books, literary periodicals, and almanacs
in the 6-7 languages of the peoples of Dagestan. Twice a year a collection

of Tabasaran poetry is published, the almanac "Literary Tahasaran," in which

the best works of prose and poetry in that language are represented. Bvery
quarter the almanac "Friendship" and the periodical SOKOLBNOK are published

in the Lak, Avar, Kumyk, Lezgi, and Dargva languages. Every year the almanac

- "Native Land" which consists of six printed sheets and in which the works of

Nogay writers are represented, and the almanac "Soviet Homeland” in the Tat
language a re published .

Our publishing house gives a great deal of attention to translations of the

best works of Soviet literature into the languages of the peoples of Dagestan.
In I981 the collection of stories by N. Tikhonov "The heart of the Mountains“
and the "Poem of Farewell" by A. Sofronov were published in the Aver language.
We are publishing in a translation into the Dargba language the poem by the
people's poet of Dagestan Rasul Gamzatov "The Tale of Khochbar" which is devoted
to the folk hero of the mountaineers Khochbar who fought against the Khans and
the neks. And his famous work "My Dagestan" has been translated into the Kumyk

language. The people's poet of Dagestan R. Rashidov has translated the poetry
of the Lak poet Nuratdin Yusupov into the Dargva language.

The Russian language plays a large role as a means of inter-national communication
in the life of'our peoples and in the establishment and development of the litera-
ture of the republic.

Last year we published the third volume of "An Anthology of Dagestan Poetry"
and the novel by F. H. Dostoevsky "The Idiot" in the Russian language. Three'
interesting books have come out in the "Criticism and Literary Studies" section:
"Fidelity to Talent" by R. Gamzatov—-critical and journalistic articles written
in recent years have gone into the new book of the famous and beloved poet;
"Russian-Dagestan Literary Relations"-—in this book the author 0. Khanmurzayev
studies the topic of the Caucases in the works of Chernyshevskiy, Dobrolyubov,‘
Dostoevsky. and Tolstoy; and the book by G. Sultanova “Dagestani Revolutionary
Dramaturgy"--the 60 year development of Dagestani dramaturgy is generalized

in this book.

In the "prose" section a book by H. G. Pashayev "Lak Folk Tales" has been
published in the Russian language. Children's literature occupies a special

and honored place with us. The first works for children which have come out

in the republic belong to the pen of the people's poet of Dagestan Gamzat Tsadasa.
His amazing fairy tale "The Rabbit and the Lion" has been translated into all

of the languages of Dagestan. In all, in recent years our publishing house

has published more than 50 children's books.

A book of poems by the well—known Soviet poet and translator Yakov Kozlovskiy
has been released in the "poetry" section. Next year tales by the wellnknown
Dagestani prose writer Abu-Bakar, and a collection of novellas by the Tat writer
Kh. Avshalumov "The Sly Shimi Derbendi" will be published in translations into
Russian.

The demand for good books is constantly growing. In 1981 the publishing house
put out 193 book and periodical titles with a total edition of around 1 million
copies, but the wishes of the Book Trading Organization and of readers have
been far from fully satisfied.

'IQuestion] And what is the reason for that?

[Answer] First of all, we did not fulfill last year's plan for titles. What
had been planned was 254 titles consisting of lO,l88 printed sheets. During

the first half year we had counted on publishing lol titles, but only 80 were
published. During the third quarter, instead of 96 titles, only 60 were pub-
lished. In August 1981 a conference was held at which representatives of the
republic' 3 State Committee for Publishing and of our base printing house imeni
S. M. Kirov were present. They assured the RSFSR State Committee for Publishing
that before the end of the year the printing house would meet its commitments
and produce output with a total volume of 1,950,000 sheets. By the 2nd of
November the printing house "had left" 71 titles with a total volume of 1,345,000
printed sheets. The printing house proved to be incapable of performing such

3 volume, and it was necessary to request of the RSFSR State Committee for
Publishing that 80 titles be put over until the following year. Permission

17
FOIIOFFICIAl.lEH!(HVLY
IKHICIHGCLALIﬁ§E(HVLY

was not given to us. Be that as it may, on account of the unrhythmic work of
our base printing house, where on account of labor turnover there is a constant
shortage of workers, 30 book titles remained unpublished. We are not happy
about the quality of the output and about the production schedules. For example,
the publishing house was preparing a book to mark the anniversary of the well-
known Kumyk poet A. V. Suleymanov. He submitted it to the typesetters in early
December 1979, and received it in December l980-exactly one year later! On
account of the poor work done by the printing house the publication schedule

for the periodical SOKOLENOK is not met. The periodical comes late to subscribers,
and the quality of the printing is also not gratifying. Compared to 1975, we
have curtailed our amount of output by 2 million printed sheets. In view of

the situation, we are seeking help outside-we print books in Haykop,
Mineral'nyye Vody, Blektrostak', and Kaspiysk. And here are the results: Last
year profits from book sales came to 800,000 rubles, while losses were 300,000
rubles greater than this.

The publishing house is struggling for high quality in its books. The manuscripts
which come in to the Dagestan Book Publishing House are carefully reviewed,

and the very best works are selected. We give serious attention to the design

of the book. He enlist the republic's best artists. Artists of the older genera—
tion have made a large contribution to the creation of our books-the Honored

Art Worker of the DaSSR D. Kapanitsyn, the Honored Art Worker of the RSFSR

M. A. Dzhemal, the People's Artist of the DaSSR Yu. Moldayev, and the Honored
Artist of the RSPSR A. Clukhovtsev; their best traditions are being added to

by the Honored Artist of the RSPSR S. Salavatov, and the artists L. Bruzgin,

S. Hagomedov, and F. Dzhanakhay. The publishing house's artistic editors Ye.
Omel'chenko and V. Logachev give much of their strength and energy to designing
our books.

But what kind of qualitative work is it possible to speak about if the printing
house regularly does not fulfill the contract commitments, and if 62 of the
publishing house's workers have been finding refuge for the sixth year now in
100 square meters in a semi-collapsedone-story house without the elementary
conveniences!

This is the sixth year that we are unable to solve the problem of publishing
house transportation. We desperately need a vehicle for the publishing house-
Lhc printing establishments are scattered over the city. For example, the
periodical SOKOLENOK is printed nearby us. but the bindery is at the other end
of the city. We make our day—to-day connections by telephone, and. as a rule,
this does not guarantee an absence of defective work. He take corrected copy
to Casplysk on the intercity bus-days have to be lost on such trips.

[Question] It seems that our interview will end on a pessimistic note. . . .

[Answer] No. no, and again no! The reader is awaiting good new books from

us. and it is our task, our party duty, to do everything possible to accomplish
this task and fulfill our duty. This does not require much-a bit more attention
to us from not only the party and state agencies of the republic, but also from
the Union of Writers of Dagestan.
