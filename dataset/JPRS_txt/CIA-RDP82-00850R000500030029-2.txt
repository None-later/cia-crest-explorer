detectives swooped on the property near 'nooperang about 60km from Adelaide at dawn
and discovered at least 80.000.1mature plants growing for Don along a river bed.
Senior police last night declared the plantation the most elaborate and profession-
al yet uncovered in South Australia. Extensive earthworks had been carried out on
the bed and banks by a bulldozer and the crop was watered by an intricate pressure
teed irrigation system using water from a dam. Detectives said tho plantation
would have been almost impossible to spot fro- the air because of the winding
course and thick cover from river guts. Pipes leading from the dam had been camou-
flaged until they reached a secondary pulping point where petrol engined pumps were
used to feed high pressure sprinklers. The inature plants, many in bunches of
more than five, were estimated by botanists to be about one month old, and detec-
tives said the growers would soon have had to cull the plants. No arrests had been
made last night. [Text] [Canberra m AUSTRALIAN in Buglish 26 Nov 81 p 3]

HERO!" ADDICTION IN WING PROPORTIONS REPORTED
Karachi MORNING NEWS in English 24 Jan 82 pp 1, 8

[Text] ISLAHABAD, JAN. 23: THE CHAIRMAN 0? THE NATIONAL COORDINRTION COMMITTEE
FOR HEALTH, MAJ.-GEN. (RTD) H. SHURID, TODRY SOUNDBD A NOTE 0? WARNING OVER THE
GROWING DRUG ABUSE AND SAID THAT HIROIN ADDICTION HAD ASSUHED AN ALARHING PROPOR-
TION IN PAKISTAN.

Addressing a Press conference, he said the use of drugs had spread rapidly in
Karachi Baluohistan and the NHIP. particularly the tribal area.

also present at the news conference were Chairman of the Pakistan Narcotic Control
Board, Hairsj Husain, and members of the Coordination committee, Dr. M.H. Mobbashar
and Dr. Nasir Qureshi of Rawalpindi, Dr. H.M. Zaheer Khan (Karachi), Dr. Hyder A.
Kari. Dr. Ijaz aakhsh (Gilgit) and senior officials of the Board.

Haj-Gen. Shuaib said a survey to asses the situation of heroin addiction would he
conducted soon, but added that circumstancial evidence did exist to show a rapid
growth of this menace.

Dr. Shuaib said heroin addiction was the worst kind of addiction and difficult to
treat. He expressed his concern over the general and cheap availability of the
drug in the underground market.

Tribal Area

He further said that the tribal areas are inaccesaable for the authorities and it
is difficult to control the production of this commodity there.

The recently started production of heroin is a highly alarming fact, as the opium
addicts are easily cureble,, but heroin addicts are very difficult to cure.

One of the officials also informed that this menace has now gone as far as places
like Karachi, and other large cities. There have also been reports about its in-
creasing use within the students of educational institutions, including medical
colleges and universities.

Heroin is made from opium, through a chemical process. There have also been re-
ports of small factories set up at various places within the tribal areas of the
“HEP.
In the last six months as many as 160 cases of heroin addiction have been brought
for treatment to one of the PM detoxification centres located in different parts
of the country.

This does not mean that the actual nunber of such addicts is not far more than
this figure.

Another unedical expert from Gilgit i nforlned about the opiun addicts in the Northern
Areas, however no heroin addicts have been reported so far.

There are also reports of drug addicts among the Afghan refugees. who are located
in some parts of Northern Areas. Beluchistan and MP.

A leading psychiatrist of the country. and a member of the National coordination
Committee, Dr. Hubsshir, expressed his grave concern over this situation and said
that once this problem takes place. it will be very difficult to control it.

He said that use of drugs resulted in mental sickness in most of the cases and drug
addicts who had been cured or were under treatment should be considered as mentally
handicapped people and should be given jobs out of the 2 per cent quota for jobs
recently fixed by the President General Mohamed Zia-ul-Haq.

He also emphasised the need for better health care facilities to be introduced for
curing drug addicts throughout the country.

BBC REPORT DENIED ON SOURCE OF PAKISTAN DRUGS
Karachi MORNING “ENS in English 14 Jan 82 p 5

[Text] Pakistan is becoming ‘the major centre' for the traffic of illegal narcotic
trade, according to a recent announce-est by the BBC. However, the local drug

enforcement sources categorically claim that this observation is false.

It was reported on the BBC's "News About Britain," this week, that a record
seizure of heroin was made in Britain in 1981. Host of this narcotic seized by

the British Narcotic Control officials had been coming through Pakistan, which
is now becoming the 'major centre' for illegal narcotic trade.

However. Mr M. Hubeen Ahmed Khan. Superintendent of the Drug Enforcement Cell
(Preventive Services), has said that this news report is totally false.

Host of the heroin. he said, was being transported through the 'Golden Triangle,'
comprising Thailand, Burma and other South Asian countries.

"Tribal people in these countries," he said, "are growing opium which they con-

vert into heroin. A major portion of the illegal drug traffic is also through
Turkey," he added.

Besides, much of this heroin trade, he stated, was also through India as couriers

found smuggling of narcotics through India much easier than Pakistan, because in
India the export of opium was officially allowed which served as a cover for

smugglers.
Ban on Opium Export

Hr Mubeen Khan said that the Pakistan Government did not permit the export of
these drugs under any form.

He believed that 1,000 cans of opium was being grown in certain Asian countries.
International smugglers, with connections all over the world, were finding it
easier to transport these narcotics through other countries, instead of Pakistan.

It may be stated that the Customs seized contraband narcotics in Pakistan, esti-
mated at Rs 930 million on the foreign market. during the year 80-81.

29
Tho inspectors end one Customs sepoy of the Collectornte of Centrnl Excise and
Land Customs, Peshawar, end one repay or the Quetto Collectornte were killed in
encounters with narcotic smugglers.

In 1981. there were record seizures of heroin. including clandeetine heroin Innu-
facturing laboratories. discovered in alum areas and the euburbo of Karachi.

ANTIDRUC MEASURES—The Batasang Pambansa approved last night the bill providing
for a tougher law to curb drug abuse in the country. The bill amended the
dangerous drugs law of 1972 to provide stirrer penalties and widen the scope
of the law. Under the aeendnent, the possession of permitted drugs [as heard],
cultivation and possession of seeds of all kinds of narcotics plants are
punishable with up to life imprisonment and fines reaching 30,000 pesos. The
bill now goes to President Marcos for his approval. The Batasan approved the
measure after a clause that allows as evidence the refusal of a suspected

drug user to undergo laboratory tests was removed, after it was opposed as
unconstitutional. The bill was passed 1 day before the expiration of the
deadline imposed by President Marcos on the Batasan. The president, in
stressing seriousness of the drug problem, said he would use his decree-
issuing powers to enact the bill if the Batasan failed to approve it in

1 week. [Text] [HK260032 Manila Far East Broadcasting Company in English

DRUG CONTROLS 0N YUGOSLAV; BULGARIAN BORDER
Amsterdam DE TELEGRAAP in Dutch 31 Dec 81 p 15
[Article by Andre De Krona: "Yugoslavia, Europe's Biggest Heroin Trap"]

[Teri As the struggle sgsinst drugs gets harder, customs and border
police, too. are changing their tactics. Their strategy is directed
more now towards attacking the men behind the scenes, which pro-
duces a dangerous situation because of the billions at stake.

What is found at the borders is important primarily as an indi-
cation of what is entering Europe. Our reporting team has fol-
lowed the wearisome battle against drug smuggling for five days

and nights in Dmitrovgrad, on the Yugoslav/Bulgarian border, a
primitive corner of the Balkans, where the drug nugglers run the
highest risk in all of Europe. In Yugoslavia there are more than
300 imprisoned drug couriers. According to West European statis-

tics snd data from Interpol, Yugoslavia is now conducting the most
successful fight.

Dnitrovgrad, Thursday-Who motors of the road grants, which take the slippery

grade at a crawl, growl tiresomely. The chains bite into the icy layer which the
heavy trucks themselves press from the constantly falling snow. Frequently the wheels
slip through and the modern caravan on the Bombay-London crossing comes to a halt.

At the same place on the age-old Mesopotamian trade route caravans used to travel to
Europe with mules and horse-drawn and oat-drawn wagons with spices, precious metalwork,
hides and carpets. Then armed merchants accompanied their costly trade goods, con-
stantly exposed to robbers and quick-flaring conflicts in the Balkans.

Now battle is once again being done in this rugged area and detectives and uniformed
customs men are lying in wait for one of the most expensive materials on earth: heroin,
one gram of which about 2.000 kilometers further along, in Frankfurt or Amsterdam, is
worth at least 250 guildera. They ere fighting the preventive battle against the
misery of tens of thousands of addicts and increased street crime.

Pile of Trash

The halts on the mirror-slick road leave the fatigued drivers, many of whom already
have a few thousand kilometers behind them, as cold as the weather outside. They are
used to it and know that in a few hours it will become a complete pile of trash, when

37
they land on the notorious Autoput in Nisj, a largely ill-maintained two-lane asphalt
stretch on which once acain all the freight traffic from Greece and Albania, along
with tens of thousands of passenger cars, bounces along to Austria and western Europe.

For their part, the Yugoslavian border patrol members are not concerned about the con-
dition of the drivers. "We are not standing here for the fun of it," says border post
chief Gradimir--"0'Grady"--Hadzinladzic. As a seasoned practical specialist in fight-
ing drugs at the borders, he is proud of his nickname, for the only real "Mr. O'Grady"
in this little world is an internationally famous narcotics expert from the American
"Drugs Enforcement Administration."

"On our borders, we catch nearly one-third of all heroin found in Europe. In Amster-
dam and Frankfurt, they estimate that about 10 percent is uncovered. But we think
that it is about 2 percent or even less. because even though we make the lion's share
of discoveries, they are based purely on spot checks. By agreement with Austrian,
West German and Netherlands narcotics brigades, from time to time we allow suspect

vehicles to pass through to be able to take a look behind the scenes at the destin-
ation."

A few days earlier while we sat in the (over-) heated Ministry of Information of Bel-
grade, it was made clear to my colleague Hill Dekkers and me that the detective in-
stinct of the customs man is the best means of detection. Vido Popsdic, chief of
investigations for the federal Yugoslavian customs: "Because of our lack of modern
equipment, we have just turned in a request for financial assistance with the nar-
cotics department of the United Nations in Vienna. We particularly need freezer
cabinets, so that we can also take a close look at refrigerator trucks. For, to
express it carefully, we have the strongest suspicion that a lot of heroin is also
entering Europe by way of frozen foods.

"The fact that my men are doing spectacular work despite the primitive circumstances
is because they have taken a special course in drugs detection at our customs school
here in Belgrade. Technology is unportant, but it is precisely because of the lack
of that technology that we have built up the experience that the discovery of a drug
shipment is primarily a matter of psychology, of knowing people. The behavior of
the drivers and other occupants is an important indication and the 'nose' of a cue-
toms man reacts better than the nose of a heroin dog.

"Furthermore, most recently pure, practically odorless heroin is coming in instead of
raw opium, so that we now know that once again the laboratories are located in the
production areas themselves. But just like the delivery routes and the smuggling
methods, that can change from one day to the next. Our opponent is both intelligent
and quick. He recently discovered heroin in shipment of corn. That meant that some-
where in Europe there had to be a special filtering system through which the corn
could be sifted without leaving any dangerous traces of heroin behind. Unfortunately,
our theory quickly leaked out and was published, after which the trick with the corn
was pulled out of the bag of tricks."

By Sea
According to Popadic, it is also because of the observation of behavior that Yugosla-
vian Customs is now on the track of a new heroin route by sea. "In our harbors on

the Adriatic Sea, not only are we faced with the same problems as in Rotterdam and
elsewhere, but we also have regular auto-bridge connections with Turkey and the Middle

36
East. Last summer, we drew a bead on people who came to pick up autos from the twice-
weekly ferry from the Syrian port of Tsrtus. we already knew that it had been a hash
route, but now we have discovered that it has become an important heroin route. I
always say: He took our basic training from the hash couriers, we are rounding out
our education with the heroin smugglers, but we cannot graduate yet because we still
have not gotten to see the professors of this criminal science."

0n the Yugoslav/Bulgarian border it was proven that top customs man Vido Popadic has
a right to be proud. In five times 26 hours, the customs men were successful three
times: Once at the hangdog Dmitrovgrad station, where the express from Istanbul to
Western Europe encounters its longest delay, solely because of sharpened drugs con-
trol, and twice in spot check in the column of trucks and passenger cars at the net
on the "Bombay road." Here, my colleague Dekksrs and I saw how heroin was uncovered

from under the seats of a passenger and from a--to customs eyes--renarksbly hidden
space between the rear axle and the floor of a truck.

Spare Batteries

"Dumb," say Gridimir Hadzimladzic, “but these hiding places are still used, even though
less often. The newest method, which we got onto 4 months ago, is carrying things

in spare batteries. On these long distances, both trucks and passenger cars almost
always carry all kinds of spare parts, such as contact points, a distributor cap,
belts and tires, spark plugs, and a battery. Because it is normal, we never paid any
attention to it until the end of August, when we were so good as to help a Turk who
worked in West Germany with his starting problems. when we could not get his Mercedes
230, which would not run because of the heat, and which he said ran on gas, to start
either, we wanted to take a look under the hood and at the gas tank in the trunk.

When the Turk gestured that that was too much trouble, we became more interested.
Everything appeared to be mounted properly, and if he had not been so nervous, we
would never have found the 12 kilograms of heroin in the gas tank. The car simply

ran on gasoline...."

That experience of 27 August set the Yugoslavian customs on the track of the usual
spare parts, particularly the batteries. In 4 months' time, a total of 61 kilograms
of heroin have been turned up that way. The refinement of this trick-with-the-battery:

under the hood, everything looks normal. The spare battery sits in the trunk along with
the other spare parts, packed in with suitcases, cans, and bags. But there are two

holes bored in the bottom of the spare battery, invisible at first look. The two holes
are also in the rubber mat on the floor of the trunk. The rest is a matter of re-
fined wiring: the "spare battery" is the actual source of current; the "real" battery
contains heroin.

Last Seals

Yugoslavia's customs chief, Vido Popadic: "The methods are becoming increasingly more
refined and are changed faster and faster, and when we further realize that the Bul-
garians on the Greek border, too, are discovering one new trick after another, we
sometimes ask ourselves what we are doing. With a watertight control, all traffic be-
tween Europe and the Near East would come to a halt. We also have to deal with the
problem that frequently the last goods are loaded in Istanbul and it is there that the
last lead seals are applied. here the last seals, which are 'holy" to a customs man,
weigh the heaviest, because Istanbul appears to be the point of departure, while the

39
trucks often cone from Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan or fron deep inside Turkey. [The
term: "The last seals weight the heaviest" is also a proverb meaning "It's the last
straw that breaks the camel's back." Here the meaning is both literal and figurative.
TR.] Now we are also highly interested in what happens before or in Istanbul. From
what we have discovered fron spot checks, that must be something which wcnld make the

most exciting television crime show psle into a kiddy show."

TRAFFICKING SAID TO CONTINUE IN NATION'S PRISONS
Ciudad Juarez EL FRONTBRIZO in Spanish 6 Jan 82 pp 1, 5

[Text] "So long as there are drugs on the market, there will be trafficking in the.
CeReSo [Social Rehabilitation Center] and in all of the nation's prisons." This

statement was made by Antonio Lopez Bustamante, director of the detention establish-
ment,upon being questioned on the subject.

He claimed that it is extremely difficult to eradicate the drug traffic inside
prisons and, furthermore, it is "absurd" to try to do so; noting that 90 percent
of the inmates are drug addicts.

The institution's director remarked: "Moreover, even though on both the general and
conjugal type visiting days an inspection is asde of persons coudng to see their
relatives or friends, they are quite often found to have in their possession large
amounts of toxic pills of the so-caIled 'prodoline' type."

Lopez Buatamante noted that medium-sized cans containing marihuane and toxic pills

are very often discovered, but despite the fact that this problem appears frequent-
ly, he claimed that there has been a decline in the drug traffic in comparison with
other years.

He said that this is because "I am enacting retention" for all inmates caught with
drugs; adding that from August, when the first retention took place, until the
present, 19 inmates have received retention owing to their bad behavior, disobedience
of orders from superiors or drug trafficking.

The retention consists of increasing the period of time in jail to twice what has
been given in the sentence. He said that the inmates whose term has been increased
are prisoners sentenced for various crimes.

Although the official reported that, to date, there has been no reply to the messages
sent to the state capital and to Mexico City, because this is the first time in the
prison's history that retention has been applied to the inmates, the measure was
necessary because of the bad conduct shown by certain prisoners: "They had to be

made to realize that wherever they are they must behave like normal persons."

He said that despite the fact that "I have received approval from the director of
crime prevention and from some directors of other prisons, I have not had a reply
to the messages." Adjustments must be made to the prison laws, adding the applica-
tion of retention for inmates who do not obey the prison rules.

INTENSIFIBD EFFORTS REDUCE DRUG SMDGGLING
Cairo UKTUBAR in Arabic No 267, 6 Dec 81 pp 66, 65
[Article by Ahmad Hustafa]

[Text] Why has "al-Bstaniysh." the section of Cairo most notorious for narcot-
ics dealings, become completely empty of "big dealers," retailers, and even the
"Nsdurjiyah," who are the "young kids" who act as an alarm system and warn the
dealers of "raids" by the narcotics squad?

Why have the prices of drugs risen. although few are present? The price per
"piaster of hashish" has risen to 30 and 50 pounds. when it had been 7 pounds.
Why has the price of a "piaster of opium" risen from 60 to 200 pounds? What is
the secret behind all of this?

Is there a "substitute" or "substitutes" for hashish and opium which citizens
can take? what are they?

what can the state and the various agencies do to stamp out these terrible drugs
once and for all? The official report of the Narcotics Agency in Cairo says:
"During the past 9 months. 157 kilograms of opium were seized. while in the sane
period of the preceding year more than 3,147 kilograms were confiscated.

As for hashish, during these past 9 months. nore than 50 tons were seized, while
in the sans nonths of the preceding year only 12 tons were seized.

Now, drugs have definitely disappeared. and their prices have risen drastically.

Secret of Drug Disappearance

Does the secret lie in the efforts of the border patrol of the armed forces, who
patrol all of the borders of Egypt along the sea and in the desert to prevent

smuggling?

Does it lie in the concentrated efforts of the narcotics agents and the investi-
gators in all of the governorstes of Egypt?

Does it lie in the continuous campaigns conducted night and day by police offi-
cars and investigators as they search some cars on the desert and farm roads,

h6
and police "undercover" men who are stationed on bridges and in many areas within
the cities, searching some private and rental cars and trucks looking for weapons
and sometimes finding drugs in these vehicles?

Opinion of Minister of Interior

I sought the opinion of Muhammad Nabawi Isms'il, deputy prime minister and minis-
ter of the interior. He said: "There is no doubt that the border patrol of the
armed forces has a very large role in combatting smuggling of drugs into Egypt.

I would also like to say that there is very firm cooperation between the armed
forces and the Ministry of the Interior in this field. As for combatting drugs
within Egypt, the UN has given Egypt some modern equipment and apparatus, includ-
ing airplanes to observe the movements of smugglers and look for their positions
in the mountains or on the farms, and also to look for fields planted in opium."

I left the deputy prime minister and minister of the interior preoccupied with
his many responsibilities. I sympathize with his efforts as he reads the dozens
of dossiers piled around him in his office, all of them describing activities of
members of terrorist organizations. I directed my questions to Maj Gen Mamduh
Salim Zaki, director of the Narcotics Agency, to seek his opinion.

Rising Price of Drugs

He said: "As to the rising price of drugs, I would like to say that narcotics,
like any commercial commodity offered in the markets, are subject to the law of
supply and demand. If the cost rises, that is a sign that the supply of drugs
is diminishing.

"If the price goes down, that is a sign that there are large quantitites of
drugs on the market. The disappearance of drugs from the market in all of Egypt
is attributable to the firm cooperation between the drug combatting apparatus on
the national level and the forces of the border guards, 'the first line of de-
fense.’ on whom the Ministry of the Interior relies to stop drug smuggling.
Very, very large quantities have been seized, especially in recent months." He
added: "This is in addition to the major efforts by the officers of the nar~
cotics units in Cairo and all of the governorates to follow scientific methods
and to arrest major drug dealurs and smugglers, especially in the recent period,
which has had a very great influence on the disappearance of drugs and their
absence among the citizens."

I asked: "Do you expect some dealers, the 'little guys,’ to resume their ac-
tivities after things calm down and the security and stability situation returns
to normal?"

Maj Gen Mamduh Salim Zaki replied: "I believe that the crime of dealing 'n
drugs is a social crime which can be stopped for a time but then will reappear.
It is like any other crime which cannot be completely wiped out."

He added: "However, it is very possible to put a stop to the activities of
smugglers and drug dealers, large or small, by scientific planning and other
methods such as precise and constant monitoring of their activities, and also
supervision of other narcotic substances which can enter Egypt as 'drug

substitutes ' " .

Addict is Weak Person

I asked the director of the narcotics agency: "Do yOu believe that the drug ad-
dicts will stop taking or smoking hashish, opium, or other types of drugs in
light of the scarcity of these drugs?"

He said: "I would like to tell you that drug addicts are weak and cowardly
human beings who 'mnot keep themselves from using drugs. Therefore, if the
drugs are absent, they start to look for a substitute for this type of drug,
even if it is medication that contains certain types of drugs such as codeine,
which people take to relieve coughs. Thus, it is now being noted that there is

a major shortage of certain medicines in pharmacies. medicines which contain
codeine."

He added: "There are other types of substances which affect the mental state of
people or drug users such as methsqualone makston fort. which are smuggled
into Egypt from some European countries where they are produced. During the
past 9 months of this year, more than 188 kilograms of solid substances of these
types and 179,016 centimeters of liquid substances were seized."

Question: "Is Egypt considered a drug-consuming state?"

Answer: "Yes. The most widespread drug in Egypt is hashish, which is smuggled
into Egypt from Lebanon. In recent months, huge shipments have poured into
Egypt. More than 50 tons were seized during the past 9 months, the largest
quantity .seized in the history of the narcotics apparatus. This indicates the
huge quantity of hashish produced in Lebanon and the intensity of the efforts
exerted to put an end to operations to smuggle it into Egypt. This is more than
four times the quantity of only 12 tons seized last year.

"As for opium, it is smuggled into Egypt from Turkey. In recent years. Egypt
has tried to foil the plan of Turkish smuggling rings to flood Egypt with opium
by concealing it in secret hiding places in cars shipped with some members of
the Turkish smuggling rings to Egyptian ports. When the Narcotics Agency checked
these attempts, the ring members resorted to individuals of other nationalities
(German and British). They were all apprehended, with the help of officers from
the U.S. Drug Enforc-ent Agency. They passed themselves off as American diplo-
mats and were able to mingle with the smugglers and make them believe that they
were willing to help them smuggle drugs into Egypt."

The director of the Narcotics Agency said: "There is something important that
I would like you to know. There is complete cooperation between the Narcotics
Agency in Egypt and its counterparts in America, England, Germany, Holland, Pak-
istan, and a large number of other European states. This cooperation played a
large part in arresting the rings of dangerous mugglers who were smuggling
hashish and opium in hiding places in luxury cars which were being shipped from
certain states to Egypt and. also, in secret compartments in luggage and shoes."

h8
Finally, I asked Maj Gen Hamduh Salim Zaki: ”Can the state take advantage of
this climate in which drugs have disappeared and direct some young people toward
wholesome activities to divert them fron such drugs?"

He replied: ”There are two aspects to preventing the spread of drugs.

"The first is fighting then. That is complemented by prevention and treatment
by the various information media, such as television, the press, radio, movies.
etc."

"If the media acted in solidarity and cooperated, with sound guidance from the
state. young people could be guided to sound ways to serve the nation and could
be prevented from turning to drugs or substitute pills which can cause mental and
nervous disorders and even death."

MORE THAN ONE TON OF HEROIN. OPIUH SEIZED
Tehran ETTELA'AT in Persian 18 Jan 82 p 2
[Report by Col Bakhtegan. chief of the Antinarcotics Department]

[Excerpt] Officers of the Antinarcotica Department of the National Police of

the Islamic Republic of Iran [IRI] have seized more than one ton of heroin
and opium.

Hojjateleslam Nateq-Nuri, minister of the interior, and Col Hejazi, chief of
the National Police of the IRI inspected the narcotics seized.

Colonel Bakhtegan, chief of the Antinarcotics Department. in regard to these
seizures, stated: 'This year, officers of this department have seired about
2,250 kilograms of heroin and morphine and 3,260 kilograms of opium and
hashish." He added: '1he activities of this department in comparison to
the number of its personnel are tremendous."

While pointing out the inadequacies of this department. Col Bakhtegan said:
'The job of the personnel is loo-percent police work and sometimes strike-force
work. according to plans made in advance. As a matter of fact, we have control
from a distance. and we keep watch on the country's borders from here. And the
important thing about this is that in making these massive seizures we do not
have many casualties, so that during this period of activities we have suffered
only one casualty along with several persons shot and wounded-and that was due
to their own lack of experience. Every time these consignments change hands,
more than 30 armed men accompany the shipments, whereby our officers are faced
with certain dangers."

Regarding the distribution of narcotics in Iran, Col Bakhtegan said: "This
problem has several causes. one of which is lack of control at the borders--
whether air. water or land--as if we were leaving the faucet turned on and
then trying to collect the water coming out of it; and this is very difficult!
Instead of this. we should turn off the faucet completely so the water would
not flow out. We should destroy the source of the heroin. Another difficulty
consists of the 2 million Afghan refugees whom, even at the best, we would say

that 200,000 of them are smugglers who play a very active role in smuggling
narcotics into Iran."
”Another problem is unemployment which causes a number of people to engage
in smuggling in order to support their families; for this work is very
profitable. 0n the Afghan border, a kilogram of heroin sells for 1 million
rials, and when this heroin reaches Tehran, it is sold for about 20 million
rials retail, that is, after being augmented with various additives.

"Yet another problem is the war imposed by Iraq, which has engaged most of
our law-enforcement organizations. we hope that the war will end soonest
with victory for us and that these forces can handle the narcotics problem."

In another part of his remarks. Col Eakhtegan said: "In order to combat this
ruinous plague. we have submitted plans to the authorities which, unfortunately.
have not been carried out. Narcotics are not a traditional crime but an
international crime. All smugglers conduct a certain kind of operation on a
worldwide level, and their job is to destroy human societies."

Colonel Bakhtegan then said: "Officers of Team Eight of this department, in
connection with these seizures, have arrested four international smugglers.
[see photo] One of these smugglers is Haj Abdolghani Kamalzahi, known as

Haj Allahdad, who has a force of more than 5,000 men; and for 20 years the
police officers had not been able to arrest him. Another one is Naser Soltani
who had been active in this field for a long time; and two Afghan persons
were also among them; their names are Seyyed Hasan Madares and Bank Lalmir.
They had been bringing narcotics into Iran and smuggling out gold bars."

ROTTERDAH PORT EXPECTS INCREASE IN HEIDI“ SHDGGLING
Rotterdam BET VRIJE VOLK in Dutch 13 Jan 82 p 17

[Text] Rotterdam--Custoas in the Rotterdam port fear a hefty
increase in heroin smuggling in the coming months. They base
this fearful prediction on information about a very rich poppy
harvest in the Golden Triangle, an area in Thailand, Burma and

Campuchea.

Last year the customs only intercepted 7 kilos of heroin. h.H. huisman. head of
the Rotterdam Customs detective service: "That is because last year the heroin
was imported mainly from Turkey. and that route runs overland. For smuggling from
the Far East. on the other hand. Rotterdam is a prominent port of entry and exit."

The seven kilos of heroin is presumed to he only 10 percent of the total quantity
which passed through the port last year. Customs, which is prepared for the coming
of the new wave of heroin. hopes to catch a few more kilos this year. which will
also he assumed to be only 10 percent. In fact. the inspectors at the port have
nothing more to go on than their own "finger-tip feeling."

"Certainly not every container gets opened." says huisman. Even though not much of
the highly addictive heroin is intercepted. a great deal of illegally imported
luxury goods such as hash and marijuana ars found. Customs caught a total of 3890
kilograms of hash and 1362 kilograms of marijuana last year.

Custons detective huisman: "I am surprised each time at the inventiveness of the
smugglers. Still. it all does come down to the same thing: making room in
'normal' articles in which you can hide your goods. We are currently encountering
hash and marijuana. particularly that which comes from Ghana and Columbia. fre-
quently in loads of household goods.

The special attention of customs is accorded to such apparently common articles as
televisions. furniture and packages of dried shrimp. In the case of the 10 kilos
of marijuana which was recently found in the arms and backs of cane chairs from
Ghana. it was the highfreighthill which raised the suspicions of customs.

The whole thing came apart at Christmas when the investigators get tips that the
Finns were getting their supplies by the use of courts and hiding places on E 18.
Six armed policemen took the 2 Finns by surprise at Langangen on 22 December--
after several days of standing watch. It was learned later that the Finnish
couriers. who had been sent out from Sweden, had put half a kilogram of ampheta-
mine away in a hiding place on the Lillegird cliffs. The hiding place was dis-
closed after the couriers had been imprisoned in Sweden between Christmas and

New Year's. The police could then get the drugs-~the biggest seizure of ampheta-
mines ever made here in Norway.

Big Fishes

The Swedish press is still saying nothing about the affair, because the police
there are planning early arrests and raids. The Skien police describe the two

arrested Finns as big in narcotics, but hope that still bigger fish will wind up
in the not.

At a press conference in Skien yesterday the police indicated that the Finns
realized that they were being pursued by the police. and managed several times
to get away in fast cars.

The Finns have made big money-on their narcotics business in the Grenland areas.
But they themselves claim that they got rich on gambling winnings and hard work.
