[Text]

One oi first destinations
oi the Yomiuri reporters'
trip was Slchuan Province.

Btreii'hlnt! in the upper
reaches oi the Yangtae
river. the province is known
as the native place of Vice-
Prcmit-r Deng Xiaoping. the
architect 0! China's mod-
erniution drive and the
mentor of newly installed
Chairman Hu Yaobong.

The trip to Slchuan. about
1.600 kilometers southwest
oi Peking. came at the
strong suggestion of Vice-
Premier Wan u — one oi
Deng's right-hand men in
charge oi executing the en-
visioned “readjustment" oi
the Chinese national eco-
nomic programs.

in an exclusive interview
with the Yomiuri reporters
given in June at the Great
llail oi the People in Peking.
Wan hi was surprisingly
bold in criticizing “detects"
ol the peome's commune
system. which was conven-
tionally considered the basis
oi the Chinese communism.

"Under the people‘s com-
mune system as it is. no
development of our coun-
try'; agriculture could be
hoped ior.” Wan declared.

"This is because an ab-
surdly large number of ad-
ministrative orders and re-

eulnlnns brim: issued by
umber ornam- have imposed
m. luau-y burdens on lurin-
erx oi the communes." he
Sllilt'd

"in elchuan Province.” he
said. “experiments are under

23' the commune W

The people's commune can;
be deﬁned as an 'all-inclué
rive rural community com-.
petent of dealing with any
aﬂairs ranging from agri-
cultural and industrial pro-
duction. commerciai'activi-
ties. medical services, educa-

tion to military exercises.

1!) put more simply, it
can be likened to a com-
bination or an agricultural
cooperative as seen in Japan
and a local administration.

Its land is, collectively
owned and the ear-ulna ob-
tained through joint labor
or the commune members
are shared on a uniform
basil.

Since in inauguration in
1958 with a ianiare or an
"experiment of the century"
for materialidng the com-
munist ideal. the system h. i
now taken root in ru.
areas throughout Chino.
.shouid the people's com-
mune system be reiormed
drastically as suggested by
Vice-Premier Wan. what
changes would entail in
Chinese rural communities?

May it be that the Chi-
nese Government has been
determined to do only with
the commune-based policy:

ed for more than two de-

ygreiriiozating the direction in
which the commune reiorm
is envisaged. Wan said
"ﬁrst priority should be
given to what is needed ior
mmoting iarmers own
benefits irom the corn-

"in order to effect this.
the economic function oi
the people's communes must

be clearly separated irom
their administrative and
other iunctlons," he pointed
out.

[is Japanese experts in
Chinese aiiairs see it. the
people‘s commune system
has done much indeed in
eliminaUng disparity in
wealth among iarmers and
also in uniformly raising
and stabilising their living
standards.

Not a iew demerits. how-
ever. have been cited. They
are mainly attribuwd to the
iuct that the eommunes'
economic and administrative
activities have been iunc-
tionlng on a mixed basis.

For one thing. there were
reportedly a number oi in-
stances where commune
farmers were obliged under
administrative orders to en-
gage in construction labor
ior nothing in public works

projects and even to have
plots oi their communes put
under requisition.

Another report said an oi-
ilelal assigned by the cen-
tral government to the top
post oi a Shanghai people‘s
commune was a sheer ama-
teur about economic mat-
iera,'but he went recklessly
in drawing up the com-
mune‘s production plans.
creating serious problems
ior the commune members
because oi his blunders.

On top oi these bureau-
cratic evils. the worst oi
demerits oi the conventional
people's commune system is
considered stemming irom
the iact that those oom-

Shift In

Farm Policy

An ofﬁcial Chinese report
admitted a drop in the
country's grain production
last year. but it was said
that the amount of grains
on tree village markets in-
creased.

This is apparently due to
a shilt in China's agricul-
tural policy which allows
Chinese farmers to use part
ol their land tor storing and
disposing of the grains in
an Increased amount.

Last March. this policy
was further revised. Now
larmers are authorised to
keep aside l5 percent oi
farms lor storage oi grains
or vegetables for their own
disposal. The percentage
was previously seven per-
cent. This policy change is
expected in bring about a
further expansion or free
markets.

FERTILIZER FROM JAPAN-«itsubishi Chemical Industries, Letd, Shows Denko
Company and Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd have decided not to export urea
fertilizer to China for the period from July to December 1981. Under a
contract signed with China in late September. Japan's fertilizer producers
are scheduled to export 380,000 tons of urea fertilizer to China in the
July-December period. However, many companies are losing interest in exports
because fertilizer prices f.o.b. are about 1.0 percent lower than for domestic
contracts. Sumitomo Chemical Company had earlier suspended its urea
fertilizer exports to China, and with the three firms following suit, there
is growing unrest among fertilizer producers who have long been suffering

from structural recession. [Tokyo NIKON KEIZAI SHIHBUN in Japanese 14 Oct 81
