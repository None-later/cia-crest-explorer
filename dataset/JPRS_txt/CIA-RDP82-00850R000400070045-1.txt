SUZUKI PLANS RBSHUFFLE IN PARTY LINEUP
TokyoHAINIClII DAILY NEWS in English 26 Oct 81 p 1
[Article by Yamato Ishigami]

[Text] Portland, OregonuPrime Minister Zenko Suzuki told the Japanese press
here Saturday that he intends to carry out a major reshuffle of the top officials
of the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party in late November in a move to promote
younger LDP members.

The terns of party executives will expire on Nov 27 and, Suzuki said, this pro-
vides a good time to fora a new party leadership.

He also said that the current Diet session will be over by that date, indicating
that he will carry out the reshuffle around Nov 27.

In the formation of the new party echelon, Suzuki said he will put top priority
on the promotion of younger members of the LDP.

This remark can be translated that the prime minister intends to give a chance to
politically young LDP leaders, such as liichi hiyazawa, hichio Hatanabe, Noboru
Takeshita, and Ichiro Nakagawa, who have not held party executive posts.

Suzuki met the press here on his way home from Cancun, Mexico, where he attended
the North-South sumit conference Thursday and Friday.

0n the cabinet reshuffle. which is also expected to come in November, Suzuki said
it does not have to be directly linked with the change in ID? executives.

"Frankly. both the party and the cabinet are doing quite well, much better than
expected, and there are few waves in the party," Suzuki told the press.

It is not clear why the prime minister wants to separate the LDP executive reshuf-
fle and that of cabinet members.

Most political observers say Suzuki believes any reference to the cabinet reshuf-
fle at this moment would irritate opposition parties and hinder passage of the

administrative reform bills which Suzuki is pushing through the current Dist
session.

But the observers say the reshuffle of party executives and the cabinet changes
are closely linked and that they will most probably come at the sane tine.

Despite the prime minister's cautious wording, the observers say, his press
remarks will accelerate the moves of the party factions toward the reshuffles.

RESHUFFLING OF SUZUKI CABINEI, LDP LEADERSHIP AMICIPATE

Tokyo THE JAPAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL 1n Englilh 27 Oct 81 p 10

There have been considerable maneuvers

factions opposing him. Accordlnly. unless
he makes a set-iota blunder. all indications
are that Sarah wtu be reelected to the LDP

whether Prime Minister Suzuki can form a
framework conducwe to his reelection as
party president and what will happen to the

reach the hallway mark in its
discussions oi the bills related
to administrative reiorm. on
which Prime Minister Zenito
Sinuiti is staking his political
lite. most members oi the ruling

iocuslng their attention on a
ditiererd issue.

This issue is the reshuiile oi
Cabinet members and party
executives adiethtled to talte
place at the end oi November
ioliowing the close oi the ex-
traordinary Diet session.

The reason why the Diet
members oi the Liberal-Dem-

the November reshttiiie is that
the administrative reiorm de
hates are proceeding smoothly
and there are good prospects
that the related bills Will pan

being able to weather the Diet

Observers interpret the tact
that Suzuki is now making the
Cabinet reshuii'ie his main con-
cern as meaning that he is no
longer worried about the cur-
rent progreee at business in
the Diet.

Prime Minister Sua'thfwho

Prime Minister Zenlto Sunt-
ki is now very cautious about
making a visit to the Middle
East early next year. despite
the fact that be has been
showing great enthusiastn
about making one in the past
month. ‘

New developments in the
Middle East and domestic po-
litics have made him cltange
his mind.

Since assuming office.
Suzuki has visited Southeast
Asia. the United States and
Western Europe and attended
sumrntts in Ottawa and
Mexico. and. excluding South
Korea and China. the place
he should go to next in the
current international economtc
and litical circumstances is
the .fiddle East. After the
death of Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat and the Visit to
Japan of Palestine Liberation
0:;antzauon (PLO) leader
’{asser Arafat. a con-
crete plan was discussed.

Surulti became enthusiastic
al-rr he was urged to visit the
Middle East by Foreign Min—
ister Sttnao Sonoda on his re-
turn from a trip to Cairo to
attend Sadat's funeral. and it
appeared almost certain that
the Prime Minister would fly
to the Middle East as early as
nest January.

Nevertheless. after the
North-South summit in Can-
cun. Mexico. Suzuki changed
his attitude.

sensed that people within the
ruling Liberal-Democratic Par-
ty and the Government were
not altogether happy about his
making the visit.

Though the Government's
acceptance of Arafat's
visit was praised as a new ap-

roach. than people in the

DP and overnment feel
that Japan should not try to
take the initiative in settling
problems in the Middle East
since the political situation
there is extremely complex and
What Japan can do is very
litnited.

Another factor is that it is
difficult to predict what will
happen in the Middle East af-
ter Hosni Mubarak's succesp
sion to the Egyptian presidency
and the US. sale of AWACS
radar planes to Saudi Arabia.

On the domestic political
scene. a Cabinet reshuffle '5
expected soon. Sonoda is un-
der increasing fire for his man-
agement of Japan's foreign
policy within the LDP. and i.‘
Suzuki decides on an ear-
ly Middle East trip. it may
be taken to mean that Sonoda
will retain his resent post in a
reshuffled Ca ‘net.

However. the Gaitnu-
sho thinks that. when Saudi
Arabia‘s Prince Fahd visits
here in early December. Su-
zulti will have to give a date
for his return visit to Riyadh.
The Gaimushn still hopes that
the Prime Minister will make

IMPLICATIONS OF TANARA-FUKUDA MEETING VIEWED

Tokyo THE JAPAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL in English 27 Oct 81 p 10

[Text] The news that former prime ministers Kakuei Tanaka and Takeo Pukuda
totally unexpectedly met over lunch at a restaurant in Tokyo last Friday caused
considerable stirring: within the Liberal Democratic Party.

And this is no wonder for a few reasons. First, they are the two strongman who
virtually keep the incumbent Zenko Suzuki Government afloat. But, second, they
have been at odds with each other and have never met in private in the past five
years since their confrontation over Tanaka's implication in the Lockheed scan-
dal. Third, in connection with the second reason, what made their meeting all
the more controversial and a target of speculation and suspicion is the impend-
ing reshuffle for the Suzuki Cabinet scheduled for next month.

Merging from the meeting, which lasted for half an hour or so, both Tanaka and
Fukuda in a good mood stressed the casual nature of the occasion. But however
much they denied anything serious about it, it was enough to arouse various fac—
tions and worry particularly the faction led by Suzuki himself. For Suzuki's

dealing between the two men could seriously affect this balancing act. For one
thing, closer ties between the two strongmen will provide them with increased
influence over intra-party affairs and power broking.

0 FORCE INCREASE IN DEFENSE SPENDING CRITICIZED

Y YOHIURI in English 3 Nov 81 p 2

Two attempts in the US Congress to force J’l'p'an
to spend more on its defense have come to nothing
but to indicate growing impatience in the US toward
this country. -

A hawkish member of the US Senate submitted a
resolution demanding revision of the Japan-US se-
curity treaty to pressure this nation into doing more
for its defense. It was reported that a Japanese critic
urged the senator to submit such a resolution. The
critic denied this.

The senator was persuaded to withdraw the res-
olution and. therefore. no major problem will arise.
But Japan must henceforth be watchful of such senti-
ments in Washington. -

Last week. a resolution was submitted to Congress
demanding that Japan pay 2 percent of its GNP to
the US as a “security tax." We doubt the sanity of
the congressman who proposed such a resolution.

Security Pact Is Stabilizer

First we would like to stress that the security
treaty is the basis of the strong bond and friendship
between Japan and the US. This treaty can neither be
.scrspped nor revised in view of the situation in Asia
which would be seriously destabilized by such action.

We realise that behind such a proposal was the
dissatisfaction in the Us with what is interpreted as
"Japan's free ride" on the treaty without its assum-
ing a greater defense burden. However. the US is re-
ceiving beneﬁts from the treaty which it must keep
in mind. The security treaty helps ensure the se-
curity of the Far East and Pacific.

The proposal to impose a tax of- two percent of our
GNP hardly deserves comment. Why should Japan
pay such a tax? Japan fulﬁlls its duties under the
security treaty and performs an equitable defense
role. The congressman should be reminded that Japan

‘ '1 1

is not US territory and therefore the US has no
right to tax us.

Silly Proposals Backﬁre

Nevertheless. such prepceterous proposals could act
to stimulate US dissatisfaction. We are particularly
concerned about any linkage between la 'a defense
budget and Japan's trade surplus with US. which
is expected to reach 815 billion this year. The govern-
znent should tslte action to prevent the trade problem
from worsening relations with the US. ‘

Also. it is a questionable practice for a Japanese

it is not the US which will decide whether our con-
stitution is changed or the substance of our foreign
policy. This is the sole right of the Japanese people.

Nobuhiho Ushibe. former

t;ve of the Japan-US Eco-
nomic Group better known
as the Wisemen's Group.
said that the latest unique
friction over scope of power
of mlnisteries in both the
Japanese end U8 cavern~
ments will hamper solution
to the bilateral economic is-
sues.

He expressed his views at
a press meeting held after
the Japanese side of the
group last Tuesday present-
ed to Prime Minister Suzu-
ki the final report concern-
ing the medium-range
aspects of the Japan-08
economic relations.

Friction of this kind has
a long history. But the lat-
est friction was witnessed
in the triieterel ministerial
conference among Japan,
the us and West Europe.

The tact that the report
refers to the conference
means that friction over
competency of the tripar-
tite conference has intensi-
lied.

This international confer-
ence came into existence
glowing a proposal by the

The domestic dispute over
the conference was touch-
ed off by an invitation to
international Trade and In-
dustry Minister Mute
'i‘anaha from as Special

liam r. Brock.

It was natural for Brock
to sent the invitation to

to be the main leader or

ularly trading. in the caps-
city of international trade
and industr? minister.

But this l:. terly provoked
the Foreign Ministry on the
ground that it was unpreo
cedented that um be plac-
ed in the upper gallery with
regard to an international
_conference.

Under such circumstances.
the Foreign Ministry con-
tacted the 08 Department
of State about the confer-
ence. It was told that the
conference was planned
voluntarily by the trade
reprwentative without eon-
suiting the State Depart-
ment.

‘i‘aneka. however. had
earlier sent a letter ex-
premine his wish to attend
the meeting.

To make matters worse.

The Lockheed trial has

JAPAN SOCIALIST PARTY SUPPORTER'S VIEWS WRESSED

- Tokyo MAINICHI DAILY news in English 1. Nov 81 p 2

(Editorial:

[Text]

".18? and Enthusiasm"]

Nearly one year has passed since Japan Socialist
Party Chairman ichio Asuhata. during the JSP
convention toward the end of last year. called for
"burning action" by the largest opposition party. Has
the JSP continued "burning?"

At least the general public does not think so.
Party members. claimed to be about 50.000. may have
continued steady activities but the party as a whole
has failed to impress us. We point out that the
Asukata leadership is inadequate.

The frank view of the JSP supporters is that the
dispute between the leftist and rightist groups on the
socialist policy line has continued too long. On Oct. 29. .
the party central executive committee members
agreed to review the "road to socialism in Japan."
aimed at putting an end to the dispute by 1983. We tear
that the party will put an end to the dispute with an
ambiguous compromise. Judging from the past
developments involving intra-party disputes.

We call for JSP members to engage in effective
discussions and reach a clear-cut conclusion. A
repetition of compromises for convenience’s sake.
based on the excuse of maintaining party unity. will
result in a further deteriorated image of the party.
Some 10 million voters for the party are not
necessaril y active supporters.

To respond to such a demand. the JSP must
remodel itself into a strong party based on actual

society. The inﬂexible socialist theory defined in the
"road” is no longer practical. The decision to review

the "road" is a natural outcome. We call for both the
leftists. the supporters oi the “road" theory. and the

28

APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/0ﬂ09: ClA-RDP82-00850R000400070045-1
rightists to engage in a tranli exchange oi views to put
an end to the dispute.

Cotncidentally. various movements have sur-
faced in the Japan Socialist Party. For example. the
JSP Tokyo branch has been split into two due to the
difference oi views on the “road” between the two
rival groups. Another example is a recent demand
from a rightist wing tor the resignation oi the Asukata
leadership and its support tor a rival candidate who
will compete for the chairmanship with Asukata in
the December election:

We believe that the JSP must bear a heavier
responsibility in the current decade and would like to
see the JSP really burning with enthusiasm.

KASUGA EAGER TO ACHIEVE COALESCENCZ OF CENTRIST FORCES

lltko Kasuga. adviser to the
Democratic Socialist Party.
attended a "People's Coo-
ierence to Protect Japan" on
Oct. :6 and spoke in iront oi
about 2000 people. This con-
lerence has a strong con-
servative coloring but its local
organizations have already
been termed in 23 prelecturas.

In his speech. Kasuga
criticized the Liberal-

thatwhilethe LDPhasdecided.

In addition. although a
cabinet decision has been
reached to study legislation to
cope with an emergency. this
has not been done as yet. The
LDP only pays lip-service and
does nothing—this is Kasttga's
criticism.

Speaking in typical Kasoga
style at the time. he said. "as
tar as thinking is concerned.
even a university coed can
think—as tar as talking is
concerned. even comic dia-

What this Kasuga is

been prepared.

The Komeito responded bathe

snow the attintde that it a
coalescence oi cerium iorces
could be achieved the Komeito
would be willing to dissolve the

FORMER GENERALS DBPLORE 'SELF DEFENSE PORCES'

Tokyo BUNCEI SHUNJU in Japanese Jul 81 pp 98-106

[Discussion involving the following participants: liirooni Kurisu, for-er chairnan
of the Joint Staff Council and a general in the Ground Self Defense Force; Kazuoni
Uchida, forner chief of Staff, Maritime Self Defense Force; Goro 'rakeda, former
chairman of the Joint Staff Council and a general in the Air Self Defense Force]

[Text] United States and Soviet Union Preparing for Sometiae in the 1980's

(Question: There is a theory in the streets that a crisis will occur in the 1980's.
People are saying that there will be a large-scale military event with the character-
istics of World "at III. At the Hawaii conference, the United States lads very
specific and strict danands for the Japanese defense effort. I have heard that this
was based on a scenario of trouble beginning in the Middle East and resulting in an
invasion of Hokkaido by the Soviet Any. "hat about that?

Takeda: I think it is doubtful that a f ire starting up in the Middle East would
immediately spread to Hokkaido. Before that, it could go to Europe or the Korean
Peninsula could stand in its way. In fact, it night start in Korea. Yugoslavia
is also dangerous.

Uchida: Everything is linked up.

Question: If a Middle East war occurs red, the Seventh Fleet would nova into the
Indian Ocean. The Soviet Union would attempt to nova into the gap. and Japan would
try to close the three straits around the Japanese islands to stop then. This
would result in a local war. That's the scenario, right?

Uchida: There is the question of why it would break out in the Middle East. Also,
we must consider the preliminary conditions that would cause the Soviet Union to

go that far. It would do that if it reached the point of being put in an impossible
position when it tried to maintain the status quo. This would happen if it decided
it was necessary to find a way to escape fro. the dwindling state of its fortunes

or if it could not maintain the columnist systen any longer. At such s time, it
night make a move in the Middle East, if that were the easy thing to do. It could
move into Japan and cause a disturbance, and then asks a frontal assault on NATO.

Or it could attack NATO first and then cone to Japan or cause trouble on the Chinese
border. It is first and then come to Japan or cause trouble on the Chinese border.
It is conceivable that it would follow a pattern of asking a nova where it is easiest.

What America fears most is that the Soviet Union is in a position to move in any
direction. And in reality, the state of Russian military expansion is awesome.

For example, in submarines, it plans to build 60 vessels a year. America is only
building 12. That is three times as such. In addition, these submarines will carry
cruise missiles and they can dive to 1,300 meters. There are a large number of
these and they are very well equipped. In addition, it is building aircraft car-
riers and cruisers. It is carrying out a military expansion beyond our imagination.
when we see this happening right before our eyes, we cannot say that America is
lying to us or threatening us. We have to believe that it is serious.

Takeda: During the first part of the Carter administration, America thought that

if it slowed down the military expansion, Russia would respond because it was having
economic difficulties. However, even though Russia declined economically, its mili-
tary expansion continued. Then, with the invasion of Afghanistan, even the Carter
administration realized that it had made a mistake.

Uchids: America is attempting to complete preparations to counter the Soviets by
the tentative target of 1985. So the pace of preparation in Japan will not match
that of the United States.

Question: We can cope with the period after 1985, but are we in danger before then?
In the short term, is there a chance for the Soviet Union?

Uchida: Yes, if the Soviet Union makes the decision now to resort to military power.
I do not think it has gone that far yet.

However, if a conflict were to occur in the Middle East, and oil stopped coming to
Western Europe and Japan, there would be a big shift in the balance of power. Wea-
term Europe and Japan, there would be a big shift in the balance of power. Western
Europe depends on the Middle East for approximately 600 million tons of oil. Japan
is buying about 200 million tons. If a conflagration were to occur there, it would
be very threatening. Therefore, we are doing our best to prevent that from happen-
ing. The Soviet Union also desires to maintain the status quo. Things are all
right now because of fear and a military balance. Just the same, if religious or
political troubles were to blow up in the Middle East and spread over the entire
area, the Soviet Union would immediately have an advantage. The free countries
would not be able to use Middle Eastern oil. If that happened the military balance

would be upset.
Japan Is About the Right Size for the Soviet union

Takeda: Even if the Soviet Union does not intend to start a world war, if some-
thing started in the Middle East, it could be drawn into it, and things could esca-

late. Then, to restore its situation, it is possible that it might set its sights
on a weak place to make an advance.

Kurisu: In the 18th century, Russia annexed more than 1 million square kilometers.
In the 19th century, it absorbed 500,000 square kilometers in Southeast Asia alone
and close to 1 million square kilometers in other areas. In the 20th century, it
did not gain much territory until the last war, but with the war, it gained 680,000
square kilometers, including the three Baltic countries. It is not yet up to 1
million. Japan has about 370,000 square kilometers so it is just about the right
size. (laugh) That is a joke. (laugh)

Uchida: Intimidation is possible as a tactic.

Tskede: It would never threaten Japan alone without thinking about a world war.
If the Soviets made a move. the United States would counter it. This is the fate
of a country like Japan, situated between the great powers. If Japan gave in to
Soviet intimidation, the thited States would try the same thing.

Kurisu: Nixon says that World War III has already begun but that the great war
is not characterized by an exchange of nuclear attacks. It is a psychological war
carried out by threat and intimidation. A psychological war aims at getting the
opponent to give up.

However, someone spoke of America getting its military forces ready by 1985. I
believe this has been postponed. The aodernization plans for each of the three
services will take until 1987-88 for completion. Such itens as the Trident sub-
marine, a 600-vessel fleet, and the 3-1 (supersonic heavy boaher) will all take
until 1988 to be completed.

Takeda: All of them were put aside during the Carter administration.

Kurisu: And the same thing is reported of the Soviet Union. Even the Siberian
railroad will not be completed by 1985. Both the United States and the Soviet Union
have had to extend their tentative deadline beyond 1985. In brief, it sears that
they are postponing the deadline for their buildup to the late eighties or the

early nineties. This is not a target date for conflict. It is a deadline for reach-
ing a position where these countries can be at peace with themselves while being
conscious of the Opponent. I do not think that America's military power has declined
at all. The gap has only closed up more.

War Moves With the Momentum of the Times

Takeda: If things keep going at this rate, the United States will be completely
surpassed by the Soviet Union. Therefore. they are working to open up the gap.
They probably even want to speed up Reagan's 5-year plan.

Kurisu: That is why I think that both the United States and the Soviet Union will
tend to suppress any sparks of trouble. While their forces are unprepared, they

will just be bluffing each other. They are not really serious. So I think that
if something happened in Europe or the Middle Beat, it would probably move to con-

trol it.

Takeda: Until it is ready, that is probably right. But war is not something that
goes that anoothly. If trouble were to start in Poland next month, there is no
telling how far it would spread. It would flow with the momentum of the times.
That is why we must make the minimum necessary preparations.

Question: I would like to know roughly what stages the Japanese defense guidelines
have passed through since the creation of the Self Defense Forces and what phase
they are in now.

34

Takeda: In 1957, the Basic National Defense Plan appeared. It called for gradual
progress in preparing for national defense on the basis of the U.S.-Japan Hutual
Security Treaty and within necessary limits. depending on the national situation.
Based on this, we have increased our strmgth in 20 years from the first basic
defense plan through the fourth basic defense plan.

However, the fourth basic defense plan took effect around 1972-73, the main years
of detente. The people began to wonder why defense spending continued to increase
in an era of peace. Questions on this were heard from the opposition parties in
the Diet. Therefore, in 1976, the 1976 defense plan guidelines were prepared with
the idea that a new defense policy was necessary.

This rested on the view that world peace would continue for some time, based on

five conditions: First, there would not be a large war, a nuclear war, between

the United States and the Soviet Union. Second, the antagonism between the Soviet
Union and China would continue. Third, the U.s.-Japan mutual security arrangement
would be firmly maintained. Fourth, there night be small disturbances, but no

large ones, on the Korean Peninsula. And finally, the friendly relationship between
the United States and China would continue. The Middle East situation was not even
considered.

In other words. the conclusion was not reached by s nilitary analysis. It was
reached by saying that our present defense capability is this much, so next let's
add a certain amount. The set idea of keeping it within 1 percent of the GNP derives
from this.

Uchida: A goal for preparedness was never set.

Takeda: There is no mention of when certain things must be done. There is only
the bague idea of "a defense capability which can repel a limited, small-scale in-
vasion unaided." However, the government made this decision, and we night have
been all right if a certain amount of effort had been given to defense and main-
taining the rate of growth. But because of the rise in prices and other reasons,
the content of our preparedness plan has continually been reduced. In the Air
Self Defense Force, the 630 aircraft we should have had was reduced to 340.

Even then, the government at the tine declared that this was the mininum necessary
defense capability. In spite of that, it seems that this will not even be achieved
by 1987, so the whole thing is ridiculous.

Pooling the People

Kurisu: I have a slightly different view from Mr Takeda. Up through the fourth
basic plan we at least evaluated the situation and presented the goals we desired
for 5 years. However. the subsequent defense guidelines do not include any situ-
ational judgment with reference to basic defense capability. In other words, an
order was given for a time to stop in the situation of 1975. The idea for military
preparedness was to continue what was done under the third and fourth basic defense
policies, in other words, to maintain the status quo. I believe it is misleading

the people to bring this out now as if it were a real goal.

FOR OMCIAI. USE ONLY

Unless the government changes this approach i-edietely, the basic defense of Japan
cannot be secured. This is equivalent to not thinking about defense at ell. I an
severely critical on this point.

Tskeds: The cabinet when the fourth defuse policy was adopted was the Hiki cabi-
net, wasn't it?

Uchids: At any rate, it seens strange that the things promised in 1976 will be ful-
filled 10 years later. When they say they don't know if they can do it by 1987,
they are double-crossing the people twice over.

Kurisu: The true feeling of the civilians is that this is nothing but a policy
for coping with the Diet and the nedia. They put everything in a nedicinel wsfer
with sugar on it.

Takeda: That plan started up on tine even though all the chiefs of etsff opposed
it.

Kurisu: Yes. it did, didn't it?

Takeds: I said earlier that there is no nilitary logic in the stendsrde of the
defense guidelines. Even in the case of a linited snall-scsle invasion, not enough
considerst ion has been given to what size fource would cone and whet torn it would
take. Even if we are to fight together with the Mexicans when the Self Defense
Forces cannot repel the invasion alone, there is no understanding of how this will
be done. Everyone has hidden under the big shadow of Mice.

'Thinking Conittee' Leaving Out the Military

Uchida: He have prepared nany proposals. However, they are research naterisl and
have not been publicized.

Tskeds: What we need to ask ourselves is whether agreenent has been attained be-
tween the Ground, Air, and Haritine Self Defense Forces. The answer is no. He
are divided.

Uchids: Just the sane, as long as we are restricted to 1 percent of the GRP, no
plan can amount to such.

Tskeda: The idea of 1 percent of the GNP was developed at the one ties as the
defense guidelines.

Kurisu: Then the ”Co-sittee to Think About Defuse" was formed and we presented
a report to then.

Tskeda: The Co-ittee to Think About Defense was formed under the sponsorship of
the director of the Defense Agency at the tine, Salute. I believe it was nade up
of five or six intellectuals such as the late political analyst, Kazushige Birosawe,
and the writer, Pussko Tsunoda.

Uchida: There was also one before that during the term of Mr Nahaone.

Takeda: There was a briefing on keeping within 1 percent of the GNP during the
Nakaaone period, too, so I suppose the "thinking co-ittee" took the approach of
supporting the Defense-Agency's proposal. Actually, someone with experience as
chairman of the Joint Staff Council should have been a part of the eo-nittee. Hith
some military advice. a new awareness of the problns should have emerged.

Kurisu: To state the case in stronger terms, former chairmen and nabers of the
Joint Staff Council should have been doing the "thinking."

Uchida: The military presented a number of proposals for the second and third basic
defense plans. The government listened to them but in the end did not have ears

to hear. The initial plans were completely revised and we had to put up with plans
reduced to the lowest possible level with none of what you referred to as military
logic. These things should have been decided on the basis of an active debate
between the government and the military. However, under civilian control, we are
slapped down and all debate is stopped.

Therefore, the people on the frontline are placed in a difficult position. The
Maritime Self Defense Force may be a special case, but since there is no standard
for what is absolutely necessary, it is possible to make an estimate by judging
that in relative terms a certain task can be performed with a certain force. For
example, Prime Minister Suzuki spoke about patrolling the waters within a few
hundred miles of Japan. If the number of ships is small, the number of patrols is
simply reduced.

Takeda: At the end of each year, an estimate is made of what can be done with the

strength available and a report is made. we ultimately come to the conclusion that
nothing can be done without revising the defense guidelines. however, the govern-

ment has resolved not to revise the defense guidelines, so we are left frustrated.

It always ends in talk.

Kurisu: No adjectives, "limited" and "small-scale," are used. Originally, it
was one or the other. But the two terms were used to create the meaning of "a
size which we can handle one way or another." (laugh) All the chiefs of staff were
against this.

Takeda: Recently, discussion has finally -erged in the Diet about the number of
divisions and the appropriate number of aircraft to go with them. before it was
all very vague.

Question: While they use the word ”limited," the h‘ypotheticai enemy is the Soviet
Union, isn't it?

Kurisu: That's right.
Takeda: There is no limited scenario for it.

The Important Issue Is Determination

Uchida: There are also obstacles in the systa.

37
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

Takeda: Under the present systan, we cannot honestly do anything, can we? Even
with the surprise attack defense proposed by Mr Kurisu, under the present system,
we would be knocked out by the first attack, in 10 minutes, wouldn't we?

Kurisu: It is not only a problem of the system, it is a problem of the government's
determination. There are my things that are not particularly linited by law but
are simply not clearly specified.

Takeda: With respect to the emergency law system, if the Crowd Self Defense Force
wanted to take up s position when the enemy landed, it could not construct an ideal
position under the present systu. Also, aircraft would have to receive detailed
instructions from the Aviation Bureau before they could take off. This is ridicu-
lous. There are also restrictions on munitions under which so many meters of open
land must surround so many tons of explosives. These kinds of things met be changed.
They are a joke.

Kurisu: Going back to the basic defense capability concept, there is something
called "warning time," the tine for the government to evaluate the crisis. This is
the problem of how long before a crisis occurs we should make preparations. The
government says 1 year. There is no other country like this in the whole wide
world. Usually, this time is given in terms of weeks or hours. The production

of shells takes 13 months from the time the workers are collected and the asterials
have been imported, so they think that 1 year would be enough. This is foolish.

Uchida: In Europe, they think in terms of hours.

Takeda: The U.S. military are carrying out a plan for overseas procuraent of
equipment. They have placed enough for four divisions entirely in Europe. They
are planning to increase this to enough for six divisions by 1987. With this,
transport will be easy in an emergency. There is nothing like this in Japan. Even
if the United States cane to our aid, all the equipment would have to be shipped.
Japan does not have the capability for this.

Kurisu: Everything is theoretically prepared according to the defense guidelines.
It says that preparations are made sufficient for expansion in case of aergency.

Tskeda: Everything is just fine in writing.

Uchida: Essentially, it is set up so that we cannot tell that there is a crisis
until the shooting starts.

Kurisu: It is not even clear who the col-pander in chief of the Self Defense Forces
is. ' '

Question: Isn't it the chairman of the Joint Staff Council?

Kurisu: No, it's probably the prime minister or the director of the Defense Agency,
but it is not clearly determined.

Tskeda: It is probably the prime minister.

3 8
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
Kurisu: That is who starts a war, but it is not al all clear after that.
Takeda: Are you talking about the leader directly in charge?

Kurisu: Yes.‘ There is probably no other country like this. In most other countries,
the secretary of state takes charge or, ultimately, the president. This changes
once a war begins. But the system is not at all clear in Japan.

Takeda: It seems that the chairman of the Joint Staff Council will not be needed
once a war starts. (laugh) Ordinarily, there are laws which designate a joint
staff council and a chairman and provide what their duties shall be. We do not
have such laws. We look here and there and pick up things from various places
until we finally figure our what our duties are.

Kurisu: Originally the post of Joint Staff Council chairman was created at the
request of the United States. It was ordered to be established as a point of con-
tact for 0.8. troops stationed in Japan. The position was created without thinking
about its content. It was revised once, but the revision did not amount to much.

I interpreted the situation in the opposite way. Since there are no regulations
for the chairman's duties, I decided that I could do anything at all as long as I
had the trust of the Defense Agency director general. I could have a say in mili-
tary administration, military command, or personal. I actually told people above
me what to do on many occasions. '

Uchida: Even the prime minister cannot lake decisions on his own. He net present
everything to the cabinet. It is a strange situation if the cabinet is to determine
military strategy and provide nilitary leadership.

The Hilitary's Opinion Should Be Listened To

Takeda: We have been carrying out this defuse study since Mr Kurisu's era.

We could say that the military has done everything possible. If a conflagration
were to break out in the Middle East and lead to a world war, who (the government,
the Defense Agency, the troops, etc) could do what and when? And what should be
done? When we try to pin this dew, we find a lack of clear directives. In order
to make the necessary laws and regulations, we must work together with the govern-
ment. There are many things that aust be done. With all our efforts up until now,
we have f inally managed to present an interim report in this Diet session.

However, things will not go well without the cooperation of the various ministries
and agencies. In particular, this includes the laws I mentioned for controlling ex-
plosives and for traffic, public order, and aviation. Also, what can be done about
civil defense, which is not under the jurisdiction of any ministry or agency? Since
we are limited to defense. I believe we need to have some office in charge of air
raid warnings and evacuation of civilians.

Kurisu: The newspapers often report important meetings of the various ministries,
with cabinet ministers taking a leading role. This does not happen for the Defense
Agency. It did in the past, but the practice has gradually disappeared. The meet-
ings attended by the ministers are final budget report seatings and beer drinking
parties to celebrate the completion of something. (laugh)

Takeda: Once or twice a year.

Kurisu: A long time ago, important meetings were called by ministers. Even when
I was lower in rank, I had the opportunity of attending several of those meetings.

Takeds: Now, the only time it happens is at budget time and when a foreign minister

from another country is coming to Japan and we have to decide on our approach ahead
of time.

Kurisu: It is just a ceremony.

Uchida: Everything is taken care of in the councillors' meetings. I think the
director of the Defense Agency and the prime minister should listen more seriously
to the opinions of the military.

Takeda: Because it is peacetime, there are no difficulties in everyday administra-
tion. But if a military emergency arises, there will be a problem. Therefore,
even the defense study said that the chairman of the Joint Staff Council should be
given more authority. The emergency law system has many areas where the people's
individual rights are limited, so the Diet will have to debate the extent of these
limitations. however, an actual proposal must be made to see what the reaction is.

Government Consideration Desired

Kuriau: I once made a report to one Defense Agency director general on the overall
views of the Joint Staff Council concerning issues which we thought were very im-
portant to national policy. He said: "I understand. I actually agree. Otherwise,
Japan cannot survive in the future." however, he said that it would be impossible
to say this in public and he told me to burn the papers till there was nothing left
and he would forget he had seen them. That is how it went. (laugh)

Takeda: This is changing the subject a little, but in case of an invasion, it is
the Self Defense Forces which have to fight, right? And if we cannot win, it is
meaningless. I think that this major goal is being forgotten. Some civilians
think there is no reason to have jet fighter aircraft with speeds greater the

apeed of sound outside of training areas. This is a big mistake. In order to 9’0?
tect Japan, we must have fighters faster than the speed of sound and we must have
heavily armed aircraft as well.

Then what should be done? It is not necessary to have the training areas secured
by government authority? If the action taken by the government remains the same
so that there is no meaning in having these areas, we cannot achieve the objective.
We see the same inadequate concepts in both the defense guidelines and the overall
system.

Uchida: Recently, there was a report of a Self Defense Force vessel breaking a
fishing line. I would like to see the government take action so that such problems,
just like the training area problems, would not occur.

Kurisu: Also. we cannot fire our largest artillery.

Uchida: Ever since the crash of the Self Defense Force plane at Shisulnuishi, public
opinion has become more critical. It is difficult right now to conduct tr00p
movements because of complaints about noise pollutio .

Question: Let's go back to the theory of a crisis in the 1980's which we discussed

at first. There is a theory that as long as Japan maintains mar-med neutrality,
it can avoid a war, right?

Takeda: This is ridiculous. A valuable country like Japan will be taken over if
it stays unarmed and neutral.

Uchida: There will probably not be a war where only Japan is taken over. I

believe it will be a matter of how to dispose of Japan in the context of a world-
wide strategy. No one will devise a limited strategy whereby Japan alone is attacked
without using nuclear weapons. If it becomes necessary to take Japan on the basis
of an overall strategy, we will probably be invaded.

Tragedy of Iharmed Neutrality
Kurisu: It will be a matter of getting rid of a nuisance. (laugh)

Takeda: It is a big mistake to suppose that if the Soviet Union were to take over
while we are unarmed and neutral, a war could be avoided. Even herica is not that
nice. It would not just hand over Japan's economic and industrial power to the
Soviets. If a war began, Japan's geopolitical value would become more important
than those things.

Kurisu: Even if America did not destroy us, the war would not last forever. Even-
tually, peace would come. Then, although we would not have a different constitu-
tion, we would have to naintain an honorable position in world society. If we had
been taken without a fight, we would be made tools of by the Soviet Union.‘ America
and other countries would not recognize the existence of the Japanese.

In the previous war, Dmnark was almost put in that position. It was a first in
world history for a country to surrender within 4 hours. When the German warships
entered its northeastern territorial waters, not a shot was fired, even though it
had shore defense batteries. The authorities gave orders not to resist. I suppose
they thought that was best. Germany invaded Norway on the same day, but Norway
resisted for 2 months, so it received both material and moral support from the
Allies. Denmark was abandoned. Then Demark realized that when peace case, it
would be erased from the world map, so it began guerrilla resistance and set up a
government in exile.

Uchida: Japan would disappear as a country. The young people are total cowards, so
they would have to live as a subject people, without the self-respect to rebuild
their own country. '

Takeda: If Japan entered the Soviet bloc, it would not be able to trade freely.
It is questionable whether 100 million people would be able to live in this small
land.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENT STATUS OF ROBOT INDUSTRY OTULINED

Tokyo SHUKAN ORU TOSHI in Japanese No 651, 16 Jul 81 pp 12-13

[Text] Japan Is the World Leader in Robot Strength

The Japanese robot industry had its start with the introduction of technology from
the United States about 1965. This industry has since grown to the stage that at
present it is a representative mechatronics industry which places Japan as the
world's "robot ruler."

The production volume for 1980 was 78.6 billion yen and 19,700 units were produced,
and the Japan Industrial Use Robot Industry Association estimates that this produc-
tion will amount to 290 billion yen in 1985 and to 600 billion yen in 1990, and the
possibility of breaking the l-trillion-yen mark seems not too far away.

In the Western countries, as of March 1979, the number of robots on hand amounted
to 5,850 units in West Germany and 3,255 units in the United States--an order of
magnitude lower than the 67,000 units in use in Japan. A number of reasons can be
cited for this tardy situation on the part of the western countries.

Strengthen "Hishmash" of Technology

First of all, there is the difference in the makeup of the labor unions. Japan's
labor unions are intra-industry unions, and while the introduction of robots causes
changes in work assignments, it does not result in loss of jobs. In contrast, the
unions of the Western world are classified according to different occupations, and
the introduction of robots to welding and painting processes results directly in
loss of jobs for welders and painters. This is why there has been extremely great
opposition to the introduction of robots on the part of the workers. There was a

strike lasting 3 weeks at the Rosetown plant of the American as Company in February
1972. This is the famous incident known as "the Rosetown revolt," and the reason

it occurred was the taking over of welding operations by the "Unimate robot,"
causing worker dissatisfaction. This clearly illustrates the differences in the
manner of handling labor problems between Japan and the United States.

In the second place, there is the difference in the robot development system itself.
As indicated by the statement that a robot is a model mechatronics product, it is
a wedding of high-precision mechanical finishing technology and electron technology
centered on the micon. The micons, sensors, and actuators which are the important
constituent elements all involve technology that is not much different in America

#2

FOR OF?ICIAL USE ONLY

from that found in Japan, and there are some aspects where the Americans are decidedly
superior. The difference lies in the fact that the industrial area which encompasses
the "mishmash" of technology called mschatronics is greatly exploited in Japan. what

cannot be overlooked here is the presence of integrated electrical makers such as
hitachi.

For example, Hitachi is comprised of 27.plants with seven research laboratories
where research and development on heavy electrical equipment, light electrical equip-
ment, semiconductors. nuclear power plants, and small production technology are under
way. This means that all the technology directly tied in with robots is held by

this cne company, and this is an extremely convenient setup.

In this respect, representative American companies such as animation and Cincinnati
Hiracron are industries which belong to the machine industry family, and their
strength in electronics is limited.

As robots of higher performance (intelligent robots) are developed, it is the quality
of the software that is the soul of the control technology, more than the hardware
making up the robot which becomes subject to question. When that comes to pass,

even where a Japanese integrated maker is concerned, it will fall one step behind

if its control technology is weak. 0n the other hand, it is rumored that the
American giants of the computer industry, IBM and Texas Instruments, will enter this
market, and they may become a major threat in control technology just because of
their "capabilities."

Nevertheless, Japan has the stage to itself at the present time. In fact, the United
States, which has fallen behind in turning to the use of robots to man its welding
and painting lines, will be pushing its "rearmament" program for its production
lines, and the American companies headed by GM shOuld turn out to be a good market
for robots in the future. Looking at last year's figures, there was as yet very
little export of robots, but the Robot Industry Association is pointing toward an
export rate of 20 percent in 1985 and 25 percent in 1990.

When that comes to pass, there probably will not be the frictional problems such as
those that occurred following the torrential exports of automobiles and TV sets.

This is because while robots require onsite service and parts supply, they are mainly
a production commodity and are directly tied to "industrial secrets" such as altera-
tion in production lines by the introducing industry and production technology.

This alone presumes a relationship of trust between companies. Hitachi has bared
site plans to enter into OEM supply agreements with American automatic companies and
"gradually enter into onsite business."

Problems in Development of Intelligent Robots

The problem Japan, the "robot ruler," must face is the development of the intelligent
robot which is the next generation robot. The reason for the urgency in speeding up
development of this intelligent robot is the need to convert at least 25-30 percent
of the assembly processes to robots in order to rationalize production lines,
introduce conservation of labor, and enable realization of completely unmanned
operations. All assembly processes are not as uniform in their nature of work as

in welding, and the number of parts and work points will be much greater.

#3
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

For this purpose, the makeup of the robot need only imitate the upper limb section
of man (arms, wrists), but as the number of operations become greater and assemblies
become more involved, any number of arms and hundreds of wrists will need to be
involved in the application. In addition, the production line of the future will
handle mostly a varied array of products, and pattern recognition will head the

list of sensor technology, including recognition of sounds, voices and temperature.

At the present time. robots with assembly capability seems to be in the development
stage throughout the world. Some representative models include the "Puma" of the
American Unimation Company, of which the GM Corporation as the largest American
robot introducing industry hopes to "introduce 5,000 units" over the next 10 years.
This is a rather expansive hope, because at present there are at best 70 units in
the whole world. Even in Japan, the present situation is that one or two units made
by Kawasaki Heavy Industries are in the testing stage at some automobile makers.

Another problem remaining is how much line speed lost through introduction of sight
and touch capabilities of the robot in order for it to Judge and sense objects can
be restored. 0n the other hand, advances in robot technology are taking place every
day, and it is the general belief that the age of robots with actual assembly
capabilities will be coming in 2-3 years.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOWY

INDEPENDENT ACADEMY OF TECHNOWY PROPOSED

[Text] Academy of Technology to be Established Independent of Science Council;
Selection Comitte Assigned by Prime Minister; LDP Prepares Bill; Government Approves
Budget

The conflict between Director General Nakayama of the Prime Minister's Office and the
Science Council of Japan (Yasuji Fushimi, chairman; 210 members) has become a serious
problem. In the midst of this, the LDP Science and Technology Liaison Comittee

the academy is to promote a more active exchange between government, academia, and
industry for "original and innovative development of science and technology." The
selection committee in charge of recommending the chairman and mmbers of the academy
has been assigned by the prime minister, and financing is to be provided in equal parts
by the government and by industry. Therefore, the Science Council is already criti-
cizing this effort as "weakening the Science Council and threatening the independence
of science." This also relates to government educational policy and the textbook
problem, so it sears likely to cause debate.

"Ueakening of Science Council", "Interference in Science": Science Council Protests

came to the conclusion that "greater development of science and technology is necessary
to maintain and improve present economic growth in the future; Japan cannot survive
unless the country is built up on the basis of science and technology." As a specific
proposal, the comittee formed the plan for the Japan Academy of Technology.

also referred to the ideas of Dr Reona Ezaki, the Nobel Prize winner, for a technology
academy. The comittee held two meetings of subco-nittee chairmen at the end of last
month and listened to an explanation from Dr Ezaki, nowbIICk in Japan, about the
operation and performance of the American Academy. Finally, an outline for the bill
was decided upon as a subcouittee proposal.

46
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

According to the proposal, the purpose of the academy would be "to promote exchange and
mutual enlightenment of superior researchers and technicans involved in technology

and closely related scientific studies in academic, industrial, and government insti-
tutions, and to contribute to the progress of original, innovative technology through
research, analysis and evaluation of the possibilities of pioneering work in original
new technology." The bill calls for far-ranging cooperation between government,
academia, and industry in order to promote original research, said to be a weak area

of Japanese science and technology, and ’hstablish a system for proper evaluation" of
research results (according to an LDP source).

Academy members will be recommended by a selection committee (appointed by the prime
minister from people recommended by the committee chairman). They must: 1) be engaged
in technological research or work duties and 2) have published excellent research
papers related to technology or achieved superior results in technological work. The
members 9111 be appointed but must retire at the age of 60. (Council members must be

over 55 years of age.) Total funding will be 1.5 billion yen, half to be provided by
.the government and half by private industry.

The bill provides that "the academy shall maintain close communications with the Science
Council of Japan," presenting a scheme of coexistence with the Science Council. How-
ever, an LDP source who participated in the preparation of the bill emphasizes the
necessity of establishing the academy as follows: 'ﬁhe members of the present Science
Council are elderly and not very active. They present reports to the government only

a few timosa year. From the viewpoint of promoting scientific and technical develop-
ment, they do not function effectively." He recognizes that certain features of the
academy reflect dissatisfaction with the state of the Science Council. These include:
1) the method of selection (by recmmmendation; the Science Council members are elected),
2) a retirement age of 60 (there is no age limit for the Science Council), and 3)
stricter qualifications.

In preparing this bill proposal, the LDP committee consulted unofficially with the
government and obtained a basic agreement on the establishment of the academy.

The Science Council is strongly cautioning that "the government and the ruling party
are attempting to weaken the Science Council," earnestly renewing their attack in the
debate over the Science Council.

Reason for Existence of Department No 5--View of Yoshinosuke Yasojima, Head of Department
No 5 in the Science Council of Japan

"I have not seen the LDP proposal so I cannot say much at this stage. However,
Department No S is well aware of the importance of promoting science and technology

in Japan. Even if a new organization is set up, Department No S itself still has a
reason for existence. The field of technology is important, but is it not necessary to
think about the position of technology in relation to all academic fields?"

Serious Debate; Government Working Behind the Scenes

The "Japan Academy of Technology Bill," drawn up by the LDP on 1 September, has a very
strong political side.

An LDP source says: "In drawing up the hill, we consulted with director generals

Komoto of the Economic Planning Agency. Nakagawa of the Science and Technolgoy Agency,
and Nakayam of the Prime Minister's Office and obtained their approval for the sub-
stance of the bill." He admits that although this is referred to as an LDP proposal,

it is actually a government and LI)? preposal prepared with government approval. Specific
plans for establishing the academy are already fairly well set. For example, the 750
million yen which the government vill contribute to the total budget of 1.50 billion

yen will come fron the science and technology promotion coordinating expenses already
allocated to the Science and Technology Agency budget.

In spite of this, the LDP will Submit the bill to the Diet in the form of House member
legislation. This is apparently an attupt to avoid criticism of government interference

This method of approach by the government itself indicated that the goverment expects
the academy problem to arouse a fierce debate.

[Text] Improving Basic Research; Less Total Strength than Europe and the United States;
Recommendation Expected Soon from Long-Term Policy Research Committee for Industrial
Technology Development

The Long-Tenn Planning and Policy Research Committee for Industrial Technology Development
(private advisory organ to the chairman of the Industrial Technology Council of MITI;
committee chairman: Yujiro Hayashi, assistant director of the Future Technology Research
Institute) is making final preparations for a recommendation report on the "ideal state
of Japanese industrial technology development in the future,"to be completed by the
first part of October. The gist of the recommendation was announced on the 16th.
According tothis report, Japanese industrial technology, especially manufacturing tech-
nology, has attained a high international reputation at present, but there are many
areas where funding is lacking, beginning with basic research, and our overall strength
in industrial technology still lags behind the United States and Europe. Therefore

it advocates the following: 1) it is necessary for private industry to have an aware-
ness of its prime role in development and to expand its long-term research and develop-
ment capability in basic and general areas; and 2) the government should prepare the
environment to promote expansion of independent research and development by private
industry. The report warns that if this policy is not followed, "we cannot hope for an
improvement of the international competitiveness of Japanese industry as we look toward
the let century." HITI plans to accept this recommendation when it is completed and

use it in forming its future policy for industrial technology.

Private DevelOpment Capability Is the Key

The study committee made an interim report last year strongly urging the creation of the
"next-generation basic industrial technology development system" which HITI began under
a 10-year plan in 1981. It has offered timely advice on the state of Japanese industrial
technology development. and its recommendations have been conspicuously used in steering
industrial technology policy.

The present recommendation, as well as the interim report, considers the future of
Japanese industrial technology from an overall point of view.

Previously, the substance of recommendations referred to the relationship between
industrial research and development and economic progress, saying that improving the
capability for research and development had a role in strengthening the international
competitiveness of Japanese industry. Now it is saying that private research and
development is the key to maintaining our comparative international strength.

On this basis, it analyzes the Japanese research and development capability and
technological leve1,making international comparisons, and points out that Japan is
still in an inferior position in comparison with the United States and Europe,
particularly tae United States, in basic research and development. It also points
to a lag in overall technological strength.

Therefore, the committee holds that our industrial technology development capability
must be further expanded. In order to do this, it calls for a stronger coalition

between government and academia, with private industry taking the main role, and for
increasing private research and development spending, especially basic research
spending. Along with this it advises positive use of the universities.

The report also touches on future industrial technology, pointing to miniaturization
technology, information technology, and composite technology as three important trends.
It says that these three areas are undeniably important as major directions in thinking
in the research and development in all industrial fields and that the next-generation
basic industrial technology development already started is in line with these large
trends, defining them as nationally important areas of new technological develoment.

However, the report raises doubts about coming industrial technology development
depending too heavily on the government. It emphasizes the need for private industry

to be aware of its major role, selecting new research and development issues and working
on them with increased research and development capability.

As a recommendation to the government, it asks the government to take the role of
preparing the proper environment to promote more research and development to be performed
mainly by the private sector.

HITI emphasized the need to promote original technological development in a report
entitled "The Path To Building the Country on the Basis of Technology" in the "HITI
Policy Vision for the 1980's: drawn up in the spring of 1980, and raised the goal of
increasing the percentage of the GR? spent for research and development from approxi-
mately 2 percent at present to 2.5 percent in the mid-1980's and 3 percent by the end
of the 1980's. Early on, MITI emphasized the need to formulate a vision of technolog-
ical development to create a country founded on creative technology, a vision of the
path which technology should follow going into the 1980's and 1990's, and a proposal of
the technologies which should be emphasized. The present "recommendation" attempts

to do this.

MITI plans to accept the completed recommendation in the first part of October and use
it in formulating its industrial technology policies.

FURUKAWA EXPORTS OPTICAL FIBER CABLE T0 comm: GLASS WORKS
Tokyo GEKKAN KOHPUTA DAIJESTO in Japanese 10 Oct 81 p 84

[Text] It was revealed on the 5th that a large quantity of optical fiber telephone
cable has been exported to the u.s. market by Purukawa Electric Co LTD. The buyer was
the world'slargest glass manufacturer and the developer of the optical fiber-Corning
Glass Works (headquarters in the state of New York). It is a large-scale business
deal involving long-distance transmission optical fiber cables, 2,500 km in total
length. Efforts to export optical fiber cable to the United States by Japan's large
cable manufacturers was previously fruitless due to the barrier set up by the Corning
Glass Worka' patent. By establishing a supply route with the "creator" of the optical
fiber, Purukawa Electric appears to have taken a great lead over other firms in the
same business in developing the 0.8. market.

The current export of optical fiber cables to Corning Glass Works by Furukawa Electric
is believed to have been concluded in August. Although details of the business deal,
such as the size of the order, have not been made clear, the optical fiber cables are
believed to be of lZ-strand to (as-strand construction (cables containing 12 to 68
optical fibers). These optical fiber cables will all be delivered to Canada's largest
comunications machine manufacturer—~Northern Telemco--from Corning Glass Works.

A large quantity of optical cables will be used by Northern Telemco in its project
involving application of optical con-summations technology to the public comxnications
system, including telephone circuits, to be carried out in Saskatchewan Province in
central Canada. Furukawa Electric's optical fiber cables will supply 80 percent of the
total length of 3,200 km, or 2,500 km, of the project's cable requirement. These
cables will play and important role in this optical communications network that will
interconnect the telephone stations.

Corning Glass Works is the manufacturer which developed the first practical opital fiber
ll years ago. It supplies optical fibers to half the world’s market excluding Japan.
It is considered a "giant" in the optical connunications business, similar to IBM in the
computer business. This deal is the first time Corning Glass Works has purchased
cosmunicationa cable containing optical fibers from any Japanese manufacturer.

Corning Glass Works limits it production to optical fibers and is not considering the
manufacture of cable itself. The reason Purukawa Electric was selected for the large
purchase of optical fiber cable reportedly was because of Furukawa's good reputation in
cable manufacturing method, including its protective membrane technology, the strength

and quality of the construction and the overall performance. Also, since February 1977
Furukawa Electric has been the exclusive licensee in Japan of Corning Glass Works'
patents concerning optical fiber construction and manufacturing method. This strong
link was no doubt another reason.

Now that Purukava Electric has mde a breakthrough in exporting optical fiber cable to
the United States via Corning Glass Works in the form of an “indirect export," it is
believed that Furukava Electric will be able to cultivate a U.S. market without worrying
about the patent barrier posed by Corning Glass Works‘in the future.

At a time when the optical comunications business is .suddeniy taking off in the United
States, so that AT&T is sounding cut the four large cable manufacturers in Japan,
including Furukawa Electric and Sumitomo Electric, about large purchases of optical
fiber cables, it is quite probable that the Furukava Electric may make a clean sweep of
them all. (Nikkei Sangyo Shinbun 6 Aug 81)
