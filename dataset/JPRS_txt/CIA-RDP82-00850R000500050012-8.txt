[Article by correspondent Ogiso]

[Text] La Paz, 21 Feb—Bolivian Foreign Minister Gonzalo Alvarez recently granted
an interview to this reporter (correspondent Ogiso) at the foreign minister's
office in La Paz. ‘Ihe foreign minister said that despite the fact Bolivia main-
tains diplomatic relations with Taiwan and has no state relations with China.

"we attach importance to future prospects on the Chinese continent from an econonic
viewpoint, and we want to promote trade with China through the cooperation of
Japanese general trading comapnies." In reply to this reporter's question, he
said: "At present we are studying, as a basic natimal question. whether or not

to switch our diplonatic relations from Taiwan to China."

Bolivia is now under a ailitary rule headed by Army Lt Gen Gelso Torrelio. the
president. In its international payments in 1980, Bolivia sustained deficits of
as much as $6 billion due to a fall in the price of copper and other items. The
country‘s economy is in a bad situation with 70 percent of its export earnings
going toward the repayment of foreign debts. Despite these economic difficulties.
the United States and the European nations have suspended economic and technical
assistance since 1976 on the grounds that the Bolivian Government is repressing
the human rights of the Catholic clergy. For this reason the South American
country devalued its currency early this month by an enormous 76 percent, and the
rightist military regime is now trying to close in on China with its eyes open to
its future prospects.

[Article by Jorge Tinossi, special correspondent]

[Text] Managua, 25 Feb (PD—Brazilian Labour Party leader Leonel Brizola said
that when governments like the United States'make threats of intervention "the
Latin Americans have to take those threats as given facts."

The leader of the Democratic Labour Party of Brazil analyzed for PRENSA LATINA
some aspects of the meeting of the Permanent Comission of Political Parties
of Latin America (wPPPAL), recently closed in this capital, and the present
political situation in the continent.

Brizols, one of the COPPPAL's six vice presidents, proposed in the deliberations
that the 0.5. threats against the peoples of Central America and the Caribbean
should be mderlined in particular.

"This is the most burning and overruling problem at present in Latin America,"
he commented, and what is important is that organizations like COPPPAL take steps
not solely to denounce the problem.

The Brazilian opposition leader said that it is mainly a question of popularizing
"our warnings of the dangers of U.8. intervention. Because in the rain we must
count on our peoples to stop that aggression."

He indicated that in Brazil the popular sectors are carrying out intensive acti-
vities to publicize and explain the present situation in the Central American
and Caribbean region.

"We are going through historic tines when we cannot allow—he mderlineduthe
0.5. Government and the ruling oligarchic class in Latin America to isolate
Nicaragua as it has tried to do with Cuba."

Brizola underlined in particular the positive role of Mexico in this period and
the importance of the visit paid to Nicaragua by the Mexican president, Jose Lopez
Portillo. -

Moreover, he pointed out that the fact that the meeting of the comm. was held
in Nicaragua "means the reaffirnation of solidarity with the Nicaraguan people
and their Sandinist revolution."

RESULTS OF FIRST SOVIET-CUM LONG TERM ACCORD NOTED
Moscow FOREIGN TRADE in English No 1, Jan 82 pp 7-11

[Article by Vladimir Burnistrov]

[Text] Diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union

and Cuba, broken at? in l952. were resumed on
May 8. 1960. Trade and economic relations were re-
established almost immediately. The new social and
economic conditions, emerging in the young repub-
lic. demanded a radical change in the principles ap-
plied to the foreign trade policy, one of which was
all-round expansion of trade and economic iinlts
with the socialist community nations, the USSR in
particular.

Soviet-Cuban trade relations as they developed
gave rise to broadening economic. scientiﬁc and
technological cooperation that embraced all the ltey
branches of Cuba's national economy—sugar. nio
kel. agricultural, electric power. building and trans-
port industries.

A qualitatively new stage in economic coopera-
tion between the Soviet Union and the Republic of
Cuba began with the signing in February l976 of
the liist long-term trade agreement between the
two countries for a ﬁve-year period. The friendly
nations have progressed to long-term planning of
their economic relations and closer coordination of
their national economic development plans. More.

- the I976-l980 trade agreement, a major component
of the large trade and economic cooperation pro-
gramme, was of crucial signiﬁcance for Cuba to
fulﬁl its live-year social and economic development
plan.

sector due to the country's history and climate.
Underdcveloped industries prevalent in the pre-re-
t-olutionary Cuba, one-crop system in agriculture
and practically complete lack of fuel-power re-
sources predetermined the notable dependence of
Cuba's economy on foreign markets. Any develop
ing industry depends on import of machines, equip-
llicnl. industrial raw materials, energy carriers, etc.
Exports are no less important since Cuba ships
overseas more than 90 per cent ol its sugar and
practically all output of its mining industry and
many types of agricultural products. All in all about
30 per cent of its GNP is being sold on external
markets. '

The SovieoCuban Long-Term Trade Agreement
turned out to be a component part of Cuba's ﬁve
year plan of social and economic development for
1976-1980. Soviet machines and equipment. indus-
trial raw material. building materials, energy car-
riers and many other commodities supplied under
this agreement to a large extent determined the
growth rates and the very directions of develop-
ment taken by many branches of Cuba's national
economy.

Considering the ﬁve-year period as a whole the
goods exchange amounted to a considerable sum—
nearly 19.0“) million rubles. a nearly 2.7-fnld in-
crease as compared with the previous 1971-1975
period. The total goods exchange growth between
the USSR and Cuba for 19764980 reached almost
(>5 per cent. in 1980 the Soviet Union's export to
Cuba amounted to 2.288 million rubles. a twofold
increase as compared with 1975 although its import
from Cuba grew somewhat slower; in 1980 it rose
by some 37 per cent and was worth 1,978 million
rubles.

The Soviet Union's proportion in Cuba's foreign
trade successively increased during the ﬁveyear
period due to the Cuban foreign trade policy aim-
ed at curtailing to the maximum imports paid for
in convertible currency and at promoting ship-
ments from the socialist community countries, the

Soviet Union in particular. In 1975 the USSR acp
counted for about 48 per cent of Cuba's total trade.
in 1979—6813 per cent.

A reduction of the Soviet share in Cuba's foreign
trade to under 60 per cent in 1980 was brought about
by a number of natural calamities befalllng the
republic that year. particularly sugarcane and to-
bacco-plant diseases which caused a notable deciine
in shipments of sugar and other goods to the So-
viet Union.

in its turn the Republic of Cuba accounted for
$6 per cent of Soviet foreign trade in the 1976-1979
period and for a little less in 1980 owing to a no
table decline in Cuba's exports of certain goods
(mainly sugar).

rather stable. undergoing no radical changes. Pro-
portions of individual goods. including machines.
equipment and energy carriers, were raised some

in the total volume of deliveries were relatively

The above data indicate that sugar is the main
item in Cuban exports to the USSR and it is quite
natural that the volume of its supply and its price
level substantially determine trade balance between
the two nations. Sugar exports to the USSR grew
successively and reached 3.707.000 Ions in 1979. in
I980 they Were drastically reduced (2.647.000 tons)
mulling from a sharp drop in its production owing
to a sugarcane disease.

Citrus fruit imports from Cuba are continuously
increasing. While in 1975 they totalled only 16,500
tons. in [980 the Soviet Union imported already over
70.000 tons, a more than 4-fold increase over the
ﬁve years.

The l976-l980 long-term trade agreement was a
success due to the intensive work done by Soviet
and Cuban enterprises. suppliers of export goods,
and foreign trade and transport organizations in
both countries.

The high growth rates of trade between the two
nations were due in no small measure to favour-
able trade-policy conditions created at the beginn-
ing of the period under review and were aimed at
promoting comprehensive Soviet-Cuban trade and
economic relations.

The Soviet Union, guided by a basic principle
of political and economic cooperation among the
socialist community countries—the gradual draw-
ing together and equalizing of their economic levels.
employs in its trade and economic relations with
Cuba such advantages of cooperation as giving cre~
dits on easy terms, deferring payments and setting
preferential prices on major goods.

A new Long-Term Trade Agreement for 1981-
1985 between the USSR and Cuba was signed in
Moscow on June 26, 1981, by Nikolai PatolicheV.
Minister of Foreign Trade of the USSR, and R. Ca-
brisas Ruiz. Minister of Foreign Trade of Cuba.
The Agreement providea for a further increase (over
42 per cent as compared with the previous ﬁve-
year period) in goods exchange between the Soviet
Union and the Republic of Cuba. Their trade is to

reach 27,000 million rubles in the current ﬁve-Sriear
period.

The range of goods to be supplied will be sub
stantiallv enlarged. The Soviet Union will export to
Cuba various power-engineering and lifting equip-
Incrtl. trucks and cars, road-building machinery,
aircml‘t. vessels and marine equipment, metalcut-
ting lathcs. oil and oil products. rolled stock of fer-
rous and non-ferrous metals. timber. and fertilizers.
consumer goods. food and many other products.

The Republic of Cuba will ship raw sugar, nickel-
containing products, citrus fruit. tobacco goods, elec-
tronic products and a number of other commodities
to the Soviet Union.
APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000500050012-8

In the current five-year period the favourable
trade-policy will make the new Long-Tenn Trade
Agreement as successful as the previous one. Pre-
ferential prices of raw sugar and nickel-containing
products. shipped to the USSR, will remain the

- same during the current liveyear period. Moreover.
on the latter a higher price has been ﬁxed as com-
pared to the previous five-year period. Favourable
conditions have expanded as preferential prices
have been set on all kinds of citrus fruits. This
step has been taken within the CMEA framewark,
the Soviet Union was participating with the other
CMEA nations in a Long-Term Speciﬁc Programme
of Cooperation in developing the citrus fruit indus-
try in the Republic of Cuba. This programme pro-
vides for assistance to be rendered for substantial-
ly increasing the production of citrus fniit and its
export to the Soviet Union and other European
socialist nations participants.

All these arrangements provide favourable legal
and ﬁnancial foundations for carrying out the va-
rious obligations. Yet to accomplish the objectives
of developing mutual trade as stipulated in the
Longfl'erm Agreement of June 26, I981 means that
considerable difﬁculties must be overcome. The large
growth of Soviet-Cuban trade needs the under-
taking of several organizational and technical mea-
sures to further improve the mutual deliveries sys-

tem and solve transportation problems in the ﬁrst
place.

Practically all foreign trade cargoes between the
USSR and Cuba are shipped by the Soviet merchant
marine. Export and import shipments in 1980 alone
exceeded 18.1 million tons of which 10.4 million
tons were petroleum and petroleum products. Any
further increase in mutual trade volume depends
directly on the capacities of the merchant ﬂeet and
the port facilities of the Soviet Union and Cuba. At
the present time any growth of trade hits diﬁculty to
a certain extent through the low capacity of Cuba's
ports. inland road and railway transport. its lack
of storage facilities (oil storage, elevators and re-
frigerated warehouses in particular) and insufﬁcient
mechanization and automation of handling opera-
tions. Under these conditions importance should be
attached to the greater use of specialized vessels
and the use of container and palletized cargoes.

Expanded export of citrus fruit demands a sub-
stantial increase of Cuba's ﬂeet of refrigerator ships.

This problem can be eased through the wider use
of ‘Ro-Ro type vessels and other modern dry-cargo
ships with stronger ventilation. Experimental ship-
ments of citrus fruit in 1979 and 1980 made by the
Ro-Ro type vessels showed that they could ship an
additional 40,000 tons of citrus fruit in the Novem-
ber-March period each year, provided that the ves-
sels be properly and fully used.

The deliveries of citrus fruit can be greatly ex-
panded if the merchant marine's turnover is in-
creased through better cargo handling in and out
at the Cuban and Soviet ports.

More radical measures should be taken to ship
to Cuba the planned amount of crude petroleum
and basic petroleum products. in connection with
the supposed coming into effect oi an international
Agreement on Environmental Protection the ship-
ping of petroleum and petroleum products can be
only made by large tonnage oil tankers and that
necessitates remnstruction of Cuban ports and their
oil-distribution systems.

The new Long-Term Trade Agreement will con-
tribute a great deal to perfecting the trade and
economic relations between the Soviet Union and
Cuba. and to intensifying their trade and economic
cooperation; it will help carry out the decisions of
the 26th Congress of the CPSU and the Second Con-
gress of the Communist Party of Cuba.

[Text] havana, Feb 23 (PL)-The importance of the Pan-African News Agency
(PANA) in the spreading of a correct and truly image of the peoples of
Africa was highlighted here. '

A comentary carried by the daily GRANMA stated that the recent meeting of
the international program for the development of communication held last
month in Acapulco, Mexico, supported the carrying out of this project.

The PANA News Agency with headquarters in Dakar constitutes a kind of pool
of national agencies of nearly 50 countries of the African continent with

five regional centers of reception and distribution in Tripoli, Lagos,
Kinshasa, Khartoum and Lusaka.

The article states that the PARA News Agency requested $1.5 million which
were granted mostly by the states of the Persian Gulf.

The U.S. representatives to the Acapulco meeting stated their reserves on
the PANA News Agency because its constitutional principles claim that this

news agency will contribute to the liberation of the African people and
will keep a policy contrary to racism, apartheid, Zionism and all the
forms of exploitation and oppression.

To counteract this action the United States defends the private initiatives
and the transnationals of information and stated the purpose to carry out
parallel programs to those of the PIDC linked, with the agency for
international development aid and the private sector.

ture. and the rising demand on the
world market for citrus and pro-
cessed citrus products have been
principal factors behind the rapid
development of citrus production
in Cuba. Furthermore. the lncreas~
ing citrus production raises the
per capita consumption of both
fresh and procassed'citrus fruit
in Cuba as well as In the CMEA

member-countries. These factors
proved Instrumental for the elabo-
ration of a Long-Term Specific
Programme of Cooperation (LSPC)
to expand the production and ex-
port of citrus and the products of
their processing.

In compliance with the develop-
ment programme of citrus grow-
ing In Cuba. adopted In the mid-
1960s. citrus production is being
carried out in several zones.
Specialized citrus-growing farming
complexes have been set up In
western and central parts of Cuba.

Among the largest ones is the
farming complex Victoria de Giron

in the Matanzas province where
the soil and climatic conditions are
very favourable for the growing
of citrus. Hera substantial re-
serves of subterranean waters are
available and being used for In
rigstlon. The farms of citrus planta-
tion occupy an area of about 30
thousand hectares. By the and of
1990 the citrus-growing area is ex-
pected to be increased up to 80
thousand hectares. From 1978 to
1919 the citrus harvest in this
region rose from 32.4 thousand
tons to 58.4 thousand tons.
Another large citrus farming
complex ls Camila Cienluegos on
Youth island. The area occupied by
curus crops here amounted to 34
thousand hectares in 1979. The soil
and climatic conditions are par-
ticularly favourable for grape-
fruit. Plans are already In hand for
increasing the citrus-growing area
up to 45 thousand hectares by
1990.

Guane Mantue is the name of
a citrus farm In the Pinar del Rio
province. Its citrus-growing area
amounts to about 14 thousand hec-
tares. in the near future it is to
be significantly expanded with new
plantations and by 1990 citrus
crops will be grown here on about
65 thousand hectares.

The setting up of specialized
citrus-growing farms ls helping
material and labour resources to
be utilized rationally and bring
about the centralized processing
and packaging of citrus fruit. De-
velopment of these regions is a
complex process: roads are being
built. citrus processing plants are
being set up. refrigerator facilities

erected. and ports and new
mechanized sea terminals con-
structed.

The total acreage of citrus

plantations in the Republic of Cuba
amounted to 117.0 thousand hec-
tares in 1980. including 60.9
thousand hectares occupied by
young. yet non~bearing plantations.
Most of the new plantations were
sown In the first half of the 1970s.

About 60 per cent of the total is
occupied by orange trees. 25 per
cent by grapefruit. 10 per cent by
lemon and lime.‘ five per cent by
mandarin orange.

I Urns — citrus varieties with small
fruit. limes. used to males concentrated
prices. citric acid and ethereal oil.

Citrus output increased sig-
nificantly when the new large
citrus-growing plantations entered
the fruit-bearing stage. In 1980.
compared to 1971-1975. citrus
production rose 60 per cent to a
total of ‘40 thousand tons. Be~
tween 1916 and 1980 citrus output
on average rose 10 per cent an-
nually. Effective measures are now
In hand to increase the yield of
citrus crops. which today amounts
to six-eight tons per hectare.
Cuba's specialists are planning to
raise the yield up to 10-14 tons
per hectare by 1985 by Introducing
advanced agrotechnical methods.

Cuba's soils and climatic condi-
tions are particularly favourable for
growing grape-fruit. Cuban brands
of grape-fruit as to quality. are
rated second to none in the world.
The pink-pulp variety successfully
competes with Ruby Red. the beat
us brand.

Plans envisage the area occu-
pied by citrus crops to be Increas-
ed up to 160.8 thousand hectares
by the end of 1985. with all the
trees reaching the fruit~bearing
stage by 1990. As much as 90 per
cent of citrus fruit in 1985 will
be harvested at the citrus planta-
tions which are parts of the large
specialized farm complexes exist-
Inc today.

Development of the citrus-pro-
cessing Industry in Cuba has lust
started. In 1979 as much as 32
thousand tons of lulces were pro-
duced In the country. The Cuban
nrape-fruit lulca. the Zun-Zun
brand. was awarded the Gold
Medal at exhibitions in Czecho-
slovakia and Bulgaria. Juice pro.
duction Is being carried out
principally at three processing
enterprises. one of them being the

Libertad plant in the Matanzas pro-
vince. Oranges and mandarin

oranges are processed at a rate
of 10 tons of juice per hour. The
Jesus Menendez plant in the
Oriente province turns out three
tons of juice per hour. In 1979 an
agro-Industrial complex for process-
ing citrus on Youth island was
completed. This is the first com-
plex and a prototype of other
citrus-processing establishments
now being built in Cuba. The com-
piex‘s storage facilities border a
deep-water canal where small ves-
sels can be loaded. The industrial
complex. its structures. shops.
working zones occupy an area of
about 100 thoust sq.m. The corn-
plex consists of the fresh fruit
packaging facility (20 tons per
hour). a metal cans producing
plant (250 cans a minute) and Juice-
meking production lines (12 tons
per hour].

Production wastes—skin and
pulp—are processed at the fod-
der-malting plant equipped with a
grinding device made in Bulgaria.
The area occupied by the indus-
trial complex and its potential
capacity permit further expansion
of production. in 1980 the complex
processed as much as 20 thousand
tons of citrus. lts output includes
concentrated juices. ethereal oil.
jams. confiture. A new production
line for tomato-paste and fruit proc-
essing was set up at the com-
plex at the end of 1980. Work is
continuing on producing juice from
the pulp of citrus and other fruit
(bananas. guava. mango).

Alongside the rapid increases of
the production of citrus and proc-
essed products. the citrus exports
from Cuba are developing fairly
quickly. In 1975 they amounted to
65 thousand tans. in 1979—161
thousand tons. in 1980—200 thou-
sand tons. The share of citrus fruit
in total exports of fresh fruit rose.
in terms oi cost. from 18.6 per cent
in 1958 to 77.7 per cent in 1976.

Oranges account for the largest
proportion of total citrus exports.
However. because of changes in
the production pattern. the share
of oranges in total citrus exports
progressively declined from 79.8
per cent in 1971 to 63.4 per cent

in 1976 and 60 per cent in 1990.
This is mainly due to a rise in
grape-fruit exports from Cuba in
the past twenty years. the reason
being a greater demand for grape-
fruit on the world market and Its
output has been increased to cope
with this. in the early 1970s the
share of grapefruit in citrus ex-
ports was 28 per cent. in 1976—
385 per cent. in the future. as
planned by Cuban specialists. its
proportion in total citrus exports

The Soviet Union is a maior
consumer of Cuba's citrus. In the
Tenth FiveYear~Pian Period Cuba's
citrus deliveries to the USSR in-
creased more than threefold.
Plans for the 11th Five-Year-Pian
Period provide for futher increases
in citrus exports from Cuba.
Oranges account for more than 90
per cent of the total citrus volumes
delivered to the USSR. Citrus da-
liveries are handled by Soviet
refrigerator ships. Experimental
citrus shippinge aboard dry-cargo
vessels outfitted with forced
ventilation systems are now under-
taken to secure timely shipments
of Cuba's fruit.

Preservation of citrus fruits be-

cerning citrus transportation are
being studied starting from the

Citrus growing Is one of the
spheres of cooperation between
the Republic of Cuba and CMEA
member-countries conducted on a
multilateral and bilateral basis. Ex-
tremely Important to the progress
of Cuba's citrus Industry Is the
Long-Term Specific Programme of
Cooperation in the field of agri-
culture which the 32nd CMEA Ses-
sion adopted in 1918.

The CMEA member-countries
are the principal buyers of Cuban
citrus and processed citrus pro-
ducts placed on the foreign market.

[Text] Havana, 18 Her (PD—Cuba expressed satisfaction for the efforts
being carried out by the PAIGC [African Party for Independence in Guinea
and Cape Verde] and the government of Guinea Bissau to realise the tasks
which encouraged the long struggle against the Portuguese colonial donina-
tion under the leadership of Anilcar Cabral.

In a Cuban-Guinean communique published at the end of the visit to this
country of the Guinean President Jose Bernardo Vieira, the Cuban side ratified
the firm and mahakeble support that its people, the PCC and the government
of Cuba give to the people, the PAIGC and the govermsent of Guinea Bissau in
the consolidation of its conquests and in the defense of its sovereignty and
independence. When analyzing the situation in Africa--the docunent stated—
both parties reflected the identity of viewpoints regarding the current
problens now affecting that continent.

When referring to the process of Namibia, they both denomced the delays in
the application of the UN Security Council Resolution 4235 stating the
modalities acceptable for a negotiated independence of that territory,
illegally occupied by South Africa.

The two parties expressed theri support to the ANC [African National Congress]
engaged in a struggle against apartheid in South Africa -and denounced the
supply of nuclear arms to that country by the Western powers.

Cuba and Guinea-Bissau denounced as well the South African aggression of
Angola and demanded the unconditional withdrawal of the Cuban presence in
Angola. [Sentence as received]

The delegation from Guinea-Bissau expressed its recognition to Cuba for its
internationalist support to Angola, at the request of the HPLA-Party of Labor
and of the Luanda Government, for its efforts in the reconstruction and
national safeguarding of the national unity, sovereignty and territorial
integrity, to its confrontations with the continual South African racist
aggressions.

They reiterated their support to the Polisario Front and to the government
of the Saharan Democratic Arab Republic in its just struggle to exert its
right to self-determination and independence and denounced Horocco's delaying
maneuvers seeking to perpetuate the occupation of that country.

17 Mar 82

[Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Her (IMO—In statements made here today, Salvadoran
Ambassador to Argentina Col Carlos Figueroa Vanegss admitted that his country
is receiving military aid which consists of arms as well as foodstuff from
Argentina and Venezuela. He also regretted that the recent statements ads
by U.S. Secretary of State Alexander liaig had "been distorted" since the aid
granted does "not consist of men" nor does it represent-~from his point of
view-intervention.

The ambassador stated that "we are receiving concrete aid (from Argentina
and Venezuela) but "the mfortmate thing is that they try to distort this
type of declaration (Haig's) at a political level and always convert political
aid into military aid with the supply of men and this is very harmful for us."

In statements made during the program "Magdalena and the News" of Radio
Continental, the ambassador stated: "We place emphasis on our statements
that the military aid by no means represents an intervention with sun,
therefore Baig's statements are in keeping with reality, so long as his
statements are not distorted."

Further on, in answering a question as to whether "Argentina and Venezuela
have granted both military aid and other aid, such as the supply of food-

stuff," Colonel Figueroa pointed out that "we are receiving both types of
aid."

During his lengthy telephone conversation with the radio station the
astassador stated that Francisco Hanrique has been invited as Argentine
observer because "of his moral virtues, which are undeniable, his democratic
background and his high civic-'mindedness, as is demonstrated by the fact
that he gave a prompt and decided answer to our invitation."

The ambassador asserted that "a person with those virtues combined with his
political background, is undoubtedly capable of giving an unbiased and
impartial opinion on the elections to be held in El Salvador." Figueroa
stated: "We need that just opinion to show the world that our government,
by making such a dangerous move. with the risk of paying for it with the life

of more Salvadorans who may be killed by the terrorists, is only encouraged
by the ideal of pacification and the search for democracy through civilized

means."

lie then asserted that "Hr Hanrique is the person with enough moral, civilian
and political virtues to give that opinion." [Passage indistinct]

He stated "that there is a lot of talk about the extreme right and extreme
left terrorism, but in general terms, although this is true, what we are
really enduring is not only terrorism but practically an invasion of an
ideology foreign to ours, which is known as Maradst ideology" and asserted
that it comes "fron Cuba encouraged by the Soviet thion."

Further on Colonel Figueroa pointed out that "we do not believe we are going
to put an end" to the guerrilla groups with the elections because "we are
not all that naive," but that "we will be able to change the minds of certain
countries that now support international terrorism."

After asserting that the future of the entire continent is at stake in El
Salvador, he said that two political parties have not joined in the elections
because "right Eros the beginning they maintained that the elections would
be a fraud" and that "their lives were in danger because they would be
murdered."

he then wondered "whether anybody's life in El Salvador was safe" and ended
by stating that ”there is no censorship in my country at present" because the
understanding of all the democratic comtries of the world is sought."

MILITARY WUNCIL DECLARATION 0N UNSUCCESSFUL COUP
PAl90035 Havana PRBLA in English 2320 941' 18 Mar 82

[Text] Paramariho, 18 Mar (PD—The ruling National Military Council of
Suriname accused those responsible for the abortive coup of being criminals
and declared that they sought to cause a bloodbsth in the country. The
declaration countered a statement by the Comittee of artistian Glurches

of Suriname that described as an "outbreak of violence" the measures adopted
by the government to confront the abortive 11 March takeover bid.

The comittee also expressed its "chagrin" at the execution of former Sergeant
Major Wilfred Hawker, one of the ringleaders of the coup attempt, after
trial by a court martial.

The National Military Council explained that the responsibility for the
present state of emergency must be borne by criminal elements whose objec-
tive was the overthrow and elimination of the revolutionary leadership without

con templatione .

Former rightving military and some civilians from well to do economic sectors
appear involved in the takeover scheme which for several hours occupied the
Hemre Boekoe garrison, the comtry's main army facility.

The Comittee of Churches should take into account the fact that the plans
to wipe out the revolutionary leadership included a bloodbeth during a
religious ceremony, recalls the statement.

The text refers to a plan of the com makers to liquidate the members of the
Military Council in the course of a meeting in a Paramaribo church to which
they had been invited.

"The military authority had to prevent that in order to defend the revolu-
tionary process that began on 25 February 1980," it adds.

Finally it reconnends that the church "take care that it is not infiltrated
by enemies of the people and that it act according to its preaching on unity
and the improvement of the living standard of the populace."

in the direction of. the jungle zone in western Suriname on Friday when
forces loyal to the government of the National Military Conneil headed by
Lt Colonel Desi Bouterse ousted the coup makers from the Hemre Boekoe
garrison. the country's main fortress.

Also heading the Coup bid was former Sergeant Wilfred Hawker who was tried
and sentenced to death by a court martial. He'was executed on the morning
of 13 March.
