This training . .mual examines, on the basis of Soviet and foreign literature, the
fundamental problems associated with the chemical thermodynamics of eowustion and
explosion-«nary release, the composition of combustion products and the thermo-
dynamic characteristics of fuels and the products of their chemical conversion. It
provides simple methods for calculating thermodynamic variables required for assess-
ment of the effectiveness of explosion processes, the danger of spontaneous com-
bustion or explosion and the quantity of toxic products formed by cowustion and
detonation. Special attention is devoted to the state equation fortbeinitial
substances and explosion products at high temperature (thusands of degrees--and

ultrahigh pressureuhundreds of thousands of atmospheres).

the principal unique feature of combustion processes--that which predetermines their
technical applications and the danger of spontaneous fires and explosions-13 the
release of a significant quantity or energy. Hence follows, in particular, the
primary significance of the thermodynamic aspects in the study of these processes.
At present, however, there are no training manuals which might examine the theoreti-
cal problems ot combustion and explosion thermodynamics and the methods of calcula-

ting the principal thermodynamic variables :rom the standpoint of the requirements

of institutions of. higher education specializing in chenical technology. Some books
dealing with these problems, for example the remnrkable textbook written by Andreyev
and Belyayev (l) , have long been a bibliographic rarity while others are too voluminous

and difficult or fail to satisry our instruction programs.

The purpose of this training manual is to correct this situation. In addition to
examining the comonplace thermodynamic relationships and simple calculation methods,

it devotes significant attention to one of the most ilportant problems of the theory
of explosive transformationwthe state equation for matter at high pressure--tens
and hundreds of thousands of atmospheres. In the final analysis the objective is

to make it possible for every process engineer to calculate the composition and other

characteristics of the products of chemical reactions occurring at high temperature
and ultrahigh pressure, something which is now within the means of only a few special-
ists having access to expensive computer technology (2). Some particular paths of
solving this problem are already known, and they are described in this book. He will
probably not have to wait long at all for someone to arrive at a general solution
similar to that reached for combustion processes at moderate pressure (3,4). Perhaps
some of the students for whom this guide is intended will themselves be able to take

part in reaching this solution.

1. Concentration. Stoichiometric Relationships

 

In physics, the principal characteristic describing the concentration of a substance
in a given point in space is density p (kg/m3). 'lhe reciprocal, V-l/p, is called
the specific volume. If the substance is an individual chemical compound, the pro-
duct Viﬂi (ma/mole) is its molar volume. Here. Vi-l/pi is specific volume and M;

is the molecular weight of substance 1: (kg/mole).

NR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
In chemistry. concentration C is usually given as the nurber of particles (molecules,
atoms, radicals, ions) per unit volume (l/m3, moles/m3, moles/liter). There are

other ways of expressing concentration involving simple relationships of p, V and C"

*A convenient way to check the correctness of tormlas (Ln-(1.4), or formlas
similar to them, is to consider the units of measurement pertaining to a given
component of a mixture of substances. Pollowing reductions, the units of measure-
ment must be in the right combination. Pb: exasple for fonaula (1.1), [gt] “mi/kg-

Relationships (1.6) are always satisfied for mixtures of ideal gases . It would not be

difficult to note that the sums 291;, tau; and to“ in relation to all components of

the mixture are equal to unity. obviously g and a may also be expressed as percents.

When we use the theory of combustion and explosion to solve thermochemical problems,
first we usually determine the elementary (elemental) oomosition of the mixture.

In this case the concentration of element '33 is deteuined in moles/kg by the formula:
”if Z 9i g} '5 ‘71“ (1.7.;

where aj is the number of atone of the given elenent in the molecule of compound j
(3=C, O, H, N etc., moles/mole). Sta-nation is performed in relation to all compo-
nents of the mixture. The variable gj/Mj -nj represents the number of moles of the
given compound per kg of the mixture. 0n calculating the amount of all [symbol

omitted; possibly n3] elements of which the mixture consists, we get the "empirical
formula" for the mixture:

°n¢°qum3
the molecular weight of which is 1 kg.

Most systems capable of combustion and explosion contain a fuel and oxygen. The

ratio between these ingredients is an inportant characteristic of the systen. Several

ways of expressing this ratio are commonly employed in engineering.

In the case of secondary explosives, the best suited variable is the oxygen balance

(K6) , expressed as a percent by weight. It is the difference between the quantity of
oxygen contained in the system and the quantity necessary for oomlete conbustio --

that is. for transformation of all carbon into 002, all hydrogen into H20, all

aluminum into 31203 and so on. If halogens such as chlorine or florine are present

in the system it is believed that they interact with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides.

Coefficient 1.6/3! in this formula is obtained by dividing the molecular weight of

oxygen (0.016 kg/mole) by the molecular weight of system H and multiplying it by

100 so that the result would be a percentage.

The oxygen balance of a mixture is an additive function of the oxygen balances of
its components. we can easily persuade ourselves of this by suing the products
90-)“ and applying formula (1.7). The oxygen balance of the mixture would be less
than zero if there is not enough oxygen in it for couplets oxidation, and greater

than zero if excess oxygen is present. For a system that is “balanced in relation

to oxygen," K6 - 0.

'me coefficient of excess oxidant, ao,'is the ratio of the quantity of oxygen in the
system and the quantity needed for complete combustion. For the purposes of this
handbook, in our calculation of so we will consider only the amount of oxygen re-
maining following combustion of aluminum to A1203 and Mg to Mao, and we will consider
only carbon and excess hydrogen (following its interaction with halogens--chlorine
and fluorine) as the combustible substances. The formula for calculating so would

have the form:

2. Motions of State. Some nelationshi s

the equilibrium state of a closed thermodynamic system in which the effects of
electric and magnetic fields are ignored, is characterized by five parameters or
functions of state. These are pressure ”, volume V, temperature T, m energy E
and entropy S. They are related to each other by a fundamental thermodynamic rela-
tionship:

a”; ' ”5'73"" (2.1.)

T and P are 'intensive"--that is, they do not depend on the quantity or the substance
within the system. V. E and S are comonly said to be 'extensive'udirectly propor-
tional to the quantity of the substance.‘ Bonaver, inasmch as these variables are
in all three terns 0! equation (2.1). this equation would also be valid if we assme
V, E and S to be 'intensive"--that is, if we represent them in relation to a mole

or unit mass of the substance. As a rule we will henceforth use the relative values

of V, S and S (in relation to 1 kg of the given substance).

 

‘It would be easy to memorize that f and Tare “intensive“ variables by using the
terms “intensive heating“ and “intensive pressure“ (though of course the latter tern
is sooner political than technical).

FOR OFFIGAL USE ONLY
Besides equation (2.1), which is lost general in nature, to describe a system we
usually use another equation of state—the functional relationship between three (or
(our) of the variables listed above, characterizing the given concrete substance (or

mixture of substances).

To make the calculations simpler we introduce another three tunctions of state:

Bnthalpy ("thermal function”) u . s . pw’ 3; . NS . yap (2,2)
Gibbs' energy“ 6 u n - 15; d6 u-Sdr o vdp_ (2.5)

Variables E, H, G and P are called the thermodynamic potentials: Under certain condi-
tions (under which the appropriate potential is a characteristic function) each of.

then determines the naxinum work of the system.

In order to fully define the therlodynanic state of a system, seeming we have the
equation of state and the four fundamental relationships (2.1-2.4). we must know
three of the eight parameters listed above: for the sake of detiniteness they would
best be in combinations which would transform thermodynamic potentials into character-
istic functions: (B,V,S), (H.P.S), (G,T,P), (F,2'.V). In view of the fact that under
experimental conditions we .are far from always able to deteruine precisely those
Emotions which are needed at the given nascent, and also because we lust often deal
not with the functions themselves but only with their derivatives, nuaerous relation-
ships were obtained between functions and derivatives in the course of the develop-
ment of thermodynamics. These relationships now sake up the essence of the mathemati-

cal toundation of this science. Sons of these relationships are given below.

Performing similar operations with equations (2.2-2.4) we get another six relation-
ships identical in form to (2.5), and then another three Maxwell equations. These
equations associate the derivatives of entropy in relation to pressure and volume
with the derivatives of value and pressure in relation to temperature. We write

then in general (though perhaps soeewhat unusual) torn:

" (mgr v ' 3%); (3;); {5}"; s (2.7.)

In each of these equations there are tour subscripts. which are used in pairsneither
the upper or the lower ones. Considering the symetry of the subscripts and ot the

variables, equations of form (2.7) are easy to sunrise.

It follows from equation (2.14) that pressure may be represented as the sum of two

couponents--thermal T(3P/ 31') y and elastic, -( aE/a V) 1'.

At absolute zero the thermal component of pressure disappears, with only the elastic
component remaining. 111. dependence of elastic pressure (or elastic energy) on

the specific voltne of a substance at f-O'K is called the zero isotherm. According
to Nernst's theorem (the third law of thermodynamics)at 1-091: entropy is zero-
that is, it remains constant. Therefore the zero isotherm coincides with the

zero adiabat (isentrope) .

At absolute zero -(3E/3V)T is called the “cold pressure" and represents the elastic

or potential component of the forces of interaction between the particles of which

the substance consists; it depends only on specific volume:

The values for internal energy, enthalpy, entropy and specific heat for all of the
basic products of combustion and explosion (obtained by analysis of spectroscopic
data and other means) are collected tagether in handbooks (3) and (4). Tables of
combustion product enthalpy and entropy values may be found in handbooks, for
example in the fundamental handbook (3). Enthalpy values are given for an interval
between 293.15 and 6,000 °K, with the value at 293.15'R" being 0. Inasuuch as for
an ideal gas AH-AE+R(T-To) , it is easy to obtain the value for the internal energy

3. The Etion of State

3.1. An Ideal Gas

Before writing the equation of state for an ideal gas--one of the fundamental laws
of nature*--we will examine partial gas laws from which it was obtained. These
laws were obtained as a result or physical measurements made over a period or
about two centuries, and as we know, they are of interest on their own. We will
adhere not to the chronological but to the logical sequence of presentation and

to the connonly accepted modern terminology.

l. Delton's law (John Dalton, 1766-1844): The pressure of a mixture or several
nonreacting gases is equal to the sun of the partial pressures of each of these

gases.

'It would be interesting to note that despite the fact that this law is so funda-
mental, the equation of state for an ideal gas is purely approxilate. tron this
standpoint this is a typically technical or technological law. Incidentally it
does enjoy broad use in engineering.

 

21

roe omcw. use ONLY
2. Law of multiple proportions (Prout, 1799; Dalton. 1808): Voluees of gases

entering into a reaction relate to one another as enall whole nubers.

3. Avogadro's law (Anadeo Avogadro, 17791856): Equal values of gases at the

sane temperature and pressure contain the sane umber of molecules (at given P and 1',

the nolar volunes of all gases are equal).

4. The Boyle-Mariotte lav (Doyle, 1662; Hariotte, 1616): At constant temperature.
the pressure of a certain ms of gas is inversely proportional to the value or the

gas.

5. The Gay-meal: lav (Joseph Louis Gay-basalt, 1778-1850): At constant pressure,

the volume of a gas is proportional to its absolute telperature.

6. Charley law (1787): At constant volune, pressure is directly proportional to
the absolute teeperature or a gas (a different interpretation is: ‘me pressure of
a certain mass of gas, when heated 1°C at constant volume, increases by 1/2736 of

the pressure at 0°C).

Let us write laws (4), (5) and (6) for 1 mole of a gas:

3.3. Gases at Ultrahiﬁ Pressure and Condensed Substances

One shortcoming of all of the forms of the equation of state given above is that
they do not contain the cold and elastic components of pressure and intrinsic
energy. In all cases except (3.13), at T-O pressure becomes zero independently
of Vcnthe specific volume or the substance. But the theory of the structure of
matter indicates that at absolute zero, pressure and intrinsic energy are functions

of volume, and when the latter changes (especially when it decreases) they change

a very great deal.

when a substance is heated, it undergoes thermal expansion: Thermal pressure,

which is always assmed to be positive, arises. Elastic pressure becomes negative

The derivation of the equation of state or a condensed substance (9) is based on

the following premises.

If tenperature is not too high the atom: of a solid are locked within cells torned
by their closest neighbors, and they make har-onic oscillations relative to their
equilibrium positions. Exit tron such a cell would require surnounting a potential
barrier equal in order of magnitude to the substance's energy of evaporation or
sublimation. For many substances this energy corresponds to an increase in taper-

In this case the properties of a liquid begin to approxi-ate those of a solid.
Thus atoms continue to make harmonic oscillations over a broad interval of pressures

OD in (3.32) is found as a reducing parameter from the experimental dependence of

heat capacity on temperature (see Appendix 5 in (5)).

Another way for calculating OD requires interpretation of a crystal as an elastic
isotropic medium. An isotropic solid has two coefficients of elasticity--the
compressibility coefficient 82' and Poisson's constant on. The speeds of sound 01

Cgstals Consisting of Molecules

The formulas of Debye's theory may be applied directly only to crystals consisting
of atoms of the same sort. If a crystal consists of N molecules, each with 8 atoms.
then in addition to 3” oscillations distributed as per Debye's theory, to describe
the state of the crystal we would have to add 311(6-1) oscillations associated with
the internal degrees of freedom of the molecules (it is usually assumed that notion
within molecules and relative motion of molecules within the crystalline lattice

do not depend on each other). We will interpret internal degrees of freedom as
sinple harmonic oscillations of the same frequency, and correspondingly we repre-

sent their contribution as Einstein's statistical sun:

account for the anisotropy typical of crystalline substances or the relatively

high mobility of particles in a fluid. As was noted earlier, the latter becomes
less significant at high pressure, which li-its the nobility of particles so much
that the state of both a liquid and even a gas could be described by equations such
as (3.30) and [equation nutter illegible; possibly (3.38)]. we will henceforth need
only these two equations. A reader wishing to acquaint himself with the equation

5. anthalpy of Formation

Besides the equation of state . the equilibrium constants and the dependence of
intrinsic energy or enthalpy on temperamre, to calculate the thermodynamic relation-
ships in combustion and explosion products we need to know the enthalpy of formation
of the initial substances and the reaction products. The enthalpies of formation
of organic compounds--the principal ingredients of conbustible and explosive
systems--are obtained mainly by measuring the heats of combustion reactions in

a calorimetric bomb. Values obtained in this fashion are tabulated in handbooks
(3.6.12). Some of the values used most often are given in the Appendix in (5).

At the same time in View of the tremendous diversity of organic coupounds on one

hand and the comlexity and high cost of reliably determining enthalpy of formation

on the other, methods of calculating this variable are under intensive development.

All existing methods of calculating enthalpy of formation , as well as a number of
other thermodynamic variables (entropy, Gibbs' energy, specific heat), are based on
the principal of additive contributions by groups and bonds. Table l in the
Appendix compares some methods in application to a number of organic substances,

as studied in a degree project conducted by I. Ye. Esterman (1977). It also gives
the ; :sults of his calculations for group contributions obtained by Ester-an and

V. M. Reykova from an analysis of formerly published experimental values of

Mf. These contributions are brought together in tables 7 and 8. Table l in the

of those published to date. Its advantage lies in the possibility of obtaining

AHf both for gases and for liquids and in the great assortment of contributions by

functional groups.

In the case of compounds with several functional groups, the action of the groups

upon one another must be accounted for. Groups exhibiting strong interaction are
separated in Table 8 frat those exhibiting weak interaction. ‘lhe effects of group

interaction in arontic compounds are described in Table 9.
Nitrogroups interact with one another especially strongly.

The increase in enthalpy of fornation associated with presence of two or more
nitro groups in the sans molecule should also be accounted for in calculations
associated with the aliphatic series. It has been noted in this case that the
interaction effect, which expresses itself as growth of Mf that is greater than
can be explained by "additive“ growth (as calculated using the data in Table 7),
weakly depends on the aggregate state of the substance (be it a gas or a liquid).
but it decreases intensively as the N02 groups move farther apart. For neighboring
nitro groups the interaction effect is 16-20 kj per paired interaction. while for
crosswise nitro groups attached to neighboring carbon atom [C(N02)-(ll2-C(N02)]

the interaction effect is about 6 kj. Nitro groups that are farther apart parcti-

cally do not interact with each other (MAHFO: 1 1:3 per paired interaction).

Characteristics of eosbustion and B_xplosion troducts

6.1. Statement of the Problem

The main problem of thermodynamic calculation is to determine the equilibrium
composition and functions of state of the combustion and explosion products.
Inasmuch as the enthalpy or intrinsic energies of the products are given as the
dependencies of these variables on temperature and the expressions for the equili-
brium constants include pressure. the main parameters of state considered in such
calculations are tesperature and pressure. Knowing the equilibrium composition
and functions of state of combustion products at given P and 1', we can solve a
large number of technical problems. The main ones are: l) calculating the couposi-

tion, heat, telperature and other thermodynamic characteristics of coubustion pro-

ducts in adiabatic conditions at P-const. (la) and at V-const. (lb); 2) calcu-
lating expansion of combustion and explosion products (change in composition of
the products and in the functions of. state during expansion, calculating the rate
of flux and the work of expansion); 3) calculating the cooling of codmstion

products at V-const.: 4) calculating the thermodynamics of processes in shock waves.

The first or the above problems entails thermodynamic description of conbmtion
(or more precisely, its end results) in isobaric and isochoric processes. The
second provides intonation on isentropic expansion of gaseous products formed in
the course of an isobaric, isochoric or some other calmstion process.‘ The third
problem is associated with isochoric cooling of combustion and explosion products.

These idealised situations are very close to real situations in a mnber of cases.
'Note that all of these processes are adiabatic.

combustion proceeds at practically constant pressure in air, in the combustion

chamber of a jet engine operating under steady-state conditions and in apparatus
used to measure the rate of cowustion of explosives and powders, aptly named a
"constant pressure bulb." An isochoric process occurs when powder is burned in a
manoaetric bod: and, as a certain approximation, in the barrel of an artillery
weapon. The end products or a gas‘s coubustion in a constant volme bonb* and»
once again as a certain approximation, in the cylinder of an internal coutustion

are consistent with those obtained as a result of an isochoric process.

rocket engine, of processes following detonation of an explosive charge in air, and
of the discharge of powder combustion products out of a gun barrel. It stands

to reason that losses due to friction and heat exclunge may be ignored in far from
all of these cases, but adiabatic and isentropic processes are basically the most

significant.

When solving these problems we should turn special attention to the range of
pressures and temperatures within which the given process is examined. ht pressures
up to thousands of. atmospheres and temperatures above 1,000' the behavior of com-
bustion products may be described with good.accuracy (not less than [symbol illegi-
blel) using the equations of state of an ideal gas. When powder burns in a fire
weapon and in conventional artillery, pressure attains LOGO-5,000 atm. At such

pressures we should use the equation of state containing virial coefficients. When

'Cmbustion o: a gas in a bomb of constant voluse proceeds at constant teaperature

for the most part. It is only after all of the gas burns and the reaction products
in the bomb mix together that tamerature and pressure in keeping with an iso-

choric combustion process (the Mache effect) are established.

condensed explosives are detonated, a pressure on the order of tens and hundreds
of thousands of atmospheres is generated. In this case we would have to use the
ni-Gryunayzen equation (3.30). However, as the cubustion or detonation

products expand. the pressure within them drops, and beginning with a value
on the order of 1,000 atm the equation for an ideal gas once again becomes appli-
cable. Thus the simlest method of thermodynamic description of combustion and

explosion products enjoys a very broad area of application.

Precise thermodynamic calculation of combustion and expansion processes is ex-
tremely cuterscne, and it requires high-speed computers. A detailed description
of such calculations in application to combustion of powder in a rocket chamber
is given in (13) , and it is described in application to liquid-fueled rocket

engines in the handbook (4).

It should be noted, however, that in many cases the accuracy of such calculation
is intentionally excessive. On one hand the 6163319193 of formation of the initial
substances--fuels, oxidants, explosives and the ingredients of explosives and
solid rocket propellents, which are industrial-grade products usually of complex
composition with a low degree of purity, are only extremely moderate in their
reliability. at the other hand while the error of calculating a combustion process
with a computer is within hundredths of a percent, the deviation of a combustion
process from the calculated values (resulting from absence of equilibrium, devi-
ations from ideal conditions, losses not considered by the calculations) is
several percent as a rule, and frequently it is 10 percent and more, for example
in the case of calculations for detonation of explosive charges. For this reason
engineers still make broad use of simplified variants of thermodynamic calculation
that may be performed manually or with small computers, and they will be used for
a long period to come. One such method will be analysed below.

The calculations are made with the assuption of an adiabatic system, existence of
thermodynamic equilibriu and applicability of the equation of state for an ideal

gas.

To perform the calculations, we need to know:

1) The elemental cosposition of the initial system

2) the enthalpy of fornation of the initial substames and the expected transforma-
tion products;

3) the equilibrium constants for the hypothesized reactions;

4) dependence of enthalpy, intrinsic energy or the specific heat of products on

teaperature ;

5) pressure .

Systems containing the following elements are subjected to analysis: C, s, o, N,

We find the “emirical fornula'-the elemental composition of l kilogram of fuel or

sunning the products of the number of moles and their atomic weight, we verify the
calculations. The accuracy of our calculations is generally within several tenths

of a percent. The total weight must not deviate from 1 kg by more than 1 9n.

we determine the “enthalpy of formation'I of the initial system (once again in

For substances containing oxygen we calculate the oxygen balance (1.8) or the coeffi-

cient of excess oxidant (1.9).

reactions No 4-6 are shifted fully to the right--that is, that NO, N33, can. and

Q; is more realistic. It is the quantity of heat released upon cooling of coubustion
products in a calorimetric bomb (that is, at constant volune). Besides heat 0y,

it includes the heat of condensation of water vapor at 298°K (44.0 kj/mole). The
heats of condensation and dissolution of 8C1 and er and the heats of fusion of

A130 , Mgo and other substances, the phase constants of which differ at combustion

temperature and normal temperature, should be treated in similar fashion.

In the case of GINO systems, which form neither free carbon nor free oxygen when
burned (ao<l, name), 01 exhibits a unique feature: In View of the practical thermal
neutrality of the water gas reaction, as calculated in terms of liquid water, it
does not depend on the extent to which the equilibrium is shifted upon cooling.

And in fact, when the temperature decreases the equilibrium of reaction 1 in

Table 6 shifts leftward, in the direction of 002 formation. 'lhe rate of this reac-
tion decreases simultaneously as well, such that at a certain temperature that is
not too low (about l,500°l<) the typical cooling time becomes much shorter than the
time of the reaction, and the equilibrim "freezes." Depending on the cooling con-
ditions (the volume of the bomb, the pressure within it) the temperature and conse-
quently the "frozen composition" of the combustion products of a certain combustible
substance may be different. However, in View of the thermal neutrality of the
reaction C02+H2300+H20nqu1w the resulting effect (the value of Oz) would remain
the same. Other reactions, for example 2, 4 and 7 in 'J.‘able 6, do not exhibit this

capability: Their final thermal effects depend on the depth of transformation at

which the reaction stops. This situation is capitalized upon in the so-called

(De Pou) method of determining the heat of explosion. Most smokeless powders do
not form carbon (soot) and oxygen when burned. And yet many powder comments may
produce soot (or 02) when burned in the absence of air. If we measure the contri-
bution of these substances to the heat of cosbustion of powder directly, the ob-
tained heat would depend strongly on the testing conditions, and moreover it would
differ significantly from the heat released upon combustion of the given substance
in a powder mixture. In order to avoid this uncertainty we burn the substance
under analysis in a mixture with a high-calorie powder, the heat of combustion of
which is well known. and at a ratio of ingredients that would satisfy the condition

for the water gas reaction, it does not depend on the cooling conditions, and the
thermal effect characterizes the contribution made by the given ingredient to the
heat of explosion of any powder having a composition that satisfies the condition
given above. This contribution may be easily calculated a priori. Let substance 13

was noted earlier, acquisition of these values by calculation in the zero approxima-
tion would be sufficient in a nuber of cases of evaluating the performance of ex-
plosive or powder. The dependability of this approach is verified by calculating
the concentration of the dissociation and reaction products (3-7). At temeratures
below 2,000‘K and high pressure formation of nethsns, unaniua and (in the presence
of excess carbon) carbon dioxide is met probable, while at high teQerature NO.

If the concentration of the products of dissociation and of additional reactions is
not large (less than 0.05 holes/kg for examle), the zero approximation may be

thought of as sufficient: The error of all of the principal calculated parameters
would be less than 1 percent. If the concentrations of the secondary products are

sizcable, the calculations should be continued further.

After we determine n11”) we set up the balance equations for the different ele-
ments and calculate the new values of the 7: initial elements ("ﬂ”). Using these
values we repeat the calculation of the composition of the principal cosbustion
products similarly as we have done in the zero approximation, after which we once

again calculate the enthalpy of the reaction did the adiabatic tenperature. We

repeat the calculations until such time that the teqaerature remains constant

within iO-ZO'K.

Another way of calculating Tp (or T7) is to select, on the basis of the zero approx-

imation, two tenperature values close to the anticipated true value, and calculate

the couposition first at one value and then at the other, after which the true
teuperature and other characteristics of the reaction can be determined by linear

interpolation (or extrapolation for a slight distance, in) to 100‘K).

In this case if the error of determining the heat and temerature of coubustion can
be within 1 percent, we can use approximate relationships for the enthalpy of the

products, as given in Table 1. If greater accuracy is required we would need to

use the AMT) given in (3).

ary explosives; the figures were obtained by conputer calculation at a pressure of

tions. of the obtained products, the table contains only those for which the

For 18-19 of the explosives, the approxinate and precise calculations of all indi-

It should be noted that most practically eqloyed powders not containing high-

6.4. The nanic Characteristics of the Products of a Hi Pressure losion

At pressures from thousands to several tens of thousands of atmospheres we perform
the thernodynanic calculations with an equation of state containing virial coeffi-
cients. 'lhe results arrived at by the calculations described in section 6.2 are

a zero approximation in this case. 131s equilibrium constants of the principal re-
actions (1) or (2) are found at the tesperature of the zero approxiuation (T; or T3)
using the data in Table 6, and the coefficients of activity rd of the reagents are
found using formula (4.6) . 'men we use formula (4.7) to find coefficient Ka and a
new equilibrium constant for the volume within which coebustion proceeds. Using the
new equilibrium constants we calculate the cosposition and principal thermodynamic
characteristics of the conbustion products. When the result differs significantly
from the results obtained using the formulas in section 6.2, we repeat the calcula-
tions in relation to the new temperature values. An exaeple of the calculations can

be found in textbook (1).

At higher pressure we would have to use the Mi-m'yunayzen or the Becker-Kistyakovskiy-
Wilson (an) equation. Bquilibriuu constants [(0 calculated by Zubarev and Telegrin
(14) using an equation of the fore (3.30) for reactions (1) and (2) are given in
Table 12. Consistently with change in the equilibrium constants, as pressure rises
the concentrations of 002 and 820 grow while the concentrations of 00 and Hz drop.

In this case the concentration of hydrogen decreases faster than that of CO. And in

fact, we get the following for reactions (1) and (2) with respect to the constant

values given in Table 12;

Hence it follows that the concentration of co is (K'ZC-noo‘) 1/2 tines smaller than

If nc-o (for conventional explosives this is observed only at large values of so,
close to unity). the relationship between 7100, 7:002, "820 andnnz is governed by the

equation for the water gas reaction. Formula (6.2) is used in the calculations.

Finally at ao>l the composition of the detonation products is written in the same

way as for the zero approximation at moderate pressure:

“‘43.“... aVa,n.‘-u;/1- au.,.u.L,-2.; (a. l.i)
1f metals are present in the systole-Al, Hg, B and others, it is presmed that they
burn up in the detonation products to produce the appropriate oxides (3.1203, ago,
8303 ctc.). As is the case with moderate pressure, we begin the calculations with
transformation of the metal into its oxide. mining oxygen is consuaed in oxida-
tion of carbon and hydrogen. At high detonation pressure formation of metal nitrides

is possible. We will not examine these motions here.

In the presence of chlorine and fluorine Hcl and HP for- in the products of hydrogen-
containing explosives. Formation of a certain quantity of cm. has also been demon-

strated to be possible. we will not consider this substance in our calculations.

Table 13 shows the results of calculating the mitim of the detonation products
of some explosives at different initial charge densities. we can see that as density
decreases (and consequently as the detonation pressure decreases) the concentration
of co and H2 in the explosion products increases while the concentration of C01,

820 and CK decreases. At very low but practically fully attainable initial charge
density the conposition of the detonation products is consistent with that calculated

on the assumption that the equation of state for an ideal gas is applicable.

One interesting feature of the state of the products of detonation occurring at
ultrahigh pressure is that the following relationship is satisfied within a rather

broad interval of pressures:

p s av"; where". z”: i,‘~ “an”

is a polytropic equation. When the charge density and pressure decrease, n decreases.
From the standpoint of the theory of free volume this means that forces of reépulsion
play the principal role in equations such as (3.50) for detonation products. The
role of the thernal ccuponent and the forces of attraction, which depend weakly on
value. is snaller. the lennard-Jones potential (6-9) probably provides the most
accurate description of the true state of combustion products (this is indicated

by calculations made by Zubarev and lllelegin (14)). In this case the relationship

we get for pressure is p- (a/V“)-(b/V2)+ T; at small , the second and third terms

of this relationship somewhat weaken the dependence of PHI) on the first.

6_.5. mansion of the Detonation Products of Condensed Substances

In the first approximation. detonation products undergo polytropic expansion (6.18).
In this case the pressure drops very abruptly: At 71-3 it is proportional to the
ninth power of distance. As pressure decreases the polytropic index decreases and

the rate of pressure decline slows down. At coordinates lg V-lgPthe curve PW) may
be approximated by two straight lines. 1n. slope of the first in the high pressure

range is n, and the slope of the second is 2'. change in slope occurs at pressures

on the order of l,000-2,000 atmospheres.

The effective polytropic index (usually knead) is used to calculate the work of

expansion of explosive charges in a casing.

In view of the consequent intense changeinthe constants for reactions (1) and (2)
(Table 6), it is extremely difficult to calculate the cosposition of combustion
products as it changes in the course of expansion. In this connection attempts have
been made since long ago to experimentally determine the heat and composition of
explosive detonation products. The first apparatus intended for this purpose was
the Bikhel' bonb--a sealed vessel with walls 10-20 as thick and a capacity of 20-50
liters. The internal cavity of the bomb is sealed with a lead lining. and it is
covered by a nassive lid with 10-12 huge nuts tightened down by a l.S-neter wrench.
A charge weighing 50-200 gm was suspended in the center of the boat and exploded by
means of an electric detonator. Prior to the experiment air was evacuated from the
boob by a vacuum pump to a residual pressure of several dozen um 39. Bore-coupact
and convenient devices appeared later on, but their principle of operation essentially
remained the same. The results of experiments with a freely suspended charge are

shown in Table 14.

It should be pointed out immediately that these results may produce the completely
wrong impression as to the composition of explosion products at high pressure--at
tens and hundreds of thousands of atmospheres. When detonation products expand,
especially without expenditure of energy, the pressure within them drops very
strongly. while the temerature remains practically constant (in principle, it

may even grow). An equilibriun in keeping with a relatively low pressure establishes
itself within the space of the bow. In this case the composition of the explosion

products is calculated with the equation of state for an ideal gas, as described in
section 6.2. Examples of such calculations, shown in Table 14, demonstrate that they

are fully in agreement with experimentally obtained values.

In order to hinder secondary reactions at low pressure the explosive charge is
placed in a massive casing made from a soft metal (lead or copper). When the ex-
plosion occurs the casing disintegrates, and minute fragments fly apart in all
directions at high velocity. Energy is expended upon disintegration of the casing
and propulsion of its fragments, the explosion products cool quickly, and secondary
reactions are slowed down. In order to prevent interaction of explosim products
with [one line illegible] at the University of California (USA), the casing was
made from gold. The results of experiments with trotyl in a gold casing are given
in Table 15, together with old German data. ‘Ihese results differ from those obtained
with freely suspended charges: The explosion products of benzotrifuroxane include
a large concentration of 002, while the explosion products of trotyl contain much
00; and H20. In the case of octogen-r. substance richer in oxygen--the difference
in the results shown in tables 14 and 15 is smaller. But these researchers were
unable to completely inhibit the reactions proceeding during expansion or establish

the composition of products formed in the detonation wave. This problem has still

not been solved. The one thing that we have been able to do is to comare th'é‘
composition of expanding explosion products determined experimentally with calcula-
tions performed according to several of the available methods. These calculation
results are also given in Table 15. It follows fron then that following an explosion
in a massive casing, the equilibrium probably freezes at a temperature of 1,500-
l,800°K, approximately the sane as with a conventional colorimetric boob, though of
course at much higher pressure (0.5-5 GPa). Concurrently the consistency of the
calculated and experimental results also demonstrates how reliable the theoretical

models are.

It may be concluded in general that the thermodynamic methods of calculating
damnation processes in condensed explosives are for the moment much less developed
than the methods of calculating processes occuring during conbustion of fuels. The
main difficulty is associated with the absence of a reliable and universal equation
of state for mixtures of gaseous and condensed substances experiencing a teaperature
of several thousand degrees and a pressure of hundreds of thousands of atmospheres.
However, this area of science is developing quickly, and we can anticipate arisal

of new interesting and inportent results in the next few years.
