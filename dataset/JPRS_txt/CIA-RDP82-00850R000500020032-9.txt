[Article by USSR Academy of Sciences corresponding member A. Nothin: "Intensification
and Effectiveness of Expanded Reproduction"l

[Text] Socialist expanded reproduction is the continuous renewal and development of
productive forces and production relations of socialism. The organic bond among

these processes was underlined in the materials of the 26th CPSU Congress: "The
primary task of the 11th Five-Year Plan consists in ensuring continued growth in the
well-being of the Soviet people on the basis of steady. forward development of the
national economy. accelerating scientific-technical progress and changing the economy
over to an intensive path of development. nore efficient use of the country's produc-
tion potential. saving all types of resources in every way possible and improving work
quality.

Social reproduction is described in political economy from various aspects. If the
reference is to its major divisions, we distinguish simple and expanded reproduction.
its extensive and intensive types. In all instances. production forces are repro-
duced in a definite socioeconomic form which actively influences their level. rates
of growth and proportions. In other words, all types and forms of reproduction con-
ceal historically determined productive forces. This applies as well totheirstages
of development. both extensive and intensive.

At present. the most widespread form is reproduction intensification. in which economy
in some factors is ensured by additional expenditures of others. Thus. a manpower
savings is achieved on a base of growth in the availability of capital to labor.

which generally requires an increase in fixed assets and expenditures of energy and
auxiliary materials (especially when manual labor is replaced by mechanized labor).
The better use of available fixed production assets necessitates additional produc-
tion of objects of labor. even if proportionate expenditures on then decrease. Marx
also characterized the intensive type of expanded reproduction in that an increase in
the working time of fixed capital becomes possible only thanks to additional invest-
ments in supplemental circulating capital. Better use of basic means of production

in farming. meaning land. as expressed in increased crop yields. is connected under
present conditions with growth in mineral fertilizers production. development of ir-
rigation systems and introducing a number of tools of labor. As a result of the in-
teraction of a complex of production intensification factors. an overall reduction in
socially necessary resources expenditures is achieved. A primarily intensive path of
expanded reproduction signifies a predominance of economy in some resources over addi-
tional expenditures of and quantitative growth in others.

Given primarily an intensive type of expanded reproduction. it is primarily live 1a-
bor that is saved. At the same time. in the course of developing machine production.
the tendency towards saving means of production is intensified. However. given a
predominance of mechanization of manual labor. the savings in means of production
and the lowering of their cost only limit additional expenditures of means of pro-
duction needed to save live labor.

The experience of 20th century economic development has revealed opportunities for
changing over from a primarily intensive type of expanded reproduction to a more com-
prehensively intensive type on a national economic scale. In the industrial coun-
tries, machine production has already become the primary factor in productive forces
development. Although the process of replacing manual with mechanized labor has con-
tinued in the 20th century. technical progress has increasingly been accompanied. not
only in individual branches, but in all material production. by the continued develop-
ment of machines and the transition to machine systems. by an increase in the power

of each unit of equipment and of machine production as a whole.

In late 1980. the USSR had more than 170,000 mechanized and automated flow lines,
about 70,000 units of equipment with preset control. and the number of comprehen-
sively mechanized and automated sectors. shops and production facilities had reached
90 .000, while the number of comprehensively mechanized and automated enterprises had
grown from 1. 906 in 1965 to 5. 383 in 1975 and 6. 389 in 1939. At the same time. obso-
lete machinery, apparatus. devices and items were being withdrawn from production
(365 in USSR industry in 1965, 804 in 1970. 1.706 in 1975 and 7.255 in 1976-1979, or
an average of 1,816 per year). As th: comprehensiveness of production mechanization
and automation have increased. the proportion of the active portion of means of 1a-
bor. that which directly influences output growth. in fixed production assets has
risen.

An increase in equipment unit capacity is being observed in many branches of our coun-
try's national economy. Thus. the maximum unit capacity of the steam turbines which
have been put into operation was 300,000 k” in the Seventh Five-Year Plan and 800.000
k" in the Eighth. Ninth and first four years of the 10th; hydraulic turbines were
62,000 k" in the prewar five-year plans, 225.000 k" in the Seventh. 500.000 k" in

the Eighth and Ninth. and 660.000 k" in the first four years of the 10th. At USSR
thermal electric power plants. the power of installations with steam pressures of 130
atm or higher has increased from 21.6 million kilowatts in 1965 to 50.1 million kilo-
watts in 1970 and 132.1 million kilowatts in 1979. and their proportion of the total
power of thermal electric power plants increased from 23 to 37 to 78 percent during
that same period. The hourly productivity of rotary cement furnaces increased from
7.8 tons in 1940 to 21.6 tons in 1965. 30.4 tons in 1975 and 32.3 tons in 1979; the
figures for cement mills are 10 tons. 22.9 tons. 28.9 tons and 30.7 tons. respec-
tively. The maximum unit capacity of initial petroleum processing installations in
operation has increased from one million tons per year in the prewar five-year plans
to six million tons per year in the Eighth and Ninth and eight million in the 10th.

‘Harx himself noticed this tendency. writing that "the mass and value of the machines
t-cing used grow with the development of labor' a productive force. but not propor-
tional to growth in the productive force itself. that is. not proportional to the
increase in the amount of product being delivered by these machines" (K. Marx and
F. Engels. "Soch." [Works]. Vol 25. Part 1. p 121). Chapter 5 of the first part of
volume 3 of "Des Kapital" is devoted especially to economy in the use of constant
capital.

Structural shifts have occurred which favor a less capital—intensive processing in-
dustry as a whole (especially branches producing end products. and machinebuilding
first of all). From 1970 through 1979. gross output in all USSR industry increased
1.72-fold, including a 1.75-fold increase in processing industry and a 1.36-fold in-
crease in extractive industry. The ratio of the production accumulation norm to the
recompensation norm has changed in favor of the letter, permitting the accelerated
replacement of less-productive with more-productive equipment, saving on major over-
hauls and new construction. and expanding production with fewer expenditures of re-
sources. Hodern construction methods have permitted a sharp reduction in construc-
tion time and. given .mprovement in planning and material supply, in the proportion
of unfinished construction. Thanks to the savings in fixed and circulating produc-
tion capital. the accumulation factor has been lowered. (It is taken to mean the

norm of production accumulation needed to obtain a one-percent increment in physical
exchange of national income.‘)

Experienced personnel and socialist competition enable us to reduce the time involved
in mastering designed capacities and planned economic indicators at new and renovated
enterprises; at production capacities with "analogs" in the country. it can be lowered
to the time needed for start-up and adjustment work. The scientific-technical revo-
lution has posed the question of increasing the speed of production processes and re-
ducing production time and work periods in a number of branches of industry. Reduc-
ing production time is becoming an important way of intensifying social production.

In solving the problem of providing new enterprises with manpower, the role of its
redistribution in the national economy increases. In a number of socialist countries.
in the first stage of socialist industrialization the redistribution of manpower from
agriculture to nonagricultural branches (including new and renovated industrial en-
terprises) became a factor in the swift rise in their rates of economic growth.- At
present, when a large labor potential is available in all branches of production. the
reference is to using manpower better. Given the former or a lower number of people
employed at existing production enterprises. substantial production expansion can be
achieved only with high rates of increase in labor productivity. At the same time.

these rates have been inadequate in recent years in the USSR national economy (see
table. following page).

The data presented testify that a substantial rise in the rates of labor productivity
growth is the primary task in the area of intensifying social production in the USSR
(especially in connection with the lower rates of increment in able-bodied population).

The importance of reducing the materials-intensiveness of production is also great.
Many factors influence the materials-intensivenesa dynamic. Reducing primary raw ma-
terial losses during extraction. lowering specific expenditures of fuel, raw and other

development of the national economy depend on the initial structural proportions of
the national economy. on the so-called structural potentials of each preceding per-
iod," has noted that: "Factor K . which describes the national income accumulation

sure a systematic reduction in expenditures of objects of labor. This is of top-

llth Five-Year Plan and to lcwer specific expenditures of rolled ferrous metals in
machinebuilding and metalworking by at least 18-20 percent, of steel pipe by 10-12
percent, and of rolled nonferrous metals by 9-11 percent.

As concerns the dynamics of return on capital. there have been periods in the history
of USSR economic development when the return on capital has been higher. This was
associated in considerable measure with rebuilding processes (after the civil war and
World Bar II) which occurred on a base of available production capacities. The lat-
ter were either underutilized or were rebuilt and gradually brought up to capacity
while retaining some parts of the enterprises. Replacing obsolete and obsolescent
equipment with more productive equipment is currently of urgent importance in the
Soviet economy. At the same time. factors are operating which retard the changeover
to comprehensive intensification in all social production.

Large amounts of manual labor are still used in many branches. The comprehensive
intensification of individual production facilities and branches must therefore be
combined with manual labor mechanization (especially in auxiliary Jobs). The import-
ance of this problem was underlined in the CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council
of Ministers decree on perfecting the economic mechanisn (July 1979). which pointed
out the necessity of setting five-year plan assignments on reducing the use of man-
ual labor. Hechanizing manual labor facilitates both raising labor productivity and
eliminating the manpower shortage and improving working conditions. At the same
time. it is one factor causing growth in fixed production assets as compared not
only with the live labor being used. but also with output (to the same extent that
lowering the return on capital thanks to mechanizing auxiliary work is not compen-
sated for by growth in the equipment use factor in basic jobs which has been caused
by that mechanization). Involving the natural riches of Siberia and the Far East in
economic circulation, the necessity of developing highly capital-intensive transport
and the entire production and nonproduction infrastructure on a broad scale. large
investments in agricultural fixed assets on which the full return will not be en-
sured right away. large investments in environmental protection - all these pro-
cesses also retard growth in the return on capital. which is an essential factor in
comprehensive intensification of social production.

In 1980. USSR fixed production assets and materials circulating capital had increased
2.03-fold as compared with 1970 and national income produced had increased 1.62-fold.
Consequently. the return on capital in all material production as a whole had dropped
to 80 percent of the 1970 level. The average annual reduction was 2.2 percent per
year. At the same time, the USSR possesses an enormous production apparatus. and
even a comparatively small annual rise in its use factor (of 2 to 2.5 percent) could
'counteract the trend towards a reduction in the return on capital. Reducing the time
involved in mastering new capacities. reducing equipment idle time, improving labor
discipline and deliveries of materials and growth in the shift index in individual
branches (foremost in machinebuilding and metalworking, where the equipment operation
shift index is 1.35) can play a substantial role in this.

An economically substantiated price-setting policy for new equipment which conforms
to increased capacity could be of substantial significance in counteracting the re-
duction in return on capital in price terms. Quite a few examples could be given of
improvement in equipment use. In particular. the usable volume of blast furnaces
per ton of pig iron has decreased from 1.19 m’ in 1940 to 0.977 m3 in 1950, 0.761 m’
in 1960. 0.597 u’ in 1970 and 0.51.9 n’ in 1978 (1: rose to 0.566 n’ in 1979). and

blast furnace running down time decreased from 6.6 percent of the nominal tine avail-
able in [940 to 1.8 percent in 1950, 1.2 percent in 1960 and one percent in 1970 (it
increased to 1.6 percent in 1979). Average daily steel skim per square meter of

hearth in open-hearth furnaces increased from 0.26 to 9.77 tons during that same per-
iod (decreasing to 9.49 tons in l979). end down time in percentage of the calendar
time available decreased from 26.2 to 9.6 percent (increasing to 10.5 percent in 1979).
The use factor (in terms of calendar tine available) for rotary cement furnaces in-
creased from 0.51 in 1960 to 0.88 in 1975 and «as 0.86 in 1979.

The opinion is sometimes expressed that no savings in some production factors can be
achieved without additional expenditures on others. In our view. this opinion ig-
nores the features of modern technical progress. The rsplacenent of less-productive
machines with more-productive ones not only increases the return on fixed assets, but
labor productivity as well. and machines with higher unit capacities often require
less expenditures of metal per unit of power. The interaction of factors in the sys-
tem of comprehensive intensification is reflected in dissimilar rates of economy of
live labor. materials and existing means of labor. Different rates of comprehensive
intensification are possible. which has been proven in practice. Historical exper-
ience shows that a reduction in the labor-andmateriels-intsnaivsness of production
is achieved faster and that the return on capital then stabilizes and begins to rise.

So the intensive type of expanded reproduction arising and developing on a base of
technical progress. even given a predominance of the extensive type. then passes
through two stages: first, the stage of primarily intensive development. in which

expenditures of means of labor. but in both instances. necessarily with an overall
reduction in expenditures per unit of physical volume of social and net product; se-
cond. the stage of comprehensively intensive development. which is effected with a
savings of all types of resources (manpower. means and objects of labor. energy. and
also the country's natural riches) per unit of social product. In this regard. the
character of the interconnection of the dynamics of various factors is changed. In
the first stage of intensification. the manpower savings is achieved through addi-
tional expenditures of means of labor and energy; in the second stage, the savings
in means of labor and the reduction in materials-intensiveness serve as additional
means for saving labor resources as well. Saving means of production leads to a re-
duction not only in capital- and materials-intensiveness. but also in the labor-
intensivsness of material production. At the same time. the relationship between
gross and end product is radically altered in favor of the latter.

Comprehensive intensification has already been implemented in the first stage in
individual spheres and branches. but the transition to the second stage will occur

when the savings in all production resources becomes a continuously operating fac-
tor in the developnent of the national economy.

Development of a socialist national economy on a path of intensification and passage
through its different stages is a process whose results find expression in greater
expanded reproduction effectiveness. in ensuring possibly large end results while
minimizing expenditures of embodied and live labor and saving natural resources.

Finding a correct relationship of intensification and effectiveness is a most import-
ant question in the socialist economy. "Increasing production effectiveness in every
way possible is the fundamental basis of modern economic development. a most import—

ant economic-political task of the current stage of building communism," notes the
Materials of the 26th CPSU Congress.

Scientific development of various aspects of the problem of socioeconomic effective-
ness in the USSR already has a long history. In the socialist industrialization per-
iod. the most attention was paid to the effectiveness of capital investments in in-
dividual construction projects. As a result of theoretical research and discussions
in this area, methods were worked out for determining the economic effectiveness of
capital investments —- a general method for all branches and individual methods for
a number of branches. taking their specifics into account. Questions of capital in-
vestment effectiveness are also pressing in the period of transition to a primarily
intensive type of expanded reproduction. The reference is to concentrating capital
investments in the most important projects. to reducing the time needed to install
new projects and utilize them. to the comparative advantage of capital investments
in retooling. to fundamentally new equipment. as well as to equipment which saves
both live labor and means of production.

A general theory of the socioeconomic effectiveness of socialist production as a
whole was worked out in the 1970's. Enriched by the achievements of the political
economy of socialism. this theory has played a large role in develong modern eco~
nomic science and planning in the nations of socialism.

The approach of defining the intensive type of expanded reproduction as a system of
interconnected factors predetermines a similar approach to measuring intensification
effectiveness. The complexity of measuring a primarily intensive type of expanded
reproduction results from the fact that purely extensive development is retained in
individual sectors of the national economy: installing some enterprises at approxi-
mately the previous technical-economic level, enlisting additional manpower with

the usual skills. developing new deposits. using new land and forests. new fisher-
ies. We therefore need to determine the relationships of all intensive and exten-
sive factors of expanded reproduction is. order to solve the problem of intensifica-
tion effectiveness.

The process of production intensification as a savings in some factors and addi-

tional expenditures of others finds adequate expression through the economic cate-

gory of social labor productivity. described by the formula ¥. in which dynamic NP
(net product of society, expressed in comparable prices) also includes the savings
in or additional material expenditures and l. is the increment in those employed in

material production or the increase in time worked. expressed in units of simple ls-
bor per year. However, 3;: expresses only the current savings in live and embodied

labor, but not the savings in or additional expenditure of production assets being

one trillion rubles, but the value of fixed assets in commodity-material values re-
serves was almost 300 billion rubles. Their use plays an enormous role in develop-
ing the national economy. The most con-on indicator of production assets use is the
return on fixed and circulating capital in the form of net product of society.

Labor productivity dynamics and return on capital are closely interrelated. Given
previous capital amounts. increasing labor productivity increases return on capital.
In turn. growth in return on capital leads to higher labor productivity. However.
there are substantial differences between the dynamics of these two parameters.
Hhereas growth in return on capital generally leads to higher social labor produc-
tivity. growth in social labor productivity is naturally accompanied by a lower re-
turn on capital at certain stages (as, for example. in the large-scale replacement

of manual labor by aechanized labor and a rise in the proportion of capital-intensive
branches). At the same time. when return on capital is decreased. additional produc-
tion accumulations are required to maintain the labor productivity growth rates and
national income achieved. which limits consumption growth rates.

In the Seventh. Eighth. Ninth and 10th five-year plans. the relationship of the dy-
namics of social labor productivity and return on capital were as follows:

social labor return on capital in
productivity social production

1961-1965 +5.6 -2.4
1966-1970 +6.8 -0.3
1971-1975 +6.6 -l.9
1976-1980 +3.2 -2.6

The figures given testify that return on capital nearly stablized in 1966-1970, when
the highest rate of social labor productivity increment was achieved. Stabilization
of the return on capital was one factor in attaining high rates of social labor pro-
ductivity growth. Therefore. it is always necessary. when planning the effective-
ness of intensifying social production. to compare the dynamics of social labor pro-
ductivity and the return on capital and to determine an effective measure of growth
in the latter at which the impact of increasing labor productivity would exceed the
additional expenditures associated with growth in the capital-intensiveness of pro-
duction (taking into account the fact that each percentage point of these additional
expenditures. in absolute terms, currently exceeds a one-percent increment in labor
productivity by more than 2.5-fold).

A comparison of social labor productivity growth with the dynamics of return on capi-
tal enables us to judge not only change in the degree of intensification, but also,
indirectly. the achieved level of effectiveness of it. This comparison expresses.
first of all. the technical and organic composition of the production and. second.
the actualisation of this composition in social labor productivity. Thus. USER
gross social product grew 1.6-fold from 1970 through 1979. in comparable prices,
and national income grew 1.57-fold, with a 1.42-fold increase in social labor pro-
ductivity. a 1.92-fold increase in fixed and circulating production assets and a
1.14-fold increase in employment in mater-al production. These data show that the
rapidly growing organic composition of production is still being inadequately "com-
pensated for" by the level of social labor productivity achieved in the USSR.

The requirement of overcoming the gap between these values necessitates completing
the transition to a primarily intensive type of expanded reproduction and developing
a more comprehensively intensive type. To these ends, the llth Five-Year Plan anti-
cipates 18-20 percent growth in national income and 17-20 percent growth in social
labor productivity, with'an absolute and relative increment in capital investment
less than in the 10th Five-Year Plan (by 12-15 percent). "In terms of its histori-
cal scale. importance and consequence." the 26th CPSU Congress noted. "the current
tran :er of our economy onto tracks of intensive development can rightfully be con-
sidered the equal of such very profound transformations as socialist industrializa-
tion, which fundamentally altered the face of the country."

Social production is the basic phase of reproduction. but it does not encompass the
entire problem of socioeconomic effectiveness. The impact of intensifying expanded
reproduction is not simply national income produced, but also national income used
for consumption and accumulation. The end results of production. distribution, cir-
culation and consumption are expressed in national income used; the foreign trade
balance and a portion of the losses of product and income in the expanded reproduc-
tion process are also taken into account. The following data‘ show the quantitative
differences in the absolute amounts of USSR income produced and used (in prices ac-
tually in effect) and their structure:

*With consideration of expenditures on housing and sociocultural construction related
to the general accumulation fund. the consumption fund is approximately four-fifths
of all used national income.

Use of national income used (NR1) as the final impact of expanded reproduction re-
quires that it be supplemented by control indicators of consumption and accumulation
resources used. Consumption resources (designated K). as a primary part of used na-
tional income, are defined as the increase in the amount of material vealth consumed
by workers in material production. expenditures on education. public health and meet—
ing the cultural and persoanl-services needs of the workers. as well as expenses to
cover wear in housing. the school network. hospitals. cultural and other institutions
serving the population.

Consumption resources (K) are a control indicator of the ispact of the entire ex-
panded reproduction process. A comparison of the two impact indicators (NR1 and K)
describes the orientation of all socialist expanded reproduction towards increasing
the well-being of the people (in spite of the absolute reductions in agricultural

output which have occurred for a number of years. the proportion of consumption
resources in USSR used national income has risen from 73.6 percent in 1965 to 75.1
percent in 1979. thanks in particular to the use of foreign trade for these pur-
poses). At the same time, the impact of each reproduction cycle must consist not
only of elements being consumed in a given period, but also of conditions of con-
tinued production and consumption growth.

Before becoming part of expenditures in the next production cycle, the production
accumulation fund is part of the impact of the preceding production cycle. All used
national income, on whose amount both meeting the current needs of the people and
the possibility of expanded reproduction of the socialist economy in the interests
of growth in the well-being of the people depend, therefore becomes an effect of the
intensification of expanded reproduction under socialism. The possibility of maxi-
mizing the consumption fund unavoidably assumes the achievement of an optimm among
production, consumption and accumulation. Comprehensive economy of accumulation re-
sources for the purpose of increasing the well-being of the people is one of the
most important intensification tasks of the 1980's.

Determining intensification effectiveness is associated with consideration of dif-
ferences between produced and used national income, but also of differences between
outlays on simple and expanded reproduction. A Marxist division of social reproduc-
tion into simple and expanded is a division from a viewpoint of end results, of to-
tal volume. That does not mean that all proportions remain as before under simple
reproduction. Simple reproduction can be characterised by major shifts in techno-
logy. the economy and social relations. by a reduction or increase in the size of
the fund for recompensing means of production as compared with the achieved level of
production material expenditures. The following questions arise when determining
the fund for reconpensing means of production: in what amount nust this fund be ta-
ken into account -- entire gross value circulation or that minus the value of objects
of labor to eliminate the "recalculation" which occurs in the course of the year;
what are the interconnections between the recompeneation and accumulation funds.

The reconpensation fund is the m of all actual expenditures of means of production
needed to obtain the year's national income. Its achievement also requires inter-
mediate expenditures. and the task is to obtain the end product with the least pos-
sible such expenditures. When planning the proportionality of economic development.
we need to examine the entire annual value circulation, as it is precisely here that
the actual proportions among the spheres. branches and different aspects of produc-
tion and reproduction arise. As concerns the question of the interconnection be-
tween the recompensation and accumulation funds, it arises first of all because the
replacement of manpower by machinery also occurs within the sinple reproduction
framework, requiring a certain total accumulation. other conditions being equal.
This accumulation requires that simple reproduction be viewed not in isolation. but
as an integral part of expanded reproduction. It in no way follows from this fact
that expanded reproduction always assumes sccmulation (and production accuwlation
first of all) that accumulation is required only in expanded reproduction.

A number of economists and statisticians take the view that the accumulation fund is
part of national income which is measured through the increment in fixed and meter-
ial circulating capital and reserves. while the accumulation norm is the share of
that increment in national incoae in a given year. At the same time. capital in-
vestments from national income in a given year predetermine the growth in fixed

10

assets within that period of time only partially. A large portion of them go to
unf- in ishod construction and. in part. to increasing fixed assets in the given year.

The accumulation of circulating production capital is ordinarily defined as the in-
crement in material circulating capital and reserves. It includes the increment in
production stocks and unfinished production of finished products. co-Iodities in
the circulation sphere and agricultural output of the population. "hen the refer-
ence is to all phases of reproduction, then sunning up all these material circulat-
ing assets is justified. However. when determining production accumlation, it is
necessary to take into account only the substantive conditions of continuous up-
dating and continuing growth in production. Stores of a large portion of the fin-
ished products in social production and agricultural produce mong the population
must be taken into account in the used national income in consumption resources.

In so doing. the total value of expanded reproduction outlays will comprise actual
recompensation of production funds plus the wage fund for production workers plus
the accumulation fund for means of production. These outlays include expenditures
on prciucing. distributing and circulating the entire social product. New substan-
tive products are not created in the distribution and circulation phases. but the
cost of services in storing. transporting. packing and packaging products, and so
forth, is added. Losses comprise a certain portion of these outlays.

Inasmuch as the increment in fixed assets in a given year "feeds" on capital invest-
ments of previous years. adding a portion of the capital investments of the given
year. it can be viewed as the equivalent of these investments and "enter" the out-
lays of expanded reproduction in the given year. together with total capital in-
vestments made to obtain the impact over a number of years. This removes the time-
lag problem. It seems to us that the incrmaent in fixed assets in the year preced-
ing the year the national income is obtained is most suited to describing the accu-
nulation fund, inasmuch as this increment is used mainly to obtain additional impact
during that time cement.

Socialist accumulation serves the expanded reproduction of collectivized fixed and
circulating capital, public ownership of the means of production and the entire sys-
tem of socialist production relations. Whereas the accumulation fund is saved gi-
ven this particular type of intensification. additional resources are formed for
raising the level of well-being of the people and the socioeconomic effectiveness

of the entire expanded reproduction process is increases. which is of very import-
ant significance during the period of developed socialism.

Foreword

Technical progress in construction in recent years has been associated with an
improvement in planning and structural schemes for buildings and structures, an
improvement in and standardization of components in industrial and civil con-
struction, and typification of their products list and varieties of products

which has practically provided the growth in the industrialization of construction
and made it possible to move the processes of manufacturing components and parts
from the construction sites and substantially reduce labor consumption for
construction.

The further goals of improving the efficiency of construction production and
bringing about an uninterrupted growth in labor productivity are closely associated
with evaluating and implementing production potentials which are based on the
maximum utilization of intensive factors and reducing the duration of and labor
consumption for construction. Accelerating the rates of growth for labor produc-
tivity on the basis of mobilizing the existing potentials for reducing labor
consumption and the efficient use of work time is becoming an urgent necessity.

The further mechanization of construction processes on the basis of utilizing

the set of modern machines and rechanisms is an important factor in reducing
labor consumption for construction. The increase in the number of every type

of machine is accompanied by an increase in their power and the adoption of new
improved types. Powerful excavators with an increased bucket capacity, scrapers
with improved readability, bulldozers with special suspended equipment and large-
load dump trucks with improved roadability are appearing at construction sites.

Considering the huge volumes of construction and installation work that is done,
each percent improvement in the level of mechanization provides a substantial
reduction in labor expenditures. Calculations show that increasing the level of
mechanization in earth work by only 0.8 percent makes it possible to free several
men for each million rubles of construction and installation work.

The system of new machines that is arriving at construction sites in recent times
corresponds more fully to technological demands and the conditions for producing
work in various sectors of construction. The increase in the power and operating
speeds of construction machinery is being accompanied by a substantial improvement
in their power conserving indicators; they are equipped with means for programmed
and remote control.

General purpose hydraulic excavators, bulldozers and rippers on powerful caterpillar
tractors, wheeled tow cars, self-propelled scrapers with increased bucket capacities,
wheeled and caterpillar loaders, mobile pile driving units, tubular diesel hammers,
vibration drivers, equipment for laying out rammed piles, and machines for laying
utility lines without trenches are being extensively used in construction. The
fleet of tower cranes is increasing due to mobile pneumatic tire cranes on special
chassis. Hydraulic cranes with telescoping booms have become extensively used.

The structure of the ileet of tower cranes is changing due to an increase in the
number of cranes with booms up to 60 meters long and cranes with a load lifting
capacity of 10 to 25 tons. A further improvement in the structure of the fleet of
machines will promote a reduction in labor expenditures in construction.

A general improvement in the level of mechanization and automation for construction
processes and also an improvement in the use of machines over time should ensure
the freeing of workers who are engaged in construction.

The current Handbook on Construction Machinery and Equipment has as its goal pro-
viding necessary information about new models of construction machinery and equip-
ment,the serial output of which began in 1975 to 1978 and which is planned for sub—
sequent years. Individual models of construction machinery and equipment that have
the most long range importance and which are undergoing modernization and are being
serially produced at the present time are also described in the handbook.

The purpose and scope of use of construction machinery and equipment is stated in
the first section of thr handbook and it contains brief descriptions of their

arrangement and use; technical features, the peculiarities of the conditions for
operating the machines, potential troubles and methods of eliminating them are given.

' An index of construction machinery and equipment, and the technical features of the
base machines and tow trucks with which the self-propelled construction machines
are combined is given in the second section (appendix). The basic standards and
regulations for turning over machines and units for repair and accepting them back
are stated.

The technical features of the machines and equipment given will help to select the
most appropriate one of them and to use them more correctly and fully.

The Handbook on Construction Machinery and Equipment was compiled based on state
standards, all union normative documents, catalogues, manuals, formulas and instruc-
tions for utilizing the plants that manufacture construction machinery and equipment.

Drawings of only the leading, most characteristic models of machines that have the
most long range importance are given in the handbook. For the convenience of readers
the basic normative materials for utilizing machines are indicated in the handbook.
The handbook is intended for engineering and technical workers at construction sites,
ranges, loading and unloading bases, designers, students in military engineering
academies, schools and also equipment operators.
