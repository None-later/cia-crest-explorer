The work of the seninar transpired in plenary and section meetings in two sec-

tions: surface and internal waves. The participants in the meeting expressed an
interest in holding a scientific conference in 1980 and the publication of a
specialized collection of articles.

The collection of articles contains presentations of studies presented at the sen-
inar and devoted to theoretical and experimental investigations of surface and in-
ternal waves generated in the ocean by periodic, pulsed and moving disturbances.

The first section includes articles which examine surface and long waves arising
in a barotropic ocean. The diffraction of waves by spatial inhonogeneities of bot-
tom relief is studied; the influence of the velocity shear of sea currents on
three-dimensional waves generated by a moving pressure region is investigated; con-
putations of the distributions of orbital velocities of wind waves are given; the
role of the ice cover in the process of propagation of flexursl-gravitational
waves is analyzed. In the case of long waves a study is made of the generation of

Iturup Island. evolution of axisynmetric disturbances is studied, and the influ-
ence of viscosity and the [3-effect on waves generated by periodic disturbances

in a basin of variable depth is investigated.

The second section of this collection includes articles which examine internal
waves. Long-period spatial internal waves arising from nonaxisylmetric initial
disturbances in the absence of a flow are analyzed; nonstationary short-period plane
internal waves in the presence of a flow with a sharp change in velocity are stud-
ied; the distorting influence of fine stratification on free and forced waves is
investigated: an evaluation of the possible values of elements of internal waves

in the zone of the southern polar front is given; the variability of the energy
density of internal waves with depth is considered; the influence of viscosity

on wave processes in the stratified ocean is analyzed.

[Text] Abstract: The problem of the theory of
waves are considered when axisy-netric in-
honogeneities are present. Sons precise
solutions are found and the methods of gen-
eralized power series and approximation of
solutions by polynomials are set forth.

The diffraction of waves in the broad sense is the deviation of wave moveaents
from the laws of geometrical optics. This phenonenon is generated when the nadiun
contains some inhomogeneities localized or distributed in space.

As is well known, the application of rigorous nethods of mathematical physics to
solution of the problems of wave propagation, diffraction and scattering is lin-
ited and belongs to classical problems. Recently spproximte analytical and numer-
ical methods are being developed [1. lo, 6-9, 11-15].

1. Introduction. The classical problem of the theory of nonststionary diffraction
is fornulated in the following way [5]. Assume that some closed region R with

the boundary a R is stipulated in the region Q, oriented in a rectangular Cartes-
ian coordinate system at, y, z and a plane wave is propagated along the Ox-axis (Fig
1). Then the diffraction problem is reduced to the Cauchy problem or the boundary-
value problem for an equation in partial derivatives (or systen of equations) in
the Q region, whose coefficients experience discontinuities of the first kind on
the 01! surface. The a R surface is characterised by a curvilinear coordinate sys-
tem.

We will assume that the field in the external region Q is described by the wave
equation for the function If (x. y, z, t)

The (f fmction is represented in the form of the sun of the incident (’1 and the
scattered 9s fields (I- (,1 + 9", where 91(x,0,0,t) - F(x + ct).
He will new that at the tine t - 0 the leading edge of the wave touches the 3 R

surface. This is equivalent to the following: for the sought-for function 9 and
its derivative t the following initial conditions are stipulated

After the substitution of 9% 9’1 4- ‘f. into (l.1)-(l.3) we obtain a honogeneous

equation relative to 9,, since ([1 satisfies the wave equation, and inhomogeneous
boundary-value conditions, since 91 is a stipulated function.

Scattered and incident fields in diffraction problems are described in different
coordinate systens. Accordingly, one of the fields must be restructured into
another coordinate systen, which is not a sinple problem.

Depending on the properties of the I! region, which in diffraction theory is call-
ed an inhomogeneity, obstacle, scatterer or diffracting body, it is possible to

distinguish three cases: ideally reflecting or translucent body, the field does
not enter into the R region; transparent object whose properties are different

from the surrounding medium. but are constant, that is, in the [I region are not
dependent on space coordinates; an arbitrary inhomogeneity whose properties in
the R region are dependent on the space coordinates. In the two letter cases, in
addition to the external problem, it is also. necessary to solve the internal prob-
lem.

The first case includes: absolutely rigid body in an acoustic field, ideally con-
ducting in an electromagnetic field and a vertical cylinder (junction) protruding
above the free surface in the field of surface gravitational waves. As an example
for the second and third cases we can use an underwater projection with a constant
or variable depth (Fig. 2) in the field of surface gravitational waves.

The stationary diffraction problem is formulated on the basis of (1.1), (1.5) in
the form of a boundary-value problem for the Helmholtz equation

As before the solution is represented by the sum (7- $1 + V3. The boundary-value
conditions are similar for a R. In addition, in order to ensure uniqueness of the
solution we introduce the radiation condition and the condition of limitation at

infinity -- the So-erfeld conditions. They have the form in three- and two-dimen-
sional cases

2. Formulations of some problems. He will examine an axisylmastric inhomogeneity
whose center is matched with the origin of cylindrical (r, 0, a) and spherical (r,

0, $9) coordinate systems: f - f (r), Osrgro. Outside the inhomogeneity r >ro the
properties of the medium are constant.

A plane monochromatic wave travels from infinity: it partially bypasses the ob-
stacle, is partially reflected and partially passes through the inhomogeneity,
being refracted (Fig. 2).

Within the framework of a longdwave approximation, for a wave in water the problem
is formulated relative to the velocity potential 9° . In the region of variable
depth H - H(r) we obtain the differential equation [9]

3. Precise solutions. In all formulations the problems of diffraction of mono-
chronatic waves are reduced to solution of the Helmholtz equation with variable
coefficients. For inhomogeneities with cylindrical and spherical symetry it is

possible to use the method of separation of variables, which leads to an investi-
gation of an ordinary differential equation with variable coefficients. In some

special cases this equation allows the formlation of precise solutions.

5. Approximate solutions. In the case of arbitrary axisyunetric inhomogeneities
which are approximated by power-law polynomials or are stipulated at once in such
a form the problems are reduced to solution of an equation in the form

We will assume that this equation satisfies the Fuchs theorem [10] (y - y(x); an,

bn are known coefficients). According to the method of» generalized power series
(Probenius method) the solution is represented in the form of a convergent gener-
alized power series . _

where the V and 0! n values are determined from the recurrent relationships, which
follow from (4.1) after the substitution of (4.2). This method is conveniently

used in complex problems, but it is characterized by slow convergence of series
in the form (4.2). '

The method of approximation of solutions by algebraic polynomials is more effec-
tive. These are selected from the condition of a best approximation for the norm
in the space of piecewise-continuous functions C.

He note in conclusion that the characteristics of scattering of waves by inhomogene

note that for solution of problems of nonstationary wave defraction a method based

on the analytical derivation of a precise solution in the space of Laplacian time
images and with numerical transformation to the original is effective [7].

[Text] Abstract: An analysis of the amplitude
characteristics of a three-dimensional
wave trace caused by a region of atmo-
spheric pressure disturbances is given
within the framework of linear theory.
The current velocity gradient is assum-
ed to be constant with depth and the
fluid is assumed to be homogeneous.

In [1] the authors gave an asymptotic analysis of the pattern of development of
three-dimensional surface waves and ntnerical nethods were employed in studying
the dependence of limiting angles of the wave trace, phase portraits and velo-
cities of propagation of the leading edges of transverse and longitudinal waves on
current velocity shear. Current velocity was assured to be a linear function of
depth (11(2) - Ill + a(z + ID). The wave-forming effect of a ship'was replaced by a

region of norms stresses moving at a constant velocity. In this article we give
an investigation of the amplitude characteristics of wave movement.

The expression for deviation of the free surface of the fluid from an undisturbed
position in a coordinate systen related to a moving region of nor-a1 stresses
has the form [1)

visually discriminated sectors with an angle 30 in which the main wave disturbances
are actually concentrated. The asyuptotes give exaggerated values of the area of re-
gions in which the main wave disturbances are situated (Pig. 2,b for Au - 0 and 2,c
for Au - -2 n-sec'l); the positioning of the sector with the angle to relative to
the horizontal reads and the value of the 3'0 angle are virtually not dependent on
the current velocity shear (in all three cases 301418. 5'01: 9').

tion of lesser values of the horizontal coordinate x. The height of the two most

It was noted in [l], with transformation from a double integral (1.8) for Band r
to a single integral (1.9) for r with integration limits from r1 to + 00, that
(1.9) is correct in the region of V1 values in which the inverse function r( V )
is unambiguous. Here r1 is a root of the equation V- Vi. He will examine this n
greater detail.

A numerical analysis of the J1(r) function in the range of parameters of the prob-
lem for which computations were carried out in [1] indicated that for Au - 0 and

2 m-sec‘1 it decreases monotonically, with 11% R v (r) - 3:. Accordingly, the in-
verse function will be nonotonic and mambigmus. urves of the R v1(r) function in

The values of the variable r which is used in integration in the single integral
lust satisfy the condition Vﬂﬁ. Then in the case of a monotonic function R V1(r)
the integration interval assmes the form [13, +00]. For the function RV1(r) with
a local maximun there can be a variant in which the integration interval is broken

down into two parts In, r2] U [r3 +00], where r2. r3 are roots of the equation

Summary

a) It has been established that for all the current velocity shear values used in
the computations the sea surface profiles constructed on the basis of asymptotic
formulas and using a more precise integral expression for all practical purposes
differ little from one another within the region delinited by the horizontal x-axis,
the leading edges of the developing waves and the boundaries of the limiting angles.

In the neighborhood of the region boundaries there are significant differences in
the form of the profiles.

b) The main Have disturbances are conce.creted in the sector between the rays drawn
at the angles ot9 and n/27° to the araxis.

c) The arrival of the wave disturbances in a stationary regime occurs more rapidly
for negative values of the current velocity shear.

[Text] Abstract: A study was made of the influence
of current velocity shear on the amplitudes
of waves generated by surface pressure dis-
turbances moving uniformly and linearly. It
is demonstrated that the shear of the transverse
velocity component'exerts a considerable influ-
ence on the phase configuration of the wave
trace and increases the maximum surface rises
of the fluid. The influence of current velocity
shear is most conspicuous with saall velocit-
ies of movement of the disturbance.

The waves forming during the movement of pressures along the surface of a homogen-
eous fluid have been studied quite completely. The author of [6] for the first
time proposed a theory which describes the types of crests in a system of waves
forming on the surface of deep water during movement of a point pressure disturb-
ance with a constant velocity. Then this theory was developed for a fluid of fin-
ite depth [6]. In [1] a study was made of.the development of waves arising during
movement of a region of surface pressures from a state of rest in a deep fluid of
finite depth.

The study of spatial waves generated by surface pressures in flows with a current
velocity variable in depth began relatively recently. Steady waves in a fluid with
a current velocity profile which is linear and constant in direction were examined
in [7), and unsteady waves were examined in [2]. The influence of a change in cur-
rent velocity and its direction with depth on the structure and geometry of the
wave trace was investigated in [3]. I: was found that allowance for the vertical
inhomogeneity of a current leads to some qualitatively new effects in the system
of waves arising beyond the region of pressures. In the case of great current velo-
city drops with depth even in a plane flow the structure of the wave trace differs
substantially from the well-known ship waves and as a result of change in the

22

FOR 0iﬂﬂ€1Al.lﬂﬂE(MVLY
direction of current velocity with depth at the surface of the fluid the wave trace
is deformed in a definite way and becomes asymetric. This article represents a
continuation of the investigations begun earlier in [3]. A study is made of the
influence of current velocity shear on the amplitudes of waves generated by atmo-
spheric pressures moving linearly and uniformly relative to the surface of a fluid.
It is postulated that the current velocity components change linearly with depth.

1. Assume that 'v'o . (uo, v0, 0) is the velocity of the undisturbed flow of a fluid
of the depth H; u and v0 are linear functions of the vertical coordinate 2. As a
convenience we wih assume that V0“) is the sum of current velocity and the velo-

city of pressure movement. The coordinate system was selected in such a way that
its origin was situated on the undisturbed free surface, the z-axis is directed
vertically upward and the direction of the ‘v' (0) Vector coincides with the positive
direction of the Ox-axis. A pressure in the arm

is imparted to the free surface.

In [3] a solution was obtained for} -- rises of the free surface in the form of
double, single integrals and asymptotic formulas not containing integrals. In the
investigation of the dependence of wave amplitudes on the current parameters the
computations were made using formulas containing single integrals. The computation
of double integrals requires great expenditures of computer time and the asymptotic
formulas not containing integrals are not uniformly suitable. In addition, it was
assumed that the time elapsing from the onset of pressures_(l) is quite great and
movement can be considered steady. Computations of the rise of the free surface
were made using the formula

possible to make expression (6) as small as desired. The singularity of the inte-
grand at the point r - to is eliminated by the substitution r - to + u2. The com-
putation of the integrals (2) in the case of high :1 and y1 values requires the
use of quadrature formulas of the Philon type [i] or a great number of nodes in
the Gauss or Simpson formulas. With the use of the last integrals (2) it is pos-
sible for different x1 and y1 to compute the quadrature formulas without scaling
of the weights. In this article we have used the Gauss formulas with the number
of nodes being n = 40 [6]. Hith a parallel organization of the calculations the
computation of the rise of the free surface at 3,600 points required only 5 min-
utes on an "-220 electronic computer. The computations were made for the followb
ing values of the parameters of the problem:

2. Figure 1 gives a general idea concerning the influence of the shear of the
transverse component of current velocity on the wave trace behind the moving
pressure region. The values of the lines of equal deviation 2 from the undisturb-
ed level, shown in the figure, were normalized to the maximum 42 value in the re-
gion 0<x1< 5.5; -2s y1< 2. The current velocity vector turns to the left with
depth. in the direction of a negative direction of the y-axis. The extents of the
conspicuous parts of the corresponding crests and troughs (level lines 10.25) in
the right and left parts of the figure differ by a factor of approximately 2.5.

As follows from the results of the preceding study [3], with an increase in the

B parameter the wave crests and troughs in the right part of the wave trace are
displaced toward the Ox-axis, but never pass beyond it. The computations indicated
that the maximum values of the Z deviations from the undisturbed level are approx-
imately equal to the left and right of the Ox-axis for all values of the parameters
(5). Thus, the transverse current velocity shear can lead to substantial changes

in the phase configuration of the trace.

Figure 2 makes possible a more detailed tracing of changes in the wave trace oc-
curring with a change in the parameter b of shear of the transverse component of
current velocity. As the scale unit along the z-axis we took the maximum value

crease in wave amplitude. In the cross section (Fig. 2,a) the : extrema with an
increase in b are displaced in the direction of the current velocity shear; in this

case the distances between adjacent extrema decrease in the region yJ>0 and in-
crease in the region y<:0. In the longitudinal sections (Pig. 2,b) the z extrema
with an increase in b are displaced to the right (in the direction of greater x

An analysis of the results of computations shows that the transverse velocity
shear, directed in the negative direction of the y-axis, elongates the wave crests
in the region y>0 and turns them toward the Ont-axis (the angle between the crest
and the Oat-axis becomes less). In the region y - 0 the transverse velocity shear
shortens the wave crests and increases the angles between the crests and the 0:-
axis. The lengths of the waves increase in the region y>0 and decrease in the
region y< 0. with an increase in the b parameter the amplitudes of the waves
increase.

3. We will make an analysis of the dependence of the maxim deviations of the free
surface on the values of the parameters a. in)! . The maxim- ]; | values were de-
termined for the region 2<x1< 5, -l.S$ y1< 1.5. The max [Zlvaluas are given in

the tables with an accuracy to the factor po/(Ztrpncz at).

Table 1 gives the results of max]; Icomputations for a - 0 and a series of )(and b
values. The author of [3] gave the critical value of the parameter X - (l + a -
b2)‘1, with transition through which there is a change in the composition of the
wave trace. For a - 0 and 0(b<0.lo the critical 3' value falls in the interval 1
<3!< 1.2. It is interesting that with a fixed value of the!) parameter the aaximum
I4 Ideviations are attained with (J X282, that is, greater than the critical
value. An analysis of the results of computations cited in Table 1 indicates that
for b<0.4 and X‘thhe changes in the maxim deviations of the free surface do

not exceed 10-121. The influence of the transverse shear of current velocity is
greater with large 3' values (or smell velocities of movement of the region of

pressures relative to the free surface). For example, with X- 2 the change in

the maxlé lvalue is 10. 71 with a change in b 0-0.lo and for )(I 6.75 the max|¢lval-
us with b - 0.1. is almost six times greater than the corresponding value with b I-
0. In addition, with a decrease in 3! the changes in the max | & ivalues decrease
with a change in the b parameter. With an increase in the b parameter for all

)( there is also an increase in the maximum deviations of the free surface from
the undisturbed level.

He will examine the joint effect of the influence of shears of the longitudinal
and transverse current velocity components on wave amplitudes. The results of
computations for b - 0.1. 0.2 and a number of values of the a and)! parameters are
given in Table 2. The critical values of the X parameter here fall in the inter-
val 0.86<X<l.32. An analysis of the results of computations shows that with al-
lowance for the shear of the longitudinal component of current velocity the prin-
cipal effect of presence of a shear of the transverse component is reflected in
an increase in the anplitude of waves. The influence of longitudinal shear is
more varied. With small 3! values with an increase in the a parameter there is

an increase in the max II I values; with large)! values the picture is the reverse.
A change in a is reflected to a greater degree in the case of great 2' . The
position of the maximum max Mlvalues (with respect to X ) is dependent on the

a value to a greater degree than on b. With a decrease in a there is an increase
in ﬂat which max|£ Iattains its greatest value. For example. with b - 0.1 and

a - ~0.2 the greatest maxﬂlvalue is attained with 3f- 2.5 and with this same b
value and a - 0.1 with a - 1.75. We also note that these alvalues are greater
than the corresponding X values.

The intensity of shear of the transverse comonent of current velocity v0z exerts
a substantial influence on the phase configuration of the wave trace. Hith an in-
crease in IVOJ the wave crests fron one side of the wave trace (symetrical with
v0; - 0) become longer, and on the other side — shorter. In this case the wave
crests are turned relative to the pressure epicenter in the direction of rotation
of the current velocity vector with depth (Pig. 1).

The maximum displacement of the free surface is an increasing function of the shear
modulus of the transverse conponent of current velocity Ivoz |.

The greatest displacements of the free surface are attained with velocities C
of movement of disturbances less than the velocities of propagation of long waves
(critical).

In the case of small (in comparison with the critical values) velocities of move-
ment of disturbances the maximum displacements of the free surface increase with

an increase in “0:9 the shear of the longitudinal component of current velocity,

and decrease with large C values.

The influence of shear of current velocity on the enlitudes of waves is most con-
spicuous in the case of small velocities of movement of disturbances. For example,
for a c velocity half as great as the critical value the wave amplitudes can change
by a factor of 20 or more with a change in the shear parameters in the intervals
indicated in (5). In addition. the changes in maxim amplitudes of waves do not
exceed 152 for velocities of movement of disturbances greater than the critical
values.

[Article by A. H. Suvorov and A. N. TananayevI

[Text] Abstract: A study was made of the process of de-

velopment of three-dimensional surface waves
generated by moving atmospheric pressure dis-

turbances. Flow velocity is a piecewise-linear
function of the vertical coordinate, which makes
it possible. with a sufficient degree of accur-
acy, to approximate both the direction and velo-
city modulus of real currents in the ocean. The
article gives a method for the analysis of three-
dimensional waves in an N-layer (with respect to
current velocity) sea. The special case with N -
1 is examined.

The theory of ship waves is one of the complex branches of modern hydrodynamics of
the sea (1-4], and at the same time is quite important for practical applications.
Emphasis has been on study of wave movement in a medium at rest in an undisturbed
state or in a fluid flow having a velocity constant in depth. Recently interest has
been shown in investigation of the influence of the vertical structure of currents
on the parameters of three-dimensional waves [5. 6, 13]. In these studies current

velocity was assumed to be a linear function of depth. However, observations show
[7, 9] that one of the characteristic features of horizontal currents in the ocean

is a quite complex dependence of their velocity and direction on depth. In this
article we investigate unsteady three-dimensional surface waves for a piecewise-
1inear vertical profile of flow velocity making it possible with an adequate de-
gree of accuracy to approximate real currents in the ocean.

1. He will examine the flow of an ideal incompressible honogeneous fluid of con-
stant depth unbounded in horizontal directions (see Fig. 1). Here a I -hi(j - 0.1,

...; h - 0) -— the vertical coordinates of the points at which the modu us and
directgon of the velocity vector of the horizontal current are stipulated (for

example. on the basis of oceanic measurement data). In the intervals between these

points the components of the current velocity vector along the x1 and Y1 axes were
approximated by linear functions of depth

It is also assumed that

the derivatives of current velocity at these points can have discontinuities of

Assume that a region of atmospheric pressure disturbances in the form

lated two-dimensional, conditional and

marginal distributions of orbital velo-
cities and Have periods in the Black Sea

and ocean are examined. There was found

to be a change in the characteristics of
the conditional distributions of orbital
velocities in dependence on the ratio of
the specific value of the period to its
mean value according to the wave record.
In computations of the mean orbital velo-
city it is recommended that the experimen-
tal curves of the distribution of orbital
velocities be used. In order to accelerate
computations data are given on the change
in a single parameter of this distribution

as a function of the stage in wave develop-
ment.

The orbital velocity of wind waves can be determined for each wave by computations
if at the same time the height and the period of the wave v1 ' th1/T1 are comput-
ed. Individual v1 values are random values. The description of their statistical

behavior requires a study of the experimental orbital velocity distribution func-
tions ¢?(v). Still more precise information is given by a study of the two-dimen-

sional distributions £9(v,T). At the same time the initial experimental material
obtained from the save records are the heights h1 and periods T1 of the waves,
constituting a system of two random values. This system can be described by a two-
dinensional experimental statistical table of the values at (ho, To), that is, by
the number 2f cases stipulated at equal intervals Aho and 4&0 of the relative val-
ues ho - h/h and To - T/T. Using such a table it is possible to compute the exper-
imental values of the probability density of a two-dimensional distribution "(ho.
To), conditional distributions 9(ho I To) and 9(Tol ho) and the marginal distribu-
tions 9(ho) and W00). These three types of distributions are related to one

Historically it has so happened that the distributions 7(1‘ ) and ‘P(h0) for wind
waves were first studied using oneedimensional series h ans To, whereas the two-
dimensional distribution was found using the multiplica ion theorem. For theoret-
ical computations of ‘f(h0. 10) it is convenient to consider ho and To to be inde-
pendent, that is. assune that 9(h0|1'o) - 9010); then the theores of multiplica-
tion of laws is simplified

Later it was found that the experimental data on ‘P(hol‘l‘ ) do not correspond to the
assumption of a nondependence of this conditional distrigution on To [2]. This

is the reason for the discrepancy between the experimental distributions and the
theoretical distributions, obtained with use of the theorem of multiplication of
laws for independent values. In our recent investigations in the Black Sea the

basis for obtaining different distributions is the initial two-dimensional n1

table having 1 rows for the ho values and 1 columns for the 1'0 values. If it s
taken into account that

In order to obtain an n“ (ho, To) table we used two two-dimensional tables (one of

them included 10079 pairs of ha. '1‘ values, taken from wave records of the Black

Sea, whereas the other included 8916 pairs of ho, To values obtained on voyages

in the Atlantic Ocean [3]). The ho and To values were used in computing v0 - ho/To

and the obtained orbital velocity value V0 is assigned the number of cases of up

These values are given in Table l in parentheses for some To values. It can be
seen that 9(v0 IT ) differs from ‘90]0). Naturally, the statistical characteris-
tics of the conditgonal distributions will also differ from the characteristics of
the marginal distributions, that is, will not be constant, but will change in de-
pendence on the fixed To value. An analysis of 93(vn |To) and the statistical
characteristics of this distribution (such as mean v0, the dispersion Gvoz. the
variation coefficient CW0) was made for the Black Sea and the Atlantic Ocean
(Table 2). The changes in these characteristics are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen
that the considered statistics (statistical characteristics) are not constant but
are dependent on To. Hith To - 0;85 for the Black Seg and with To - 0.7 for the
ocean there is a maxim on the vo(T ) curve. For 6V0 there is a maximal with a
value To - 0.6 for the two considereg regions. The variation coefficient CVVO
changes smoothly from large values in the case of small To, attains values 0.52
with To - 0.8 and then decreases to 0.35 with To - 2. We investigated the experi-
mental marginal distribution (PUG) - ‘f(v)v* for the Black Sea and y(vo) for the

ocean. These distributions are characterized by the following statistics: 30 -
1.03. 6 - 0.27 for the Black Sn; v0 '- 1.010, 63 . 0.26 for the ocean. It can
be seen t t the marginal distributions 50(vo) for 90th water regions are charac-
terized by one and the sane variation coefficient Ovv - 0.52 and the value v0 -
1.03-1.06. The greatest difference 9(vo |1:0) from QQVO) is observed for waves

of short and long periods and the difference is less clearly expressed for periods
close to the average.

probability curves are less than the experimental values (Fig. 3). Such a differ-
ence between the experimental and computed distributions should be expected since
the fundamental assumption of theoretical computations on the equality (f(vo ITO)
- if (v0) does not correspond to the dependence which we obtained between the con-
ditional distributions and their statistical parameters on 1:0, as was mentioned
in the first part of the study.

It was demonstrated earlier in [3] on the basis of an analysis of (PM ), and now
in this article in the example of 'f (v), that the simplified theorem of multiplica-
tion of laws (2) is not applicable to computations of the original distribution of
waves: it can be considered when 9(ho ITO) is unknown. In order to refine such
computations it is necessary to apply the theorem of multiplication of laws in

its general form (1), which agrees with the method which we used in computing dif-
ferent types of distribution on the basis of experimental two-dimensional tables.

Accordingly, experimental curves and tables characterizing different distributions
of orbital velocities are recomended.

As the distribution parameter ‘f(v), changing in dependence on the stage of wave
development, it is possible t3 use va/V. Its numerical value can be precomputed
since it is related to h and 1', whose values are determined on the basis of the
experimental data in [51. Figure} shows the dependence of v*/V on t/V, obtained
from the dependence of h/V2 and IN on t/V. As the latter we took the experimental
dependences [3] for the Black Sea and ocean and the prognostic expressions in the

V. V. Shuleykin method [6]. It can be seen that there is a specific difference in
the course of development of waves in the Black Sea and ocean.

In conclusion we will generalize the scheme for computing orbital velocities. 0n
the basis of the wave-forming factors V, t and x we determine t/V and x/Vz. If
on the x-scale (Fig. lo) x/V2<t/V, the waves must be considered as not developed,

but rather developing [7] and the V*/V values are determined in this case on the
basis of t/V. Computations of well-developed waves are made from the dependence

of v,/V on x/VZ. Since the wind is stipulated, the numerical value of v*/V and V
makes it possible to determine the numerical value Va - Vv*/V. Then we determine
v - ,8 v... 0n the basis of known v and the fa)! values we determine 90(v), giving
the probability of all values of specific v - Vv/V different from v. Using Fig. 3
we also determine the guaranteed probability of specific values of orbital velo-
cities. Such a prediction thus gives not only the mean orbital velocity. but all
its other values in this stage of wave development with an indication of their
probability.

[Text] Abstract: The effect of the geometry of
pressure disturbances on the amplitude
of generated capillary-gravitational
waves at the surface of a homogeneous
ideal incompressible fluid of infinite
depth is investigated. The pressure dis-
turbance is modeled by a normal stress
changing harmonically with time. The
article examines the case of generation
of surface waves by a platform of ice
of finite width oscillating under the
influence of a pressure disturbance at
its surface. In this problem the pressure
of the platform on the fluid is an un-
known function and is determined by solu-
tion of a mixed problem. ‘

Capillary-gravitational waves caused by surface normal pressures have been studied
by the authors of [1, 3, 15]. Problems relating to forced oscillations and diffrac-
tion in the presence of a plate of finite width without allowance for surface ten-
sion were investigated in [1, 2, 14]. The influence of surface tension and the
finiteness of depth was examined in [9].

With small values of the parameters (JZa/g, OCK/Dgaz the pressure developed at the
fluid surface by the ice platform is close to hydrostatic (Pig. 2). The high-fre-
quency asymptote of the dynamic part of the pressure is analyzed using the for-
mulas (3.3), (3.9). (3.12). The results of the work are in qualitative agreement
with [1, 2]. The main conclusion is that pressure distributed over the entire area
of the fluid (3.5) causes traveling waves of lesser amplitude than concentrated
pressures when there is an identical total force.

[Text] Abstract: A study was made of the process of
development of waves from impulse disturbances
in a sea covered with ice. Ice compression and
dilatation are taken into account. It is demon-
strated that ice compression increases and dilat-
ation decreases the time required for waves to
pass through a stipulated point. In addition,
ice compression can lead to the formation of
compression waves not arising in the absence
of compressive forces. The conditions for gener-
ation of these waves were determined and the
dependence of their elements on the magnitude
of the compressive force were determined.

Unsteady oscillations of the ice cover in the absence of dilatational and com-
pressive forces were investigated in [l-3]. The development of flexural-grevita-
tional waves. caused by periodic disturbances under conditions of longitudinal
dilatation, was studied in [4], and in the case of longitudinal compression in

[5].

In this article we give an analysis of the influence of longitudinal compression

and dilatation on waves from impulse disturbances. As the wave generator we will
examine a small displacement of a sector of the bottom of the basin occurring with
the vertical velocity

beginning from the moment in time t - 0. The investigation was carried out on the

assumption that prior to the onset of exposure to disturbance the fluid is at
rest and the ice-water surface is horizontal. The velocity potential‘f of wave
movement of the fluid under conditions of lengitudinal dilatation [2,6] is de—

termined from the equation

Here the subscript 1 on t1 - t - to has been omitted. From (1.5), using the station-

ary phases method, we find an asymptotic expression forZ . The presence of station-

ary points for the phase functions H1.2(r) with fixed V is determined by the be-
havior of the function 13'(r). Its dependence on the aagnitude of the dilatational

force is similar to the dependence of the frontal velocity of nonattenuating waves
generated by disturbances which are periodic in tine. It was studied in [6] and is
illustrated there in Fig. 2. It follows fron the data in the figure that Hz with
V‘1<u does not have stationary points (true roots of the equation H2'(r) " 0).
For V' > “1 and u2< V‘1< “1 the stationary points will be r - r2 and r - r1, r -

Accordingly, the wave Z2, caused by elastic forces, arrives at a fixed point earl-
ier than the gravitational wave Z1, in this case not having a clearly expressed
leading edge. The leading edge of the gravitational waves moves from the epicenter

of the disturbances with the velocity u1. The trailing edges of the elastic and
gravitational waves coincide with one another and move with the identical velocity

“2' dependent on the ice thickness, the modulus of normal elasticity of the ice
and the magnitude of the dilatational force. A large dilatational force also cor-

responds to a high velocity of the trailing edge. Qualitatively there is the same
character of the dependence of uz on ice thickness.

In a general case it is impossible to find an analytical expression for the sta-

tionary points (roots of the equations Hi 2(r) - 0) as functions of x and t, but
numerically they can be found with the reduired degree of accuracy with stipulated

x and t and thus it is possible to form a quantitative picture of the change in

; with the cOurse of time at an arbitrary fixed point and the pattern of waves at
a fixed moment in time.

changing with an adequately small interval r and taking into account that in the
intervals (0. to) and (to, 00) the dependence between t and r is mutually unambig—
uous and that time increases with an increase in r in the interval (0, to), but
with an increase in r in 60,00) decreases, it is possible without finding the

tive to t for x - 103m in the case of a deltalike displacement of a sector of the

Q - 0. With other Q the pattern is qualitatively similar. The curves 1, 2 in Fig-
ures 3, a relate to thickness of the ice plate 1 and 2 n.

The extreme right values of each of the curves in Figures 2, 4 correspond to the
moments in time close to the moment of passage of the trailing edge of the waves
through a stipulated point. The extreme left points of the curves in Figures 1, 3
characterize the amplitude in the neighborhood of the trailing edge at a fixed
moment in time. In this neighborhood the asymptotic formulas (1.6) do not apply,
but the 4 2 computed from them assumes an infinitely large value.

An analysis of the data in Figures 1-6 shows that with the course of time the ver—
tical amplitude of the oscillations 2.2(t) increases. The time for passage of the
waves (1.6) through a stipulated point decreases with an increase in the dilata-
tional force. It also decreases with an increase in the thickness of the ice plate.
At a fixed moment in time the oscillations caused by elastic waves attenuate with
distance from the epicenter of the disturbances both with an increase in h and with
an increase in the dilatational force. The influence of longitudinal dilatation

with a fixed force is manifested more clearly in the case of a lesser ice thick-
ness.

2. Now we will analyze the process of development of waves arising under the in-
fluence of small vertical displacements of a sector of the bottom under ice com-
pression conditions [2, 6, 7]. The generated wave movement is determined by the
velocity potential ‘I satisfying the Laplace equation (1.2). initial and boundary
conditions (1.3) at thebottgmand

Solving the problem as in the case of longitudinal dilatation, for Z we obtain the
integral representation (1.4), where it mat be assumed that 91 - 1 - q r2 + n1
r”. For a deltalike function (#0) the integral (1.10) is reduced to (1.5}, which
we compute by the stationary phases method with Q1< 2/111, necessary for stability
of the ice plate [2].

Assume that Q1< Q0, where Q is determined by the same expression as in [5]. Under
such a condition the phase gunctions H1,2(r) behave qualitatively the sane as under
longitudinal dilatation conditions. This is attributable with the given condition
to the qualitatively similar behavior of t(r) for dilatational and compressive
forces. In the first case t(r) coincides with 5(r) in Fig. l in [lo], and in the
second case with 6 (r) in Fig. 1 in [S], where the upper two curves are given for
Q1, satisfying the condition Q < 00. A comparison of these figures, and also Fig.

2 from [6] with Pig. 14,!) from {5], shows that in this case the condition of existence
of stationary points for the phase functions M1 2 (r) in the case of compressive

forces Q<P9Q0 is the same as in the case of dilatational forces. Accordingly, the
type of ice-water surface under ice compression conditions with Q<f>5Qo is deter-

mined. as in the case of dilatation, by formulas (1.6). A greater compressive

force corresponds to a lesser velocity u2 of the trailing edge of the Z 1 and Z 2
waves. The velocity ul of the leading edge of gravitational waves 11 is not depen-
dent on 0- "he dependence of 02 on the magnitude of the compressive force is clear-
ly seen in Pig. lo,b in [5], where with Q< Q0 it is characterized by minimum values
on the upper two curves u(r) and t'(r), cited for the compressive forces 0 (upper
curve) and 1.68-106 N/m respectively.

The influence of ice compression on the values of the local phase velocities (1 (r)
lr)and lengths (UT/r) of the developing waves is illustrated in [5] by the upper
two curves in Pig. (he and Fig. lo,b respectively. The segments of the curves to
the left of the minimum in the second of them are related to zl, whereas to the
right -- to z 2. It can be seen that with fixed v- c/ lxl the local length 2,1 -
2n/r1 of the g 1 wave increases, whereas A2 - 21r/r2 of the 2.2 wave decreases
with an increase in the cowressive force Q. We have ”<31 <00, 0< 32‘ A0,
where )0, equal to 251/1'0. decreases with an increase in the compressive force.
The gravitational ; 1 and elastic [2 waves with fixed local lengths have greater
local phase velocities with a lesser compressive force. We note that the influence
of the longitudinal compression on the examined wave characteristics is the oppo-
site of the influence of longitudinal dilatational forces on them.

For an observer at the fixed point x the time of passage of elastic and gravita-
tional waves increases with an increase in the compressive force. The greater the
Q value, the trailing edge will be at a lesser distance from the epicenter of the

disturbances at a stipulated moment in time. The vertical amplitude of oscilla-
tions of the functions Z 20:) and Z 2(t) decreases with an increase in Q.

Assume that Q0<Q1<2,/E_. Then for x>0 the phase function N1(r) - r + V (t) has

[Text] Abstract: An attempt to find a correlation
between the height of tsunamis at the shore
and in the open ocean (at the tsunami focus)
for Burevestnik village (Iturup Island) on
the basis of computed and actual data on the
height of tsunamis is described.

A complexity in predicting the height of a tsunami wave is that at the present
time there is no real possibility, on the basis of the known magnitude of an
earthquake, to obtain the necessary information on the field of wave disturbances
at the focus of a tsunami. Measurements of the height of a tsunami wave at the
focus are unavailable. However, in [2, 3, 7, 8] an attempt is made to establish
a correlation between the magnitude of an earthquake and the height of a tsunami
at the focus.

As a result of modeling it was possible to find the dependence between the basin
depth, the maximum displacement of the bottom and the maximum rise at the source
[7]. In studying the Niigata tsunami a correlation was established between the
magnitude of the earthquake and the wave height at the source [8]. 0n the basis of
an analysis of the results of theoretical investigations by Takshasi, Ichiye, Kad-
shiura, L. N. Sretenskiy, A. S. Stavrovskiy, it was demonstrated in [3] that in
the region of the tsunami source the wave height can be assumed equal to the val-
ue of the vertical displacement of the bottom sector in the region of the earth-
quake focus. Source [2], in the form of a,table, gives the dependence of tsunami
height at the focus on earthquake magnitude and focal depth.

We will examine an analytical-numerical method making it possible to compute the
height of the tsunami wave at the shore. The model of a basin filled with a fluid
consists of a region of an ocean of a constant depth hl, transitional to a zone

of variable depth h2(x) and ending at the shore in a vertical wall. The x-axis is

directed from the open sea to the shore. the z-axis is directed upward, the y-axis
is directed along the shore. Within the framework of this model, using an analyt-
ical-numerical method, the tsunami wave heights are computed along the shore.

In this article, for Burevestnik village (Iturup Island), on the basis of com-
puted and actual data on the height of a tsunami, an attempt has been made to
find a correlation between the height of a tsunami at the shore and in the open
ocean (at the tsunami focus).

In the approximation of the linear theory of long waves, with allowance for the ac-
tion of Coriolis force. the systes of equations has the form

where z is the rise in the level of the free surface; 3, 3 are the components of
horizontal velocity; 2“) is the Coriolis parameter; h is basin depth 0'1 -- in the
open ocean, hz -- in the shore zone).

The rise of the free surface for a tusunami wave running in at an angle from the
open ocean has the form

where A is the amplitude of this wave; m, n are the components of the wave vector
on the x, y axes; b is the frequency of this wave. Using the periodicity condi-
tions and seeking a solution of system (1) in the form

for determining the rise of the free surface in a region of variable depth 12 and
in the open ocean 21 the ordinary differential equations are

where A2. 8 are arbitrary constants; ‘77 and 4" are two fundamental solutions of

For the rise in the free surface in the open ocean 2'1 and in the coastal zone (-2

Here A1 is the amplitude of the wave arriving from the abyssel region (we will

consider it to be fixed); B is the amplitude of the wave reflected in the abys-
ssl region; the expression in brackets is the amplitude of a wave (dependent on

x) moving along the shore in the coastal zone.

In order to find 31- A2, 32 we will use the continuity conditions for the free sur-
face profile and the horizontal velocities at the boundary of regions of constant
and variable depth, and also the condition at the vertical wall. These conditions
make it possible to obtain a system of three algebraic equations whose solution
gives the sought-for values.

For Burevestnik village the proposed method was used in computing the rise of the
level surface with approach of the tsunami wave to the shore. The basin model re-
flects its longitudinal section perpendicular to the shore. The depth of the open

ocean is hl - 6 km. The zone of variable depth is broken down into regions whose
depth and extent in each case with approach to the shore are hz - 2, l, 0.5. 0.6,

0.005 kn; L1 ' 60.5, 16.5, 242, 99, 103 km.

The computations were made for waves whose amplitude in the open ocean was 1 m,

the periods being 107, 40, 33 minutes. The choice of periods is explained by the
observational data. It is known [1, 4] that with passage of a tsunami precisely

these periods predominate in the spectrum of ocean level fluctuations.

Source [4] gives the spectra of ocean level fluctuations with the passage of the
close and distant tsunaais of 28 March-January 6, 1964, 14-16 May, 1966, 16-18 May

1968, 11-13 March, 1969, 22-25 September, 1969. Here it is also indicated that
with the passage of distant tsunamis a long-period component appears in the spec-
trum which is absent in the spectrum of variations caused by near tsunamis.

The computations indicated that with the arrival of a tsunami wave from the open
ocean at an angle to the shore, with an amplitude of 1 m and a period of 107 (dis-
tant tsunami), 60, 33 minutes (near tsunami) a wave is propagated along the shore
whose amplitude is greater (by 602 for a distant tsunami and by 702 for a near tsu-
nami) than the amplitude of the arriving wave. Since the wave is propagated along
the shore, it can be regarded as an edge wave whose amplitude is 1/2-1/4 of the
total amplitude.

In [6] a study was made of the record of level variations during the passage of
waves during the Iturup tsunami (1958, 1963). It was demonstrated that the varia-
tions include a special component whose transformation in the transformation pro-
cess is characteristic for edge waves on the shelf. The amplitude of these waves
is 0.5-0.25 of the total amplitude and the maximum value is observed in those
cases when the total group of waves approaches at an angle to the shelf. Thereby

a wave component is excited which moves away from the shore along the normal with
an amplitude up to 1/3 of the magnitude of the edge shelf waves.

Taking into account the conclusions in [6], we will assume that the maximum ampli-
tude with approach of a tsunami to the shore, having an amplitude in the ocean of
l m, will be 7 m (for a near tsunami) and 6 m (for a distant tsunami). A wave will

71

be reflected from the shore whose amplitude is 0.6 m (for a close tsunami) and
0.5 m (for a distant tsunami).

By comparing in situ observations of height of the wave (0.103 I) registered by the
tide gage at Burevestnik village on 12 August 1969 with the passage of a tsunami
(earthquake magnitude 8.2) [5] with the computed height (6 m),with the arrival of
a wave with the amplitude 1 m from the abyssal region, for the actual tsunami we
obtain an amplitude of the arriving wave or the wave height of the wave at the
tsunami source of 0.2 n. Thus, the amplitude of the tsunami wave with approach

to the shore increases by a factor of 6.

For other actual tsunamis [5] (28 March 1964, 15 May 1966, 16 May 1968, 23 November
1969) there was registry of amplitudes of variations several times less (0.62,
0.15, 0.2, 0.45 m respectively) than during the tsunami event of 12 August 1969;
accordingly, the height of the tsunami at the source for them will be considerably

less (0.02-0.1 m).

GENERATION OF SEISMIC WAVES BY TSUNAMI WAVES PROPAGATING IN OCEAN WITH

[Article by I. V. Lavrenov]

[Text] This article is devoted to the problem of
short-range forecasting of tsunamis. The mech-
anism of generation of seismic waves in the
earth's crust by tsunamis is examined. The
resonance conditions for generation are re-
vealed in an examination of the interaction

of tsunami waves with irregularities on the
ocean floor. The spectrum of Rayleigh waves
is constructed in a case when tsunamis are
propagated in an ocean whose bottom relief
changes in one direction. The radiation of
seismic waves has a directional character.

The problem of seismic waves generated by tsunamis has a direct relationship to
the problem of short-range forecasting of tsunamis. This problem was raised for
the first time in 1956 by L. N. Sretenskiy in [1]. Then it was examined by S. S.
Voit in [8]. In these studies it was assumed that tsunamis during movement in
an ocean with an elastic plane bottom excite seismic waves which are propagated
considerably more rapidly than tsunamis. 0n the basis of observation of seismic
waves it would be possible to judge the presence and character of tsunamis,
thereby obtaining preliminary information for some time prior to the arrival of
tsunami waves on the shore.

In source [2] a study was made of seismic waves generated by a tsunami, taking
into account an analysis of elastic displacements of the earth's crust caused
by tsunamis propagating at an angle to the shoreline.

In this article we examine the possible mechanism which would describe the gen-
eration of seismic waves by tsunami waves propagating in an ocean with an uneven
bottom.

1. Assume that in a rectangular coordinate system (x, y, 2) an elastic medium with
zz>-h(x,y,z) is stipulated which is covered by a layer of homogeneous fluid ~[ho

y,t) is a function describing bottom relief; q(x,y,t) is the deviation of the

free surface level of the fluid from the position of equilibrium (Fig. 1).

We will examine the wave movement of such a dynamic system. He will assume that
bottom elasticity does not exert a significant influence on the propagation of
fluid waves and that the height of the bottom irregularities is small in compar-
ison with the mean depth of the basin |h(x,y,t)|<’ l and the slopes of the irreg-
ularities are small lgrad h(x,y,t)l<l.

On these assuwtions the problem of wave movement of a fluid leads to the problem
of wave propagation at the surface of a fluid in the presence of an uneven bortom.
He will assme that the wave movement of the free surface of a fluid is described
by the theory of long waves

The effect of the ocean on the bottom will be simulated by a system of normal
pressures applied to the bottom from the direction of the ocean. Since an uneven

Thus, a system of linear equations with variable coefficients (1.1)-(1.4) is ob-
tained. The wave equation (1.1) can be considered independently of (l.2)-(l.4).
The solution of the remaining system of equations is obtained using equation
(1.1).

The problem of the scattering of tsunami waves in an ocean with an uneven bottom
has already been examined in the literature. For example, in [3] its solution was

obtained in the approximation of the theory of long waves. Accordingly, we will
not dwell on a detailed investigation of solution of equation (1.1). We note only

that the presence of bottom irregularities. whose height is considerably less than
the mean depth of the ocean, leads to an attenuation of the mean wave field of long
gravitational waves.

It follows from expression (2.14) that a resonance (linear in time) increase in
the spectrum of Rayleigh waves occurs only in a case when in the spatial-tempor-
al spectra of components of the stress field there is a set of frequencies and
wave vectors corresponding to the dispersion relationship for these waves. A

contribution to the spectral density of Rayleigh waves 13 made by both the auto-
spectrum of the stress field, but also the cross-spectrm of stress components.

Formula (2.14) is a singular generalization of [7] in which the generation of wind
waves was studied.

In a linear formulation, without allowance for topography, the pressure field act-
ing on the bottom does not afford the necessary conditions for the generatign of
seismic waves since in the latter case the frequent: wand the wave number k are
related by the dispersion relationship a! 2 - 91: th 0’ which does not allow the
phase velocity to exceed the lgho value. Accordingly, the pressure spectrum does
not contain the totality of frequencies and wave vectors corresponding to Rayleigh
waves. We note that the restnance conditions for the generation of seismic waves
are revealed not only in an examination of interactions of surface gravitational
waves with bottom relief , but also in an analysis of nonlinear wave interactions
between gravitational waves [5]. However, the mechanism of generation of seismic
waves in the latter case is less effective for tsunami waves affecting with their
wave movement the entire water layer of the ocean.

The mechanism of generation of Rayleigh waves, examined above, gives the same
local increase in wave energy as that generated by the quasistationary and quasi-
homogeneous field of limiting stress. In the latter case the spectrum‘l-‘13(I¢',w)
from (2.110) is also a function of distance and time. The spectrum 8n(k,z,t) is de-
termined not only by expression (2.16), but also by the energy related to inhomo-
geneity and nonstationary character of the distribution of the external field
spectrum. Equation (2.1“ is written in a more complete form, as was demonstrated

in [lo]. . .

As an example of the integration of (2.17) we will examine a simple case (Fig.2)

where Tn is constant with respect to both t and ? in some region with the given

tion region to the observer is R, 9’0 is the angle between the ox—axis and the di-
rection to the center of the region. If A80 is the path of propagation of the Ray-
leigh wave with the wave vector k, then the spectrum Sn increases linearly from the

3. He will examine the boundary conditions in the formulation of the problem (1.2)
and (1.3). He will investigate only those components of stress which contain spec-
tral components with high phase velocities satisfying the resonance conditions of
generation of Rayleigh waves. Accordingly, we will limit ourselves only to the tan-
gential stresses (1.3), since the normal component of stress (1.2) is not capable
of generating seismic waves by reason of the factors indicated above.

We will write an expression for the spectral intensity of the field of shearing
stresses (1.3). For this we will expand the wave fields QG’J) and 5 (r) (as this
was demonstrated in [3]) into Fourier integrals. Applying (2.11) and (2.15) and
limiting ourselves only to the main term, containing the small parameter E (r) in
the lowest power, we obtain

where 60 is the angle between the direction of roughness and the oat-axis.

In order to obtain some idea abOut seismic waves generated in such a special case
it is also necessary to stipulate the spectrum of tsunami waves. However, here it
is difficult to stipulate any specific-spectrum. The evaluations cited by

different authors for the time being have an extremely ambiguous character for

one and the same case. The principal difficulty in determining the basic parameters
is related to the complexity in the precise registry of tsunami waves in the coast-
al zone, especially at the epicenter. We will assume that (a(k1)a* (k )) is dependent
only on the modulus of the wave vector (as a rule, such vectors can eseribe tsur
namis arising from the initial deviation of the free surface of the ocean when the
form of this deviation is symmetric relative to the vertical axis passing through
the epicenter).

If is assumed that the isolines of bottom irregularities are situated along the oy-
axis, the examined case is easily illustrated. From the entire stress field acting
on the bottom it is possible to discriminate only one main stress component which
also for the most part determines the field of seismic waves at great distances.

It is determined by the shearing stress along the ox-axis since only in this direc-
tion is there a change in bottom topography.

Thus, as a result of the substitution of the values (4.1) and (3.1) into (2.19)
for distances considerably exceeding the characteristic dimensions of the genera-
tion region. it is possible to obtain the spectra of the components of displace-
ments in the Rayleigh wave. For example, for the horizontal component we obtain

The radiation of Rayleigh waves has a directed character for a stipulated type of
relief (Pig. 4). The radiation maximum falls primarily in the direction of the

strongest change in bottom relief. In the full spectrum of the Rayleigh wave there
is a predominance of a spectrum with a vertical displacement component.

The spectra of the Rayleigh wave components obtained in such a way give some idea
concerning the directivity of the seismic precursors of tsunami waves. According
to the proposed mechanism for the generation of seismic waves their excitation oc-
curs when tsumamis encounter ocean bottom irregularities on their path. Participat-
ing in the generation are only quite extended bottom irregularities, as follows
from resonance conditions. In a case when the correlation spectrum of bottom ir-

regularities is nonisotropic, the radiation of seismic waves can have a direction-
al character.

[Text] Abstract: Within the framework of the linear
theory of long waves in a homogeneous fluid a
study was made of the influence of friction on

the process of development of wave movement
caused by axisylmetric disturbances. The latter

are characterized by both displacement of the
free surface and by some velocity field. The
analysis rests on computations of the integrals.
Vertical friction is considered to be propor-
tional to the mean integral horizontal velocity
of movement; horizontal friction is taken into
account in general form.

A large number of studies have been devoted to an investigation of waves from in-
itial disturbances. A review of the results obtained by analytical and numerical
methods in this region is contained in [1-7] and elsewhere. In this article we ex-
amine the problem of the evolution of an axisymmetric rise or velocity field in
a homogeneous fluid, with viscosity being taken into account. We used vertically
averaged equations of long waves in which horizontal friction is taken into ac-

count in general form and vertical friction is considered proportional to the mean
integral horizontal velocity of motion. The analysis rests on numerical computa-

tion of the integrals. A similar investigation for an ideal fluid was made in [8];
plane waves in a viscous fluid were examined in [9].

1. He will er zine a layer of a viscous incompressible homogeneous fluid of the
constant deptn H, unbounded in horizontal directions. At the time t - 0 the rise
of the free surface of the fluid and the velocity field are known. Within the

framework of the linear theory of long waves, with allowance for Coriolis force,
we will investigate the developing unsteady motion of the fluid.

The mathematical formulation of the problem includes the system of three equations

In [8] an analysis was given of the velocity field and the form of the free sur-
face of an ideal homogeneous rotating fluid caused by initial axisyuuetrie dis-
turbances. It is shown that they cause the formation of time-attenuating annular
waves and some stationary barotropic eddy at the center of the disturbance. Below
we give an analysis of the influencv of horizontal and vertical friction on the
process of generation of these waves and time-attenuation of the indie ted eddy

formation.

Now we will examine the influence of vertical friction on the process of evolution
of the initial rise of the free Surface of the fluid and tangential veloeities

(r 7‘- 0, A - 0). Curve 1 in Fig. 1 gives the shape of the generated wave for the

initial riselo in the form (1.11). Its profile is characterized by a rising wave
and by a dropping wave which follows it. A comparison of curves 1, 2 in Fig. 1 re-

veals that vertical friction does not lead to qualitative changes in the shape of
the wave but its amplitude value can be substantially reduced. This effect, as
might be expected. is intensified with an increase in the vertical friction coef-
ficient r. For example, if the value 2*'- max |Z(R,t)|at the time t - 30 min with
r - o is equal to 0.137 m, then with r - 10", 210-“, 3-10'“. 10-3 sec'1 1: can
decrease to 0.123: 0.115; 0.107; 0.067 m respectively. With an increase in t the
difference in the amplitudes of the 4* waves with r - 0 and r + 0 is intensified.
This conclusion is illustrated in the table, where column 1 gives the Z*'values
with r - 0 and column 2 gives theli* values with r - 2-10" sec‘l.

Figure 2,a illustrates the influence of vertical friction on the field of the tan-
gential component of the velocity vector v* - V3. The curve marked with the symbol

00 describes the v* distribution in a stationary geostrophic eddy arising from
the initial rise of the free surface of an ideal fluid. It can be seen that in a

viscous fluid this eddy attenuates with time. With an increase in the friction co-
efficient r the attenuation of the eddy is intensified and accordingly the life-

time of the eddy is reduced. We note that allowance for vertical friction exerts
no influence on the position of the maximum V3 value.

It was demonstrated in [8] that any initial distribution of tangential velocity
(v3) in an ideal fluid in the case of long waves virtually does not change in time.

The transpiring insignificant changes in hydrodynamic characteristics are attrib-
utable only to the effect of Coriolis force. Under the influence of vertical fric-
tion, with an increase in t the initial distribution of the tangential component
of the velocity vector is considerably deformed, as can be seen from a comparison
of curves 1, 2 (Fig. 3). With an increase in t the amplitude values v* ' v2 de«
crease, but the position of the maximum value, as in the case of the initial dis-
placement of the fluid surface, to all intents and purposes persists. Numerical
computations made it possible to estimate the lifetime of such eddies. For example,
with r - 3°10'4 sec‘1 a decrease in the maximum velocity value by a factor of 10
occurs during a time interval of about 2 hours.

3. We will examine the influence of horizontal friction on the process of evolu-
tion of the initial rises of the free surface and the field of tangential velo-
cities (r - 0, A 15 0). Horizontal friction, like vertical friction, favors a more
rapid decrease in the amplitudes of the main wave and the descending wave in com-
parison with the case of an ideal fluid. A comparison of curves 1, 3 (Fig. 1)
reveals that horizontal friction leads to some "spraying" of the wave in a radial
direction. The dependence of the amplitude of the main wave 2* (m) on time t (min)
with r - 0, A - 5-104 mZ-secrl is given in column 3 in the table. With an increase
in A the attenuation of L+ with time will evidently occur more rapidly.

Figure 2,b shows the process of evolution of the field of tangential velocity

caused by an initial rise of the free surface. It can be seen that with time due
to horizontal friction, as well as due to vertical friction, there is a decrease

in the amplitude values V3 and entry into a stationary geostrophic regime of move-
ment does not occur. In contrast to the case r -ﬁ 0, A - 0 under the influence of
horizontal friction the position max |v3(R)| with time is displaced into the re-
gion of high R values. 3

Horizontal friction also exerts a substantial influence on the initial distribu-
tion of the tangential component of the velocity vector, as follows from a compar-
ison of curves 1, 3 (Fig. 3). It can be seen that the amplitude values v* - v2 de-
crease and the position max iv2(R) Iis displaced in the direction of high R val-
ues. Computations show that with an increase in the A coefficient the field of
tangential velocity attenuates more rapidly and therefore the lifetime of the eddy
decreases. It is several hours. For example, with A - 105 m2~sec'1 for t - 2 hours

4. We will examine the joint effect of vertical and horizontal friction (r sh 0,

A at 0). An analysis indicated that the joint influence of vertical and horizontal
friction leads to a decrease in the amplitudes of the head wave and decreasing
wave and also to a "spraying" of the first in a horizontal direction. This is in-
dicated by a comparison of curves 1 and 4 (Fig. 1). Have attenuation, as might be
expected, with A 75 0 and r wk 0 is mor. significant than when only vertical fric-
tion is considered or only horizontal friction. This is seen clearly also from the
table given in section 2, in which column 4 gives the numerical values.4*'(n) for
r - 2-10'4 sec'l, A - 5-10‘ mZ-sec'l. the computations also show that in general

a change of the r coefficient exerts a considerably greater influence on the wave
characteristics than a change in the A coefficient by the same number of times.

The joint influence of horizontal and vertical friction on the process of evolution
of the initial distribution of the tangential component of the velocity vector v

is illustrated by curves 1 and 4 (Fig. 3). It can be seen that with an increase n
t under the influence of friction the amplitude values v* - v2 decrease and the
position wﬁx ‘v2(R)I is displaced in the direction of large R, as occurred due to
horizontal friction. How;ver, this decrease in v2 with one and the same parameters
of the problem exceeds the corresponding change occurring with allowance for hori-
zontal friction alone.

[Text] Abstract: The author gives the derivation of
an equation for the complex amplitude of a
wave taking into account the influence of
viscosity, the ,8- effect, bottom relief and
wave shearing stresses. simple formulas are
derived for wave velocities, taking into ac-
count the surface and bottom friction layers,
as well as formulas for wave shearing stress-
es expressed through periodic fluctuations
of atmospheric pressure. It has been estab-
lished that the influence of viscosity and the
ﬁ-effect is manifested for the most part in
the resonance region and leads to a change
in the resonance amplitudes and frequencies.

It is known that atmospheric disturbances at the ocean surface [1-3] are one of
the important sources of generation of internal waves in the ocean. At the same
time, in the upper surface layer of the ocean, due to allowance for turbulent
friction, there can be intensive turbulent wave movements caused by fluctuations
of atmospheric pressure. In most studies [1, 3, 4] devoted to an investigation of
the boundary layers and generation of internal waves only the bottom boundary
layer is taken into account and also the baundary layers forming at the discon-
tinuities of a multilayer fluid. At the ocean surface it is customary to stipul-
ate the normal stresses and shearing stresses are usually not taken into account
at all [1-4] or are taken into account but are not related to fluctuations of
atmospheric pressure [5, 8, 12].

In this article we give the derivation of an equation for the complex amplitude of
a wave and formulas for wave velocities, taking into account the surface and bottom
friction layers, and investigate the joint influence of viscosity and theﬂ—effect
on the generation of long waves in the ocean by atmospheric waves.

within the framework of the linear theory of long waves, with allowance for ver-

to be periodic, we will write the initial equations in the form

We will assume that H - 1000 m, 9’- 30°, p0 - 100 Pa. It follows from (26) that
resonance sets in with I >1, that is, with a space frequency higher than Ito and
a phase close to 90'. Since q-r<< 1, the shift is small. With [I 1 the amplitude
already decreases by a factor ofﬂ and the phase is equal to 45'. Here and in the

text which follows A and AP are indicated in centimeters.

The figure shows the dependence of the dimensionless amplitudes (p0 - (pog)'Po)
on the dimensionless space frequency J . The dashed curves 1'.2', corresponding

to periods of 2 and 3 hours, were computed in the presence of viscosity; the solid
curves l-lo, relating to 3 hours, for 9 equal to 0, 90, 180 and 270°, were obtain-
ed taking into account both viscosity and the B—effect. It can be seen that allow-
ance for vertical turbulent viscosity leads to a shift in the resonance curves to
the right (to the left if the dependence of dimensionless wave amplitude on the
dimensionless time frequency K - 0/00 [2] is examined). This shift increases with
an increase in the period, but the wave amplitude decreases. As a result of the

joint effect of viscosity and the ﬁ-effect, even for identical periods, in depend-
ence on the 9 angle, there is a change in wave amplitude and a shift of the reson-
ance curves.

For example, if the wave propagated to the east (5- 0) the resonance curve 1 is
shifted to the right relative to the dashed curve 2', computed in the absence of
the ﬂ-effect. For a wave propagating to the west (9- 180°) the shift of curve 3
occurs to the left. Their resonance amplitudes are virtually identical. If the
ane is propagated to the scuth or north there is no shift of the resonance
curves but the resonance amplitude with 9- 90° (curve 2) is less, whereas with
- 270° (curve lo) it is greater than when only viscosity is taken into account.
With an increase in the wave period these differences become greater. This also
corresponds to an increase in the circles, one of which, with '1' - 3 hours, repre-
sented by the dashed line, is shown in this figure. Each point taken on it cor-
responds to the resonance amplitude value computed with a smooth change in the
0 angle from O to 360'. An analysis of the results of computations shows that the
influence of viscosity, and also the joint influence of viscosity and the ﬂ-ef-
feet on wave amplitude, is manifested for the most part in the region close to
resonance (0.98$J$1.02). Beyond it these effects are not significant (all the
curves for different periods and angles virtually merge). With respect to wave
phase, with {<{ it is negative, whereas with 173’ it is positive, that is, a
wave generated 1 the ocean with an increase in 1 first lags in phase behind the
atmospheric wave and then for K > Xp begins to "outpace" it, changing very rapid-
ly at 180' with 3" KP. We note that all the curves in the figure were computed in
the presence of wave shearing stresses in (22). However, allowance for them does
not lead to a substantial increase in wave amplitude for the considered periods,
but is more important in computing the velocity of the wave current.

Now we will clarify how a change in the Coriolis parameter exerts an influence 0::
wave amplitude. It was demonstrated in [1] that for free oscillations, correspond-
ing to small periods of about l-8 hours, a change in the Coriolis parameter exerts
little influence on the wave amplitude. For forced oscillations such will be the
case only far from resonance, whereas near it the role of the Coriolis parameter
increases.

The table gives the values of the resonance amplitudes A” (T - 2 hours, 5+ 0) as
a function of latitude 7 for four values of the gangle', equal to 0, 90, 180 and
270°. The figures in parentheses correspond to 3’ P values corresponding to these
resonance amplitudes. it can be seen that if the wave is propagated to the west or
east, its amplitude varies little with latitude. However, the greater the lati-
tude, the greater will be the {value at which resonance is attained for 9- 180°
and the lesser will be the I value for 9- 0°. If the wave is propagated to the
south or north, resonance is attained with virtually identical 3 values, but with
an increase in latitude the wave amplitude for 0' 90° first decreases and in the
region of the middle latitudes attains a minimum value, and then increases. 0n the

other hand, for an angle 9- 270° the resonance amplitude of the wave attains a
maximum value near the middle latitudes.

Summary

An equation was derived for the complex amplitude of a wave taking into account
the influence of viscosity, the ﬁ-effect and variable ocean depth. Simple for—
mulas were also derived for the veloeity components of a wave current, taking the

surface and bottom friction layers into account,and for wave shearing stresses
caused by periodic fluctuations of atmospheric pressure.

It is shown that the influence of viscosity, the ﬂ-effect and change in the Cor-
iolis parameter on wave amplitude for small periods (of the order of several
hours) is manifested for the most part in-the resonance region and leads to both
a change in the resonance amplitude of the wave and to a shift in the resonance
frequency.

[Article by V. F. Ivanov]

[Text] Abstract: With allowance for surface and bot-
tom friction layers a study was made of the
generation of long waves in the ocean propa—
gating over a bottom rise through the action
of atmospheric waves. It was established that
in the surface layer the drift wave velocity
component makes a substantial contribution to
total wave velocity, especially for shorter
wave lengths. It is noted that the influence
of viscosity, the [B-effect and bottom relief
on the elements of the generated waves is re-
flected more significantly in the region close
to resonance and in the neighborhood of the
peak of the underwater rise.

Recently interest has increased in study of the variability of oceanological fields
caused by periodic oscillations in the atmosphere having characteristic periods
from several days to months [1]. Nevertheless, it is of interest to investigate

wave movements in the ocean in the range from several hours to a day, emphasizing
the upper surface layer in which intensive wave movements can exist. In many stud-

ies [2. 3] in which a study has been made of the influence of viscosity on the gen-

eration of surface and internal waves by atmospheric disturbances in most cases the
investigation was confined to the bottom boundary layer and the depth of the ocean
was assumed to be constant. An investigation of wave movements at the bottom with

allowance for viscosity in a basin of variable depth was made in [5].

In this article. by numerical methods. with allowance for the surface and bottom
friction layers, a study is nade of the generation of long waves by periodic atmo-
spheric pressures in a homogeneous ocean of variable depth.

Assume that a plane wave of atmospheric pressure

depth it generates a wave in the form

which propagates over a local bottom rise having a domelike configuration [5]. The

underwater rise; H0 is maximum ocean depth; H is the elevation of the bottom rise.

We will investigate deformation of waves in t e ocean generated by atmospheric
waves over the underwater rise and we will study the structure of wave velocities.

The equation for the complex amplitude of a wave with allowance for viscosity, the
ﬁ-effect, bottom relief, wave shearing and normal stresses at the surface, ex-

pressed through atmospzheric pressure gradients, is written in the form

lent viscosity of air and sea water. In accordance with [lo] we will assume that

they are equal to V' - 10" cm2/sec, V- 102 cmzlsec. In [6]. within the framework
of the linear theory of long waves, for 031 the equation (lo) was derived in which
we will neglect the secondary effects of the variability of t and H, associated
with viscosity, since their role is small for the deep ocean when the depth R>h,
where h is the thickness of the boundary layer (h . 5.d1'1).

Figure la,b,c shows the dependence of the maximum amplitudes of the wave A and sur-
face wave velocities U and V on A for T - 2 and ﬁ- 0, computed for variable (curves
1 and 1') and constant (curves 2 and 2') bottom relief (here and in the text which
follows U and V are indicated in centimeters per second,_A in centimeters, )lin
kilometers, Y'and V' in square centimeters per second, T is in hours. Curves l and
2 were obtained taking into account all the terms in (b) and (5) and 1' and 2' for
V' = 0. In Fig. 1,a the curves 1' and 2' have been omitted because they are close
to l and 2. This small difference is attributable to the fact that allowance for
tangential friction at the surface (9' ab 0) has little effect on wave amplitude
(by only several percent), but exerts a more significant influence on wave move-
ments in the surface layer (Fig. l,b,c). In this case the greatest differences in
the amplitudes of U", Vb from U r' Var, computed for the cases V' a 104 and V' - 0
respectively. are observed on the slopes and at the base of the resonance curves.
It should be noted that for 2>l (l is the resonance wave length) the amplitudes
of velocities {In} Ugrv Vn> V8!" whereas for 625<)<) , on the other hand, un<ugv
Vnt<Vgr. The influence of bottom relief on wave amplitude is more significant near
resonance and on the amplitudes U and V in the entire resonance region (33 3(12).

Now we will examine a case when 3.: 3 . An analysis of the results of computations
shows that during resonance the influegce of tangential friction with z - 0 ex-
erts little effect both on the wave.amplitude and on the amplitude of velocities.
For example, for the period T - l with V' - 104 the amplitudes AP. Up and V are
approximately 1.72 greater than the corresponding amplitudes with u' = 0, w ereas
for T = 2 - by 2.51. At the same time, the influence of bottom relief on wave ele-
ments is manifested more strongly and increases with approach to resonance. For the
amplitudes of velocities this increase is considerably greater than for the wave
amplitude. For example, for T - l with y' - 104 AP is 15.22 greater for variable
bottom relief than for constant bottom relief, Up is greater by a factor of 2.3
and Vp by a factor of 16.2. For T - 2 this increase is: AP by 4.1%, Up and VP by
factors of 1.7 and 5.5 respectively, that is, with an increase in the period the
role of bottom relief decreases.

Returning to Fig. l,b,c we see that with a decrease in wave length its amplitude far
from resonance decreases, whereas the velocities Un and Vn increase. This increase

is attributable to an increase in the role of the components of drift wave velocit-
ies ”dr and Vdr'

Table 1 gives the values Udr and Vdr (upper and lower lines respectively), computed
with the use of formulas (5), (6) for six periods and different wave lengths. It
follows from this table that with an increase in the period of oscillations and a
decrease in wavelength 03: and V8r increase by several times and allowance for them

is important in the surface layer, especially for shorter wave lengths.

Figure 2 shows the fields of amplitudes of surface velocities U and V, computed us~
ing formulas (5) for T I 2 and two wave lengths } - 825 and ﬂ - 800. The solid
curves correspond to the total veiocities Un and V“, whereas the dashed curves cor~
respond to the gradient velocities Us, and Vgr' computed without allowance for the
terms udr and Vd . An analysis of the Un and Us: fields shows that at the center of
the underwater rise there is one large disturbance on both sides of which there are
two additional lobes. Qualitatively the Un and "gr fields for',1- 800 agree well

with one another although there is a small quantitative difference. The maximum
amplitudes Un - 0.91, US! - 1.00. For A - 625 the'IJn and Ugr fields have only an
external similarity. A more detailed analysis indicates that the U“ field at the

center has a minimum (Un - 0.3) and Us: has a maximum (0 r I 0.82). Within the
additional lobes U“ is greater and Us, is less than outa de them.

The Vn and V r fields behave otherwise. Both qualitatively and quantitatively they
differ greatly from one another. For example, the Vn field for 2- 625 to the left
of the direction of movement or the wave (y > 0) is more intense and has two maxim.

To the right of the x-axis (y<0) it is weaker and consists of two lobes, each of
which has its own maximal. The isolines of the V8, field, on the other hand, are
clustered to a greater degree to the right of the rude, but at the left there are
two lobes with a maximum and a separate lobe along the y-axis (Y>0) with a minimum.
For A- 800 the Vn and V8, fields agree better qualitatively than for 3' 625. They

have a great quantitative difference. For example, the V“ field is more intense
than \I8r (Fig. 2).

The presence of a ﬂ-effect is reflected for the most part in the resonance region
675‘ “(750 (1.05970'7 0.953, where 5- 21,;4, A - 714.76). It can be seen (Table
2) that for 1- 675 and 3>750 the influence of he ﬂ-effect and bottom relief on
the amplitudes of waves and velocities is small and does not exceed 2-32 (the upper
lines correspond to the values of the maximum amplitudes A, U, V, computed without
taking the ﬁ-effect into account and the lower lines —- with the [B-effect taken
into account). With approach to resonance their role increases. For example, for

3 - 705 and 1- 725 the maximum amplitudes A, U and V change by 8-101 in compar-
ison with a case when the ﬁ-effect is absent.

If ﬂ- 0, the amplitudes of the waves virtually do not change for waves propagat-
ing in forward (9 - 0°) and backward (6' 180‘) directions, but the amplitudes
of velocities change by only 2-32 for 1- 705 and A- 725. For these same wave
lengths, but with allowance for the ﬁ-effect, this difference is more signif-
icant and for both the wave amplitude and for velocities is approximately 15-17:.
In addition, if )9 - O and 2’3 , the amplitudes A, U and V0 are less for 6- 0'
and greater for 9- 180° than Rn the presence of a ,B-effect. In the case )>2p
the opposite picture is observed. '

With resonance (1- AP) the role of the ﬂ-effect is manifested in a decrease in
the maximum amplitudes of the wave elements. For example, the amplitude of the
wave is 321 less and the amplitudes of velocities are approximately 282 less than

in the absence of the lB-effect. It must be noted that in a resonance case even
withlﬂ 1h 0 the maximum amplitudes of velocities and waves virtually do not change
for 59- 0 and d?- 180°. The joint influence of the )3-effect and bottom relief in-
creases not only with approach to resonance, but also with approach to the peak

of the underwater rise. Nevertheless, qualitatively the fields of amplitudes A},
U0 and V5 do not experience significant changes. In this case the V field is more
intense to the right of the direction of movement of the wave both during its prop-
agation in a straight line and in the opposite direction. In a study of the role of
the p-effect we assumed V' - O in order to evaluate better its influence on the
amplitudes of gradient wave velocities.

Figure 3 shows profiles of the velocities u and v, computed for the period T - 2
hours at the time t - 0 (solid curves) and after a quarter-period t - 0.25T (dashed
curves) for a point situated at the center of the bottom rise (x - 0, y - 0). Curves
l and 2 correspond to A- 200, curves 1' and 2‘ correspond to A- 400. The analysis
indicates that as time passes the profiles of the velocities u and v experience con-
siderable changes both in value and direction. For example, the Velocity u for )K-
200 has a clearly expressed maximum at a depth of 6.5 m at the time t - 0.25T, and
for 3 - 400 - with t - O. The v profiles behave similarly, but in contrasc to u
the v velocities have a rather distinct maximum for‘A- 200 and t - 0 (curve 1), and
also for A I 400 and t - 0.25T (curve 2').

Summary

Allowance for surface shearing stresses has little effect on wave amplitude for
short periods (of about several hours) in comparison with the normal stresses, but
is more important in computing the velocity of the wave current,especially in the
surface layer for shorter wave lengths.

The influence of bottom relief, and also the joint influence of the )9-effect and
bottom relief is manifested to the greatest degree near resonance and near the peak
of the underwater rise.

Abstract: In this article the wave resistance

of a viscous fluid is represented by the L. N.
Sretenskiy integral. An asymptotic solution is
obtained in the case of an arbitrary viscosity.
Known solutions are obtained in the case of van-
ishing viscosity. Numerical computations indi-
cate the presence of such regions of parameters
in which even a small viscosity gives results
differing substantially from the results for

an ideal fluid in these same regions of the val-
ues of the parameters.

In a linear formulation we solve the problem of computing the wave resistance R
of a viscous fluid covered by a viscous film with the steady movement of normal
pressures pa, uniformly distributed in a segment [1, 2], over the surface of the

fluid

The computations were nade for different Fr and HE numbers. It follows from the
computations that the influence of viscosity in essence is expressed only for
velocities of movement greater than 20 m/sec. The presence of a region of a
sharp rise and fall of the wave resistance of a viscous fluid is of interest,
whereas for an ideal fluid a tendency of wave resistance to a limiting constant

value is characteristic. The influence of a surface film is important only in
the rise region.

For velocity values less than 20 m/sec the computed values of wave resistance for
all four expressions coincide with a great accuracy.

L. N. Sretenskiy [1] derived his formulas by the method of expanding the integrand

of wave resistance into a series in powers of viscosity near vanishing viscosity.

The correction for viscosity obtained by this method was insignificant. In this
study we have investigated this same L. N. Sretenskiy integral, but have obtained

a different asymptotic expansion of this integral for arbitrary viscosity, from
which the L. N. Sretenskiy solution is obtained as a special case.

The curves presented in this study show that it is possible to indicate the zones
of values of the parameters for which the influence of viscosity is important.

A clarification of the influence of different factors on wave resistance is neces-
sary in developing means for lessening it.

[Text] Abstract: In a linear formulation the authors
examine the process of development of spatial
long waves in a two-layer fluid caused by ini-
tial displacements of the free surface and inter-
faces of the layers. A study was made of the influ-
ence of asymmetry of the initial disturbance on the
developing unsteady surface and internal waves. The
rises are modeled by a set of a finite number of
identical (but displaced relative to one another)
axisymmetric displacements of a special type. for
which the solution of the problem is expressed
through elementary functions. It is shown that for
extended initial disturbances waves radiated perpen-
dicularly to the greatest axis of the rise are dom-
inant. A comparison with both plane and axisynr
metric waves is presented. Regions for which the
spatial waves are close to plane waves are deter-
mined.

The process of evolution of nonaxisymmetric initial displacements of the free sur-
face and the interfaces of layers of a two-layer fluid is examined. The influence
of the asymmetry of the initial disturbance on the developing surface waves was in-
vestigated earlier in [1, S, 6].

1. A basin of the constant depth H, filled with an ideal incompresnible two-layer
fluid, unbounded in horizontal directions, is examined. The thickness and density
of the upper layer are hi and [>1 respectively; for the lower layer, hz andlﬂ>z,
the corresponding parameters are [31902, H - hl + hz. At the time t - 0 the free
surface and interface are displaced from the horizontal positions and the velocity
field is absent. within the framework of the linear theory of long waves we will
investigate the influence of asymmetry of the mentioned initial disturbances on
the process of formation and propagation of surface and internal waves.

The solution of the axisynnetric problen makes it possible to study some features
of development of spatial waves in more complex cases when the initial displace-
ments of the free surface and interface of fluid layers do not have cylindrical

syuetry. He will use, as in [l], where the case of a homogeneous fluid was ex-
amined, the very simple method for modeling of such wave processes. It rests on
the algebraic addition of a finite umber of identical initial axisymmetric dis-
placements of the form (1.5), whose centers are situated at different points (x13.

with t - O the maximum values of displacements of the surface and interface of the
fluid layers are equal to R1 and R2 respectively.

The simplest case is that examined below when the points (x11, yij) lie on a
straight line at an identical distanceAJq from one another. UithOut limitations
on universality it can he assumed that this line coincides with the Ox-axis; the
point (x10, Via) is at the origin of coordinates. Then in formulas (1.7), (1.8)
x13 ' 14 L1, y“ - 0 (i . 1,2; :1 . 0, 111%) the displacements 21(x,y,t) are even
functions of x and y. This makes it poss ble to limit ourselves to an analysis of
waves only in the region x; 0, y) 0.

The asymetry of the initial rise of the indicated type is conveniently evaluated

by the parameter V1, equal to the ratio of the characteristic length 2L11 of the
rise to its characteristic width 2L21( J1 - L11L‘1). If as the conditional boun-
dary of the initial rise we take the isoline on ahich 2.1’(x,y) - 0.1A1, then as
L11 it is desirable to take the maximum distance from it to the origin of coordin-
ates, and as L21 it is desirable to take the minimum distance from it to the ori-
gin of coordinates.

A further analysis of waves was made using the formulas (1.3), (1.6). The values
h1, hz, B were taken equal to 0.8, 6.2 km, 10’3 respectively, as is characteris-
tic for the ocean floor. It was also assumed that [,1 - L 2 - 52.6 km, AL - ALZ
- 30 km. In all the figures presented below the distance is measured in 1:1 ometers.

2. Assume that A1 ' 1, A2 - O. In this case at the time t - 0 the free surface of
the fluid deviates from the position of equilibrium; the interface of the layers
is horizontal.

and 721 coincides with the precise expression for the rise of the free surface of
a homogeneous fluid.

It follows from formulas (2.1), (2.2) and the results of [6] that the initial axi-
symmetric displacement of the fluid surface leads to the formation of surface and
internal waves attenuating with time. The first terms in formulas (2.1) corres-

pond to a surface wave; the second terms correspond to an internal wave. A surface
wave is slightly distorted due to inhomogeneity of the fluid and in the process

of its propagation causes a displacement of the interface of layers of the same
sign which is less by a factor of Hhél. The velocity of propagation 721 is evi-

dently close to c. The anplitude of he developing purely internal wave is maximum
at the interface of the layers; at the free surface it is “(ahzrl times less

and the velocity of its propagation is u2<< c. Due to the linearity of the ini-
tial mathematical problem the mentioned general properties of unsteady waves in
a two-layer fluid are correct for nonaxisynmetric initial displacements of the

type (1.7).

velopment (A1 - 1, A2 - 0): a) isolines 102 21; b) isolines 102 :2.

The process of development of unsteady surface and internal waves in the case of
an initial displacement of the free surface of the fluid with n1 - 7 (L11 - 295
km, L21 - 145 km, V1-2.04 is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.

Thus, the initial displacement of the free surface of the fluid in the process of
its evolution leads to the formation of a spatial surface wave 11 attenuating with

is situated at the origin of coordinates (Pig. l,b). In addition to a local depres—
sion of the density jump. an internal rise wave is formed which corresponds to the
main surface wave and moves with the velocity of long waves in a homogeneous flu-
id. It is the "response" of a surface wave, as was mentioned at the beginning of
this section. Its amplitude, as mentioned earlier, is Ehal times less than the am‘
plitude of the surface wave.

In accordance with Fig. l,b, in the neighborhood of the origin of coordinates in
the initial stage of movement of the fluid a region of negative (2 values is form-
ed, elongated along the Om-axis. In the process of its evolution, when the main
disturbances of the free surface become small. purely internal waves are formed
(Pig. 2,a); the velocity of their propagation is u2<3:c. It follows from a com-
parison of Figures 1,a and 2.a that the spatial structure of the surface and in-
ternal waves qualitatively has much in common if ‘32 is considered, rather than

22'

In the process of propagation of this internal wave it exerts a reverse effect on
the free surface of the fluid. The developing surface waves (Pig. 2,b) constitute
a "response" of the internal wave at the free surface of the fluid. Their ampli-
tude is less by a factor greater than 103 than the maximum vertical displacements
within the fluid. The spatial structure of 31 and 22 with t>'lS hours is different;
especially the positive 21 values are localized in an annular region. which was
not observed for internal waves.

At one and the same moment in time t the amplitude of a purely internal wave is
slightly dependent on the relative density drop 8', but the velocity of its prop-
agation and the amplitude of the surface waves caused by it decrease substantially
with a decrease in 5 .

Thus, the initial displacement of the free surface of a two-layer fluid in the
course of its development can generate internal waves whose amplitude is of the
same order of magnitude as the amplitude of the initial disturbance. Such waves
attenuate considerably more slowly than surface waves and are dominant after de-
parture of the main surface waves from the region of the initial displacement of
the free surface of the fluid. In all cases for initial displacements of the
fluid surface elongated along the Ox-axis the waves of greatest amplitude are
radiated in the direction of the Oy-axis. Such a directivity of radiation of un-
steady waves is observed even with Vi values extremely close to l.

It follows from formulas (3.1), (3.2), (1.7) and the results in [4] that the ini-
tial axisylmsetric density jump leads to the formation of surface and internal
waves. The first terms in formulae (3.1) correspond to a surface wave; the second

terms correspond to an internal wave. The amplitude of the surface wave is of the

order of 0(a) and therefore is substantially less than the awlitude of the in-
ternal wave. It is evident thatgzzﬁz.

The process of development of unsteady surface and internal waves in the case of
initial displacement of the interface of layers in the form (1.5), (1.7) with n2

- 7 (L12 - 295 km. L22 - 145 km, 1’2 - 2.010) is illustrated in Figures 3, lo.

The initial displacement of the interface of layers of the fluid (Fig. 3,a) in
the process of its development generates surface waves of two types: first, pure-
ly surface waves propagating with the velocity c (Fig. 3), second, disturbances
of the free surface, caused by inhomogeneity of the fluid (Pig. 6,b), propagating
with the velocity of internal waves u2. The formation of surface waves of the
first type caused a slow subsidence of the central part of the initial displace-
ment of the density jump. These waves constitute two regions of positive 21 val-
ues propagating in opposite directions and having maximum amplitude values on the
Oy-axis (Fig. 3). Thereafter the deformations of the initial riseZ‘z’ and the free
surface increase at the origin of coordinates, which lead to the formation of
slowly evolving internal waves (Fig. 4,a), which correspond to qualitatively sim-
ilar surface deformations of the fluid of opposite sign, representing the above-
mentioned second class of surface waves of small amplitude (Pig. 6,b). All the
considered waves are essentially three-dimensional. For initial displacements of
the interface of layers elongated along the Ox-axis the waves of greatest ampli-
tude are radiated in the direction of the Oy-axis.

It is clear from a comparison of Figures l,a. 2,a, 3,a and lo,a that the spatial
structure of the fields of purely internal and purely surface waves has much in
common, although these classes of waves have essentially different propagation

velocities. This conclusion can also be drawn from formulas (2.1), (2.2), (3.1),
(3.2). In accordance with (1.7), the spatial structure of the mentioned surface
waves is described by the sum of the integrals 2.1 or 61. for internal wav --

initial parameters of the problem and this dependence is particularly important
in the case of large t values. A change in h. hz and 15 . leading to an increase

[Text] Abstract: A solution of the plane problem
of gravitational waves arising at the hori-
zontal discontinuity of two flows of fluid of
different density is obtained and investigated.

We will examine two flows of an ideal fluid situated one beneath the other and ex-
tending without linit in a vertical direction. Assume that the lower flow has the
velocity c1 and the density [3 ; the upper flow has the velocity and density c2

and P2 and p >f . At the i tial moment in time t - 0 the fluid particles are
imparted any add tional velocity and the initially horizontal discontinuity changes
somewhat. It is necessary to find the form of the discontinuity at any moment in

time t>0.

He will cite the equations and boundary conditions of the problem of internal
waves. We will use the horizontal line of separation of flows in an undisturbed

state as the x—axia, whereas the y-axis is directed vertically upward. We will as-
sume that the xy coordinate system moves in the plane of motion in a horizontal

direction with the constant velocity

Here g is the acceleration of gravity; )7(x;t) is the deviation of the discontinuity
from the position of equilibrium; 71(x,y;t) and ¢ (x,y;t) are the potentials of the
velocity of wave movement of the lower and upper f uida; the derivatives of the
functions 5‘1 and (P2 are taken with y - 0.

The problem of internal waves is usually formulated in the following way. It is nec-
essary to find such a solution (P1 of the Laplace equation in the lower half-plane,
becoming equal to zero together with the first-order partial derivatives with y -

- 0°, and such a solution 9’2 of this same equation in the upper half-plane, having
a similar behavior with y - 00, which on the axis y - 0 would satisfy the two boun-
dary conditions obtained from (2)-(lo) by exclusion of the function I7 , and also
some initial conditions. With known velocity potentials the discontinuity equation
is found using formula (2) by simple differentiation.

2. An analysis of the equations and the boundary conditions makes it possible to
simplify the problem somewhat.

First, the right-hand sides of the kinematic conditions (3) and (4) are the normal
derivatives of the velocity potentials on the x-axis. Accordingly, regarding 9’1
and V-Pz as solutions of the Nemann problem for the lower and upper half-planes,
it is possible to represent them in the form of the corresponding potentials of a

simple layer and to check to see that the dependence

exists between them on the x-axis. Using this additional expression, following
from the continuity of motion, the boundary conditions for the velocity potentials

are transformed to a form similar to the Cauchy-Poisson condition at the free sur-
face, -

Second, in this problem the initial values of the functions ‘Pl. 9; and '1 have a
physical sense. However, the difference in the kinematic conditions (3)-(l.) shows
that at the initial moment a zero velocity should correspond to a zero displace-

ment of the discontinuity, and on the contrary, a zero displacement corresponds to
equal velocities of the particles. This means that it is possible to stipulate only
two functions arbitrarily, for example,

boundary particles of fluid flows. Using conditions (6), it is possible to find

The group velocity of the internal waves, like the waves at the surface of a deep '

Thus, in a coordinate system moving in the plane of movement in a horizontal direc-
tion with the mean mass velocity of the floes (1) and related to the x, y axes,
series of waves of the length «Jr! are propagated from the origin of coordinates

in both directions; these waves move to infinity, being distended in length and
accelerating. As time passes the distension and the acceleration of the waves at-
tenuates greatly, as a result of which a considerable part of the discontinuity is
covered with waves whose length, period and phase velocity are given approxilstely
by formulas (11). (13) and (14); their numerical values are cited in the table.

[Text] Abstract: The effect of vertical density
structure on the kinematic characteristics
of free internal gravitational waves is in-
vestigated. The investigations are made both
for averaged density distributions and for
models with a vertical fine structure.

At the present time a considerable percentage of the investigations devoted to the
fine vertical structure of the ocean are directed to a study of the role played

by internal waves during its formation [1, 2, 8]. Closely akin to these investiga-
tions are the problems related to the influence of fine structure itself on the
field of internal waves [3, a, 9]. Due to the experimental studies carried out in
these directions it was possible to obtain a considerable number of different esti-
mates of the size of microscale inhomogeneities having the nature of stratification.
Such estimates, in turn, made it possible to choose the models most completely tak-
ing into account the real density distribution in the ocean [3] and making it pos-
sible to analyze the distorting effect of fine structure on internal waves Ia, 9].

In this article, in contrast to [3, 4, 9], we study the dependence of the elements
of internal waves on fine structure parameters. In comparison with [3, 4], we give
a more detailed analysis of the influence of characteristic vertical scales of the
"fine stratification" ("sheets" with a thickness from 10 cm to 3 m were taken into
account) and high local values of the VﬁisilE-Brunt frequency on the kinematic char-
acteristics of internal waves.

we will examine a plane layer of an ideal inhomogeneous incompressible fluid of a

significant in the region of quite long waves 1< k‘ 5. For example, with k - 3

the period of oscillations of the third internal node of the P5 model will then
be 1 1/2 times less than the period of this same mode in the case of an averaged

stratification. with K k<5 the dispersion dependences are close to linear.

In the region 10-5 the behavior of the dispersion curves becomes more complex. Here
in models with a fine structure P5, P9 resonance zones are formed [5] and anomal-
ies appear in the neighborhood of the so-called critical frequencies at which some
characteristic value of one waveguide coincides with some value of the other [3].
For model P9. which contains the greatest number of "sheets" and in these inter-
layers having the maximum (in comparison with P5) local values of the vhisﬁlé-Brunt
frequency. the anomalous effect is expressed more strongly than for P5. This is
evidently attributable to the fact that with an increase in the local values of the
VSisKlS-Brunt frequency N1 the region of characteristic frequencies of individual
waveguides (A hi) expands accordingly (6011) and the probability of coincidence

of the characteristic values of the different "sheets" increases. The greater the
number of poorly interrelated waveguides (that is, the number of "sheets"). evident-
ly. the more probable will be the cases of coincidence of their characteristic fre-
quencies. we will mention the ranges of critical frequencies for the fifth, fourth
and third modes of internal waves of the model P9. with 0.4<kg10 we obtain

138

POROFFICIALUSEONLY
alues of group velocities for the first
five modes of internal waves of the models f39 and /00 (V9/Vo). The strongest in-
fluence of the fine structure on group velocities is observed (beginning with the
third modeg in the region S$'k:§7 in which all the ranges of critical frequencies
0.25<6~10 (0.45 (Fig. 2) fall. In this region the group velocities for the aver-
aged model greatly exceed the ”fine stratification" values. with 7<:k;;10 the

group velocity V increases sharply and becomes greater in value than V0, but this
difference is algeady less significant than in the region 5‘ k( 7.

Thus, an increase in the number n of "sheets" with high local values of the $151,331;-
Brunt frequency in the structure of the thermocline (with retention of the relation-
ships (1) and a weak correlation between the waveguides) leads for the most part to
the clearest manifestation of anomalies in the dispersion curves, which exerts a
substantial effect on the group velocity of the internal waves. However in quantita-
tive estimates the decisive role is played by the parameter In -- the total number
of layers. For example, the anomalous effect for the £35 distribution is expressed
more weakly than for ’09. Nevertheless, the discrepancy in the dispersion curves

139

FOR OFFICIAL (BE ONLY

for models ,0 and P is far more significant than in the case P9 and P0 (P13.
2). That is, espite ghe fact that with an increase in a there can be rather strong
anomalous effects in the dispersion relationships, the discrepancy between the dis-
persion curves of models P0 and P" as might be expected, decreases with an in-
crease in m.

Table 2

 

Although the relative changes introduced by the fine structure in the region of
short waves increase (for example, the frequency of oscillations for one and the
same wavelength can decrease by several times), this is not reflected very apprec-
iably, evidently, in the amplitudes of the internal waves. It was demonstrated in
[9] that for the region l/2<6’ 2/N026 3/4 the relative changes in amplitudes con-
stitute less than 102. From this point of view, the sector 6 2INOZ< 1/2 (Fig. 2) is
of definite interest because for it there are already rather considerable discrep-
ancies in the periods of oscillations of internal waves having a quite great length.

Figure 3 shows the depth distributions of the amplitudes of the third and fifth
modes of the vertical and horizontal components of the velocity vector of wave
disturbance, computed for the models Pg (2- O, S, 9, 22) with k - 10 and related
to their maximum values. It can be seen that the presence of elements of fine
structure leads to a displacement of the nodal and extremal points in the thermo-
cline, which in depth fall for the most part in the interlayers Ahi. Such a dis-
tribution of extrema for the high modes causes a concentration of movement in rath-
er narrow "sheets" (Pig. 3,b). However, this effect occurs only for the P5 model.
In comparing the fine vertical structure in the models P5, P9, P2 . we note that
the "sheets" (A hi) alternate successively with laminae (Aﬂj). In the ,05 model
the ratios AH [4111 will be maximum. Thus, one of the necessary conditions for

the concentration of the higher modes in layers with high local values of the
VKisglg-Brunt frequency is the existence of a weak correlation between the "sheets"
in the vertical density structure. A numerical analysis indicated that the velocity
profiles, computed from models with a fine structure, are more sensitive (especial-
ly the horizontal component, Pig. 3) to changes in the wave number than the profile
with an averaged stratification. For example, the amplitude of the fifth node of
the vertical velocity component for the P9 model at emergence from the thermocline
with k - 10 attains its maximum value; with k - 3 this value will already be 221
of the maximum. The amplitude values “(2) for the third mode of the P 5 model

(with k . 3) and the fifth mdel of the P22 mdel (with k - 10) at the entry into
the thermocline and upon emergence from it constitute 50: of the maximum, whereas
for the averaged stratification (P0 model) these values, all other conditions be-
ing equal, will be maximum. Such a redistribution of extrema and frequencies, in-
troduced by the fine structure (Figures 2, 3), can exert a substantial influence
on the kinematic characteristics of internal waves beyond the limits of the ther-
mocline. For example, for the third mode of the F5 model the

140

Value of the vertical velocity component with x - 0, k - 3 at the depth HIZ at the
times t - 5007f, 10001 will constitute 0.23, 0.18 of the maxim (unity) respec-
tively; in the case of an averaged density, all other conditions being equal, -0.1,
4.46. Thus, the distorting effect of fine structure will lead to a change in the
intensity and direction of velocity beyond the limits of the thermocline.

Now we will clarify how the dimensions of the "sheets" Ahi exert an influence on
the elemnts of internal waves. He will take an averaged stratifica ion ,00(z) with
the parameters a - 4-103 m. u, - 80 m, 32 - 120 II, AP- 0.0006 g/cm . no - 0.01:.
He. He will model the fine structure by the P5 distribution containing three
identical waveguides (Ah, - 2 m, 491 - 0.0002 glcm3), two of which are situated
on the’Jaoundaries of the thermocline and one in the middle. The density distribu-
tion P5(z) is obtained from the P5 model by decreasing Ahi ( i - l, 2, 3) by a
factor of lo and retaining the former All, APvalues. Computations indicated that
the vertical structure of the modes of internal waves of the model P almost do
not differ from the vertical structure of the corresponding modes of t e P5 model
with one and the same k values. However, there can be a strong discrepancy in the
periods of oscillations of these modes of identical structure. Po example, with k
- 10 the periods of oscillations of the fourth mode of the P5, 5 models are re-
lated as 1:2 res ectively, although with respect to vertical structure the modes
of the P5 and 5 models virtually coincide.

[Text] Abstract: A study was made of the influence of
vertical density structure on the kinematic
characteristics of internal waves generated by
surface disturbances, periodic in time, occurr-
ing in a limited region. The investigation is
carried out both for an averaged stratification
and for a distribution with a vertical fine struc-

ture.

An investigation of the influence of vertical density structure on the elements
of free internal gravitational waves was carried out in [1-5].

In this article we examine the distorting effect of fine stratification on the kin-
ematic characteristics of internal waves generated by surface disturbances, per-
iodic in time, occurring in a linited region.

1. Assume that pressures in the form

are applied to the free surface of an inhomogeneous ideal incompressible fluid of
finite depth, where f is an even continuous function equal to zero with Ix L>B. He
'have investigated the kinematic characteristics of internal waves arising under
the influence of the applied pressure system, with averaged stratification f>o(z)
and in the case of a distribution with a fine structure )Dn(z). Comparing the re-

sults of these investigations we will evaluate the distorting influence of fine
structure on internal waves.

We will select the origin of coordinates at the undisturbed free surface. The :-
axis is directed vertically upward. He will relate the dimensionless variables and

tions for T< T3 as a result of the dispersion of the numerical method.

It can be seen (Fig. 2) that fine structure exerts a substantial influence on the
depth distribution of the naxinum values of amplitudes of the vertical velocity

we note that the difference in the amplitudes V70, W7 exists not only in the thermo-
cline region (-62.5; zs-ZO), but also beyond its limits.~For example during the
period 1'2 in the upper homogeneous layer with -20$ ?<-5 H exceeds 7 by more than
a factor of 2. The same picture is observed during the pergod T1 in the region -20<
ZS'IS.

For the period T3 the greatest difference in the values 9'0, 377 is observed in the
entire lower homogeneous layer where the amplitude W7 exceeds by a factor greater
than 2 the corresponding Ho value.~The computations indicated that such a strong
discrepancy in the amplitudes W0, w, during the period T3 is attributable primarily
to substantial differences in the modal composition of the internal waves for the

models Po, P 7.

Figure 3 shows the functions H {1, VQ1 (V 1-1 are the harmonics of horizontal velo-
city, 1 - 0, l, 2,...), cowuted at the time t - 310, when Vzl during the period

of averaged stratification there is obviously a dominance of the harmonics H L0,

VI in the entire depth, that is. surface waves. In the case of a fine stratif-
icagion with the formation of the velocity profile sz the most important role
is played by internal waves (in particular, the first internal node). A similar
manifestation of the fine structure is also observed during formation of the
horizontal velocity profile. The structure of the internal modes V71, in contrast
to V01, has a clearly expressed power-law character (Pig. 3.b).

Table 2 gives the maximum (in absolute value) values of the parameters and V3},

Since the profile of horizontal velocity in mogeneous layers f run straight

4. We will estimate the amplitudes of the kinematic characteristics of internal
waves at the ocean surface. The fine stratification of the thermocline exerts vir-
tually no influence on the amplitude of the vertical velocity component of the
wave disturbance at the free surface (Fig. 2). The distorting effect of fine
structure on the horizontal component is more_significant. For the periods T1 and
T the discrepancies in the amplitudes 9' , Vx7 at the free surface are 10 and
122 respectively (on - 1002). With T - T3 this value will already be equal to
gpz. Computations have shown that such a strong discrepancy in the amplitudes of
on, V;; for the period T2 is attributable to the distorting effect which the
fine structure exerts on the modal composition of the internal waves (the fine
stratification exerts virtually no influence on the surface mode, that is, V00

(opt) - V70(0,t)).
Conclusions

Fine stratification exerts a significant influence on the depth distribution of
the kinematic characteristics of the wave disturbance; depending on the period of
oscillations it can both increase and decrease them.

As a result of the distorting influence of fine structure on the modal composition
of internal waves the profiles of horizontal and vertical velocities in the ther-
mocline region can experience structural changes of considerable amplitude (the
values of the vertical velocity component can more than triple).

The distorting effect of fine structure exists not only in the thermocline region.

but also beyond its limits; in the upper homogeneous layer it exerts the strongest
influence on the horizontal velocity component, whereas in the lower homogeneous

layer it exerts the strongest influence on the vertical velocity component.
The presence of a fine stratification of the thermocline can lead to an appreciable
increase (by a factor of 2) in the amplitudes of the horizontal velocity of the

wave disturbance at the ocean surface, but this leaves the vertical velocity value
unchanged.

[Article by N. P. Bulgak0v and R. A. Yaroshenys]

[Text] Abstract: On the basis of hydrological
data with the use of a frontal zone mod-
el the authors give an evaluation of the
possible values of elements of the field
of internal waves for the south polar
front.

Data from in situ observations [19, 20] indicate that frontal zones are regions
of increased intensity of internal waves in the ocean. This explains the inter-
est in a model study of these zones as one of the important factors in the gener-
ation of internal waves.

In sources [2, 17, 18, 26, 27] the frontal zone is modeled by a jet of constant
width. Beyond the limits of the jet the fluid is assumed to be motionless. The
effect of Coriolis force and the slope of the free surface and the discontinuity
is taken into account.

Within the framework of a three-layer model of the ocean [a] a study was made of
a thermal frontal zone constituting a rising or subsidence of cold waters, which

is attributable to the curvature of a density discontinuity.

A frontal zone in the form of a region with a constant horizontal density gradient
in a two-layer ocean was examined in [2, 3, 5]. The velocities of flow, related to
a horizontal density gradient, are assumed to be of the same order of magnitude
with the velocities of wave disturbances. we note that in the enumerated studies
the indicated models of a front were used for studying the general laws of genera-
tion of internal waves outside and inside frontal zones of different types, but
were not used in precomputing the parameters of internal waves in any specific
frontal zone in the ocean.

In this article an attempt is made to obtain an evaluation of the possible values
of the parameters of long-period internal waves for the south polar front (SPF).
The analysis is made on the basis of hydrological data with use of an earlier de-
veloped model of a frontal zone described in detail in [2. 3].

The principal objective was, assuming the amplitude and frequency of an oncoming
barotropic wave to be known, to detect the dependence of elements of the gener-
ated internal waves on the parameters of the SPFZ (south polar front zone) (width
of zone, depth and latitude, thickness of layers, horizontal and vertical density

dr0ps). The choice of this zone is attributable to the relatively good study of
this feature.

In solving the formulated problem it is important to know the spatial-temporal var-
iability of the position of the frontal zone and its genetic characteristics. How-
ever, among the investigators of the 8912 there is no unanimous opinion concerning
these matters. The authors of [6] analyzed different points of view concerning the
spatial-temporal variability of the SPPZ; an attempt was made to evaluate its posi-
tion and clarify its genetic characteristics.

In 1937 Deacon [21] was the first to determine the position of the SPPZ as relative-
ly stable (the distance between extremal positions did not exceed 60 miles); he de-
fined the frontal zone as the boundary region between subantarctic and antarctic
surface waters. 0n the basis of the temperature distribution in the water layer he
advanced the hypothesis that the position of the 8992 is governed by bottom topo-
graphy, by the movmnt of deep and bottom waters. In 1966 Mackintosh (24] fixed

the changes in the position of the zone to be 26-29 miles.

V. N. Botnikov [6], on the basis of data from the Soviet Antarctic Expedition of
1955-1958, and also the materials of the "Discovery" expedition, examined the ver-
ticsl distribution of temperature and established that the 2° isotherm at the hori—
zon 100-300 m characterizes the northern boundary of the SPFZ and that the devia-
tion of the position of the SPPZ from the mean does not exceed 60 miles. Yu. A.
Ivanov [11] assigns a decisive role in the formation of the fronts to the nonuni-
formity of the wind field; he defines dynamic frontal zones (zones with extremal
vertical velocities —- divergence and convergence) and accompanying physical front-
a1 zones in which there are clearly expressed physicochemical characteristics.
Theoretical computations made it possible to detect a great seasonal variability

of the geographic position of the south polar front zone -- up to a total of about
8° in latitude.

However. the author of [14] notes the erroneousness of some premises adopted in
[11]. These led to a discrepancy between the theoretical computed values of dis-

placement of the frontal zone and the values cited by other authors based on ex-
perimental estimates. At the same time it was demonstrated that Deacon's ideas
concerning the decisive effect of deep and bottom waters, and also bottom topo-
graphy, on the position of the front agree with the results of hydrological ob-
servations. This same study [16] gives a hydrological section along 55‘" through
the region of the south polar frontal zone (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows that over a
distance of 20 miles (between stations 4 and 5) the temperature decrease is 2’.

Data in the literature make it possible to conclude that there is a relatively
low variability in position of the south polar frontal zone.

However. it is demonstrated in sources [1. 7, 9, 10, 15] that the positions of the
SPFZ substantially differ from one anather (Pig. 2).

front zone from ATLAS OF THE OCEANS.

R. P. Bulatov [7] defined ocean fronts as the boundaries between macroscale systems
of ocean circulations having an opposite direction of novenents of waters situated
in different climatic zones and discriminated on the basis of the general back-
ground of geostrophic circulation. Such a scheme was compiled using dynamic heights
computed from averaged observations at different spatial-temporal scales (for

one, five and forty degree squares with mean monthly. mean annual and semiannual

values). The zone of the south polar front virtually does not react to a change in
averaging scales.

The authors of [9], on the basis of data on geostrophic circulation, prepared from
mean long-term hydrological data for 5° squares, defined oceanic fronts as re-
gions of crowding of the dynamic contour lines between adjacent circulations.

V. H. Gruzinov [10] developed a scheme of geographic zones in the world ocean,
the basis for which is the natural boundaries which are the main oceanic fronts.
The south polar frontal zone is one of those zones in the ocean between two main
circulations and the boundary between different vertical water structures.

In the ATLAS 0? THE OCEANS [l] the south polar frontal zone is represented as a
boundary region of displacement of different types of water structure.

V. N. Stepanov [16] demonstrated that the position of five types of fronts, among
which one is the south polar front, is closely associated with geographic zonal-
ity. The south polar front is less active and is discriminated from the maximum

horizontal gradients of thermohaline characteristics, the maximum vertical and
horizontal current velocities, and the discontinuities of macrocirculation systems

and water masses. 0n the basis of computations of circulation in the entire layer
of ocean waters in accordance with the A. S. Sarkisyan model [13] Stepanov deter-
mined the position of quasistationary fronts, also examined the vertical position
of the front and discriminated a stable position of the dynamic zones in the en-
tire ocean layer at O, 200, $00, 1000. 2000 and 3000 m.

A special point of view on the genetic characteristics of the south polar zone is
expressed in [8, 12, 22].

The thought that the boundary between the warm and cold waters of the ocean emerges
at the surface in the region of the polar fronts was expressed for the first time
by Defant [22] in 1928.

N. P. Bulgakov [8], on the basis of his investigations. demonstrated a correlation
between the main thermocline and the polar fronts.

v. V. Klepikov [12] pointed out that at approximately 40's the isotherms character-
izing the main thermocline rise toward the ocean surface. The mean annual tempera-
ture of the water surface here is 3.5'; it is characteristic for the lower boundary
of the main thermocline. The sharply expressed maximum water temperature gradients
at the horizons 100 and 200 m serve as proof that the SPPZ is associated with pro-
cesses manifested not only at the ocean surface, but also in the deep layers. The
mean horizontal temperature gradient is approximately 0.l°/km. The fronts asso-
ciated with the main thermocline are called the main fronts. They are usually situ-
ated at 60-60'3. The frontal layer extends to a depth of 500-1000 m and the frontal
surface slopes to the horizon in the range from several minutes of angle to 1-2’.

In [25] the south polar frontal zone is characterized as a region of high meridion-
al temperature gradients observed in the surface waters around Antarctica at 50’s.
0n the basis of a review of the studies it was possible to discriminate some of

its characteristics. The lower boundary of the zone is situated at a depth of 200-
300 m and the isotherm 2°C is characteristic for it. The temperature minimum is
related to the seasonal thermocline and the position of the front varies from 44

to 60 S.

Pig. 3. Position of south polar frontal zone.

In [23] the author cites a diagram of the south polar frontal zone. From this it
can be judged that the width of the zone varies in the range 20-200 km (Pig. 3).

Such a diversity of judgments concerning the spatial-temporal variability and gen-
etic characteristics of the south polar frontal zone makes it necessary to sel-

ect the parameters of zones in definite ranges for computing the generated inter-
nal waves.

The section cited in [la] confirms the correctness of choice of a two-layer model

of the south polar frontal zone (Fig. l). The upper layer of the frontal zone model
is characterized by a horizontal density gradient. The SPPZ arOund Antarctica varies
from 45 to 60°s; the maxim depth here on the average is lo km.

The thickness of the upper layer (frontal layer), since the ocean in the model is
assured to be two-layered, varies, according to data from different authors. from
100 to 1000 m. The density in the neighborhood of the investigated frontal zone is
taken from [15].

As the initial system of equations describing wave movement within the frontal
zone we write a system of equations of long waves

All the notations, description of the model and solution method were set forth in

[3, 5].

As demonstrated by the computations, the amplitudes of the internal waves at the
periphery of the fron a1 zone (regions I, III, fig. 1 [3, 5]) are essentially de-
pendent on the width with a fixed value of the density drop Apmp- P13 - P11)

within the frontal zone. The width of the SPPZ is not constant in different regions
(Fig. 3) and varies from 20 to 200 km. The greatest values of the amplitudes of in-
ternal waves are observed in those regions where l is minimum (regions b1, b3; d1.
d3) and can attain 502 of the amplitude of the oncoming barotropic wave. Relative-
1y small values of the amplitudes of internal waves must be expected in those
places where the width 2 is maximum (regions a1, a3: c1, c3; [1, [3). True. the
mini-um values of the amplitudes of internal waves in this case may not be attained
with the largest u z - 200 km for the sen). but with lesser values (mastszoo
km). The maximum values of the amplitudes of internal waves in the regions a1, a3;
c1, c3; [1, [3 do not exceed 101 of the amplitude of the oncoming barotrop c
wave.

Since the thickness hl of the layer of the frontal zone in different regions (ac-
cording to data from different authors) varies from 100 to 1000 m, then, assuming
the mean depth of the layer to be equal to 500 m, we find that due to the deviation
of hl from the mean value the above-mentioned values of the amplitudes of internal
waves can vary. In the region 500<h1<1000 m they can increase by 5-202, and in
the region 100<h1<500 -- decrease by a factor of 1.1-2.5.

The considered SPFZ falls in the limits 45-60'5. As indicated by computations, the
deviation of ¢ from its mean value (7.“... - 52°) exerts little influence on the
amplitudes of the internal waves and does not exceed 102 of their values, corres-

ponding to SP - 9’mean'

The dependence of the amplitudes of the internal waves on frequency 0' of the on-
coming wave is more important. The values of the amplitudes cited above correspond
to O'- 7-10'5sec'1' for 0‘- 1.6-10"" the amplitudes of the internal waves are less
than forO“ . 7.10’5sec‘1. Under the condition 20<Z<50 km they are less by 10—301

and with so<£<2oo they are less by a factor of 1.5-4.5.

It is characteristic that the frontal zone, with its intersection by a barotropic
wave, plays the role of a source of internal waves moving in both directions from
its boundaries. The amplitudes of the waves propagating in the direction of the
barotropic wave are greater than the amplitudes of the internal waves moving in the
opposite direction (reflected waves). In the regions z~ 200 km their values are
close, whereas in the regions l~ 20 km they differ by a factor of 5-10.

[Text] Abstract: It is shown that with an increase
in the Vgisdld-Brent frequency the energy
density of internal waves decreases as a re-
sult of a limitation of the amplitudes of
waves due to local shear hydrodynamic in-
stability. The theoretically derived depen-
dence of the fluxes of the kinetic energy
of internal waves to turbulence on the
ViisalaLBrent frequency agrees with experi-
mental data.

The experimental data obtained in the course of implementation of work under the
"Polimode" program on the 14th, 16th, 17th and 18th voyages of the scientific re-
search vessel “Akademik Vernadskiy" indicate that the density of potential energy
of the internal waves is not constant; it is dependent on local hydrological con-
ditions [1]. For example, in the region of the seasonal thermocline in the "Poli-
node" polygon with an increase in the Vaisala-Brent frequency N from 3 to 15 cycles
per hour the potential energy of the wave field E decreases by more than an order
of magnitude. 0n the other hand, the rate of influx of kinetic energy to small-
scale turbulence E , determined by the method described in [3], considerably in-
creases [2].

Thus, it is entirely natural to postulate the existence of an interrelationship
between these two processes. Figure 1 shows the relative distribution of z and
0'} - the normalized dispersion of vertical displacements, proportional to the
density of potential energy of internal waves. The physical nature of this inter-
relationship is evidently as follows: with an increase in vertical density gradi-
ents as a result of limitation of the amplitude of waves due to the appearance of
local hydrodynamic instability of the wave movement the wave energy decreases.

The energy supply of small-scale turbulence occurs due to the dissipation of wave
energy. It is shown in the article that under definite conditions with an increase

in the Vaisals—Brent frequency the rate of dissipation of wave energy increases

The presently existing empirical model of the spectrum of internal waves, construct-
ed by Garrett and Hunk [6] on the basis of a generalization of experimental data,
does not take into account the dependence of the energy density of waves on local
hydrological conditions, and accordingly, does not give an explanation of its ob-

served inconstancy. The density of potential energy of internal waves is propor-
tional to the normlized dispersion of vertical displacements, which is determined

using the formula [7]

cated spectral interval are 0.1 a: , whereas according to experimental data 6" var-

ies by more than an order of magnitude with a change in the vaisilg-Brunt frequency

what is the reason for the decrease in 0'3 with an increase in the Vlisalg-Brunt
frequency? It should be noted that Garrett and Hunk examined an isotropic wave
field in the absence of shear velocity and did not discuss the problem of the

role of hydrodynamic instability in the formation of the spectrum of internal
waves. Phillips, for a three-layer model of the ocean with a vaisaiaLBrunt fre-

The upper baundary for the energy density of internal waves decreases with an in:

Brent frequency slowly changes in distances comparable with the scales of internal
waves the level at which there 18 a limitation of their amplitude as a result of the

However, if 3W? 2 increases with an increase in the Vaisala-Brunt frequency,

the theoretical curve in the case of large V'a'isala-Brunt frequencies exceeds the
experimental data. The presence of currents with a vertical velocit shear will
change the energy influx to turbulence, in particular, witha 2U/az <0 the rate
of influx of kinetic energy will be less than was determined in accordance with

(21)

Thus. the derived dependences of the rate of influx of kinetic energy on the condi-
tions of density stratification are confirmed by the cited experimental data.

[Text] Abstract: The effect of a film on the at-
tenuation of surface waves is investigated.

The dispersion law was formulated: a pre-

cise solution of the frequency equation is
found. For any values of the parameters of

the problem simple asymptotic representa-
tions are obtained for the dimensionless
complex frequency s as a function of the
wave number £ (and wave lengths L). The de-
pendence of the period of oscillations and
the logarithmic decrement of attenuation
on wave length is found.

In many practical problems in geophysics it is desirable to investigate the in-
fluence of a surface film on the wave movement of a fluid. The studies of V. G.
Levich were devoted to this problem [2]. He examined the problem of the natural

oscillations of a fluid with a surface-active film taken into account. he found ap-
proximate solutions of the frequency equation under definite conditions superposed

on the parameters of the problem.

In addition, studies [1, 3, a] were devoted to the problem of the natural oscil-
lations of the free boundary of a fluid without a film. In [1] the a1a1ytical de-
pendence between the frequency of the free oscillations and the wave length was
investigated numerically by the Graffe method for a number of values of parameters
of the problem. An analytical dependence of the complex frequency on wave number

was found by E. N. Potetyunko in [4].

In this article we give an analysis of influence of the film on the logarithmic

decrement of attenuation and the wave period for the problem of the natural os-
cillations of a semi-infinite fluid covered with a film. The influence of the

film is "convayed" into the boundary condition of the problem.

1. Formulation of problem. we will examine free oscillations, periodic along the
Ox-axis, for an infinitely deep two-layer viscous fluid occupying the lower half-
space,

Comparing the results with the results for free oscillations of a fluid without a
film we find that the film increases the logarithmic decrement of attenuation of

a wave and increases the period of oscillations. The critical length of a wave,
less than which the movement has an aperiodic character. increases.

[Text] Abstract: In the first approximation 8
study was made of the influence of hori-
zontal and vertical exchange of momentum
on the dissipation of internal waves in
a stratified ocean with a real density dis-
tribution. It has been established that in
the region of the short-wave spectrum of
frequencies the first approximation is in-
adequate; in the case of long waves there
is a similarity with the law of dissipation
of surface waves and it can be assumed that
the first approximation to all intents and
purposes is a precise solution of the prob-

tem.

In [5] The author presented a theoretical investigation of the influence of her-
izontal and verical exchange of momentum on the dissipation of surface and inter-
nal waves in a stratified ocean. It was assumed that the solution of the "ideal"

problem is known. But in [6] it was impossible to find even one fundamental solu-
tion "*0 of equation (6) in a general case. Two methods are now known for overcom-
3

ing th difficulty.

First, having an analytical expression for the density value, it is possible to
find approximate solutions of this equation outside the turning points and in

their neighborhood; then asymptotic splicing of these solutions is carried out

[7]. Proceeding along these lines, it is necessary to approximate the density meas-
urement data by the function f3(z) and then find an approximate solution of the
problem.

On the other hand [3,6], the ocean can be regarded as N layers of fluid [0, H] -
[0, H1) + (H1, H2] + ... + [RN-1’ RN]. The density measurement data for the entire
depth of the real ocean can be approximated by some continuous function for which
in each of N sectors it is easy to obtain one precise sought-for solution H (for
example, for [0 - [030 exp k z). Satisfying the boundary conditions for at achment
at the bottom, {he equality o the velocity and stress components at the discontin-
uities and the absence of stresses at the free surface, we obtain a solution of

the formulated problem.

in addition to the surface wave. another set of nonattenuating internal waves
develops. In the presence of vertical and horizontal exchange of momentum, all
the waves attenuate with distance.

For the purpose of finding the value of the decrement of attenuation U'we made
computations using density measurement data [1] (Fig. 1,2) and [2] (Figures 3,
4). The figures denote the numbers of the internal modes to which the curves cor-
respond; the fictitious parts of r1 and r2 are represented in m'1. In this case

"I: n". W

(3 is the number of the mode) k2 - 5'103 for curve a and k2 - 10‘ in all the re-
maining cases.

An analysis of the computations shows that for clarifying the influence of ver-
tical exchange Az on the dissipation of internal waves a first approximation of
the expansion in 5,2 is inadequate since in the short-wave region it tends to 0.
The j-th mode attains its maximum with a wavelength ‘Aj" BH/JFT. For longer
waves the r2 value changes proportionally to (l + i) ,/ci . Depending on the
stratification, different modes attenuate with distance differently. Cases are
possible when the lower modes (the waves are longer) attenuate more rapidly than
the higher modes. It can only be assumed, by analogy with surface waves [4],
that with )JH >10 :2 will be virtually the precise value of the decrement of

attenuation 5;, caused by the presence of exchange A2.

what is the influence of horizontal exchange AL on the dissipation of internal
waves and is a first approximation adequate for clarifying the qualitative and
quantitative aspects of this influence? With an increase in frequency. regard-
less of the mode number, in the case of long waves the r1 value increases as (T2

and is equal approximately to
_ all/\Igﬂ “+900,
’7" ”(n-out

in the case of short waves the order of the increase increases and r1 has an os-
cillatory character. In all probability, as in the case of surface waves [A],

for a clarification of the influence of the horizontal exchange of momentum AL
on the dissipation of internal waves it is adequate to use a first approximation.
An exhaustive answer can be given only after comparison of the results of this

work with a second approximation or with a precise solution of the formulated
problem.

[Text] Abstract: A study was made of the influence
of vertical and horizontal exchange of momentum
on the dissipation of waves in a stratified
fluid of constant depth. The solution is found
by expansion of the sought-for functions into a
series in two small parameters with an accuracy
to values of the second order of magnitude in-
clusive. A comparison of the derived expressions
with the precise solution of the problem is
presented in the example of a homogeneous ocean.

The characteristics of internal waves in an ideal stratified fluid of constant
depth have been studied quite well [2, 9, 10]. A study was also made of the in-
fluence of viscosity on the dissipation of surface and internal waves in the

case of a piecewise-constant [5, 7, 11] or exponental [6, 8] density distribution.

In this article a study is made of the influence of vertical A2 and horizontal
AL exchange of momentum on the dissipation of waves in an unbounded basin of
constant depth H with an arbitrary stratification. It is assumed that the coef-
ficients A2 and AL are constant.

Within the framework of a linear theory, with Coriolis force taken into account,
the motion of the fluid is described by the equations

It can be seen (13) that the influence of viscosity on the velocity field is re-
flected most substantially at the bottom and at the free surface. The second and
third terms of the expressions for the horizontal velocity components u and v rep-
resent, in fact, a mathematical description of the change in the velocity in the

bottom boundary layer. The last terms of the first two expressions (l3) determine
the boundary layer at the free surface. With a high horizontal exchange value it

can attain values comparable to the bottom boundary layer.

Comparing the solid, dashed and dotted curves we see that in the region of long
waves they all coincide. However, in the region of short waves with AL>> A: they

also coincide (curves 3, 4, 6); with Al. - A2 the .values of the dashed and dotted
curves are half as great as the true; value. This is attributable to the fact
that for short waves the contributions of the AL and Az values to the 3’ value are
equivalent. However, numerical computations were made taking into account only the
first approximation of the expansion in the small parameter 8 , which with to D)
1 becomes equal to zero. In the range of waves with a length of the order of sev-
eral depths, regardless of the relationship between AL and A2, the approximation
(lb) seems quite good; the short-wave and long-wave approximations (15) give some-
what exaggerated results.

In connection with the above, it is desirable to examine the second approximation
of the expansion in the small parameter 8 . For short waves

The ti. and r5 values. regardless of the length of the surface waves, exert no ap-
preciable influence on the value of the decrement of attenuation.

Thus, the first approximation for € and the second for 62 give a virtually pre-
cise solution of the formulated pro lem.
