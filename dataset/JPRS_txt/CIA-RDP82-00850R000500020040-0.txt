[Article by V. V. Bogorodskiy, G. V. Trepov and B. A. Pedorov]

[Text] The focusing of energy in the propagation of waves in inhomogeneous media

has been repeatedly analyzed in the past [2]. However, in recently published studies
on radio echo sounding of media [for example. 1, 3, 6] the focusing factor is not
taken into account.

in this article the focusing factor is examined in considerable detail applicable
to radio echo, slant and vertical sounding of media.

In a homogeneous medium at the distance r from a point radiation source the density
of the power flux 1Tb is equal to

1T0 - Pad/MHZ. (1)

In a layered-inhomogeneous medium, where n - n(z), as a result of refraction the
density of the power flux Trat this sane distance is different.

The ratio

"rd-"7 (2)

is called the focusing factor.

We will determine the focusing factor for a layered-inhomogeneous medium, in par-
ticular including here the case of wave propagation in two homogeneous media with
a plane discontinuity. Assume that the radiation source is situated at the origin

of coordinates (0‘0 is the glancing angle of the ray at the pain; of emergence; °‘h
is the glancing angle at the observation point at the depth h; R is the horizontal

range).

For an annular element ds of the area of the wave front included between the rays
emerging at the angles etc and 0‘0 + deco, we obtain ds I 23211 sinothdk. Taking

into account that dR - ~aR/aoto dato (the minus means that with h - const a greater
010 corresponds to lesser R), we determine

Case of scattering plane surface. When the scattering plane surface is situated in

However, when the scattering plane is situated in the far zone of the sounder, the

sounding of the medium from the air the contribution of the focusing factor to
the total attenuation of the radio echo signal in all cases is from ~20 lg n to
+20 lg n. For ice it is equal to from -6 to +6 db; therefore, the circumstance
that some authors (for example, the author of [1]) did not take the focusing fac-
tor into account (although it was nentioned) in computations of the total attenu-
ation of the radio echo signal in a glacier, did not lead to such great errors as

would cause a serious discrepancy between the computed and experimental data. How-
ever, without question, the dependence of the focusing factor on the ratio h yer,
ha is one of the reasons for the appreciable change in attenuation of the radio
echo signal observed in practical work with an increase in aircraft flight alti-
tude during radio echo measurements of the thickness of glaciers. In part, there-
fore, a survey of thicknesses is usually made from aircraft flying low over the
surface of glaciers.

It follows from expressions (19), (21) and (24) that it is always relatively more
advantageous (bearing in mind only the focusing factor) to sound thick layers than
to sound thin layers. This must be taken into account when sounding floating sea
and fresh ice. The influence of the focusing factor should be extremely important
in the sounding of media with large n values, for example, for fresh water, for
which at frequencies in the meter wavelength region n::9.

[Text] The problem of the total attenuation of a signal is extremely important in
refining a model of radio wave propagation during radio echo sounding of media,

investigation of the electric characteristics of ice, and also in selecting fre-
quencies and potentials of scunding apparatus for the sounding of glaciers. 0n

the basis of the general concepts of the theory of radio wave propagation and con-
siderable material on the attenuation of electromagnetic waves during the radio
echo sounding of glaciers it is possible to visualize the following additive mech-
anisms of signal attenuation.

1. Geometrical losses due to.spatial divergence of the wave front (N800).
2. Losses due to focusing. caused by refraction at the air-glacier surface bound-

ary anda change of density in the upper part of the glacier (NfOC).

3. Absorption (Nab.)s

a. Losses with reflection from the glacier-glacier bed boundary (Nr9f1).

5. Scattering by the glacier surface and inhomogeneities within it (“scat)-

6. Noncoincidenceof thenolarization of the reflected signal and polarization of
the receiving antenna as a result of wave depolarization during propagation in
the glacier (Npol).

The total attenuation, in general, is a random value and this is manifested in fluc-
tuations of the reflected signal. but the great number of measurements of the total
attenuation makes it possible to carry out averaging and check the correctness of
the adopted computation model under different conditions (thickness of glacier, mean
annual temperature, parameters of apparatus). In addition. the contribution of some
mechanisms can be determined from special experiments.

An investigation of the influence of temperature of the surface layer of the glacier
on attenuation of the radio signal was carried out in the neighborhood of Mirnyy 0b-
servatory in Antarctica from 11 January through 6 February 1967 at a frequency of
41:0 MHz. The collected data on the excess of the signal over the receiver noise and
air temperature near the ice surface are given in Fig. 2. The results of the experi-
ment show that at a frequency of 460 MHz there is a strong dependence of attenuation
of the radio echo signal on the tenperature of the surface layer of the glacier.
llith thawing at the glacier surface the attenuation increases. The greatest incre-
ments in attenuation (about 20 db) were registered with the falling of precipita-
tion in the form of rain or snow mixed with rain. The maximum attenuation of the
radio echo signal in the surface layer of a thawing glacier is more than 30 db.
Similar results were obtained during the Eleventh Soviet Antarctic Expedition, when
after the falling of rain the naxinum thicknesses attainable when making measure-
ments at a frequency of 660 ME: decreased from 300-350 In to 100-150 In (near the
shore), which corresponds to an increase in attenuation by 20 db or more.

For an investigation of attenuation of the radar signal in a broad frequency range
on the Fourteenth Soviet Antarctic Expedition on a path with an extent of 132 km

to the south of Holodeahnaya Station specialists carried out sounding of the glacier
by means of a multifrequency sounder and a sounder with a working frequency of 60
MHz. [Some results were published in [2].] From a comparison of the total attenua-
tion of the radio echo signal with sounding at six frequencies it is possible to

draw' the following conclusions.

1. The curves of change in attenuation along the path for frequencies of 60, 70,
100, 140, 200, 460 MHz are sinilar and are very strongly correlated with glacier
thickness.

2. 0n the average the difference in signal levels in db at different frequencies
is almost constant, regardless of the glacier thickness (220-950 m) and its mean
annual temperature (“mean fron -4 to ~25°C). that is, the temperature dependence
_ of total attenuation and its dependence on thickness are approximately identical
at frequencies from 60 to 460 MHz.

3. The strong dependence of total attenuation on temperature is confirmed; for ex-
ample. whereas at the 10th kilometer (tmean - -8°C) a signal level of 10 db cor-
responded to a thickness of 260 m, at the thh kilometer (tmean '- 16°C) it

900 m.

6. In the coastal zone (approximately to kilometer 15) the difference in total at-'
tenuations for low and high frequencies increases. The losses at low frequencies
(100, 70 MHz) become smaller relative to those for the higher frequencies.

A comparison of the computed values of total attenuation obtained on the basis of
expression (5) for absorptioa temperatures tabs equal to 007stngln and 0-9Cmean
and experimental data shows that:

-- the general shape of the computed and experimental curves is identical;

-- in the sector to the 15th kilometer the experimentally determined attenuation
is greater than the computed value for tabs . 0.75tmean by 3-12 db, which can be
attributed to scattering in the upper thawing layer of the glacier; losses in the
upper layer increase with an increase in frequency and with approach to the shore-
line;

-- in the sector 15-48 km, 59-69 km, 116-116 km the data computed for tabs '
0.75tmean and the experimental data coincide on the average with an accuracy to
Z-b db;

-- in the sector 121-130 km the measured attenuation is less than the computed val-
ue for t be - 0-75tmean by 3-6 db; in this sector the absorption temperature for
the glacier falls in the range 0-75tmean<tab8< 0-9cmean‘

The results of experimental measurements of the total attenuation of a radio echo
signal at frequencies 60, 70, 100, 140, 200 and 440 H32 and comparison of the com-
puted data with the experimental data indicate the correctness of the adopted
model of signal propagation during the sounding of glaciers. In accordance with
this model it follows that:

l. The geometrical losses were computed using the law llhz.

2. It is necessary to take into account the focusing factor, as demonstrated in

[l] (for sounding of the glacier directly from its surface the gain due to focus-
ing is 5 db). .

3. The losses with reflection from the glacier bed must be taken into account in
accordance with expression (1).

a. The losses in scattering must be considered approximately 1 db for cold glaciers
and must be considered to increase to 20-30 db when there is thawing at the surface.
5. When computing absorption it is necessary to know the absorption temperature;

it can vary in some limits, such as 0.75-0.9 of the mean annual value, which does
not cause significant errors in computing total attenuation.

However, it is more correct to solve the inverse problem: using all the remaining
components of total attenuation, discriminate from the measured attenuation the
losses in absorption and ascertain the absorption temperature, which characterizes
the temperature regime of the glacier.

During subsequent Antarctic Expeditions (Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth) the
measurements of attenuation were made along the same route as on the Fourteenth
Expedition, at frequencies of 60. 213 and 460 “3:. In the generalization we used
random samples of attenuations. Qualitatively (and quantitatively with an accuracy
to the range of fluctuations of amplitude) these results coincided with those

ed by A. H. Shalgin and L. A. Pedorinchik in the neighborhood of Hirnyy station

in 1971/1972 in polygons measuring 5 x 5 km, situated at the 57th and 153d km from
the shoreline. Measurements in each polygon were made along 22 intersecting lines
at intervals of 250 m. Samples were taken from the observational series for the
ranges in glacier thickness Ah - 100 m. In selecting the A h interval it was taken
into account that, on the one hand, the samples should be adequately long, but on
the other hand, the A; h value cannot be too great since in this case the regular
change in signal amplitude caused by the dispersion of electromagnetic energy will
be great.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of probabilities (repetition rates) of attenuation

attenuation caused by the influence of random factors (scattering, depolarization)
in the case of a constant temperature regime of the glacier (tabs - const) and an
approximately constant thickness (hasconst). Figure 3 shows that the probabilities

of attenuation have a Rayleigh distribution. In polygon 1 the mean attenuation val-
ues are 136 and 138 db for mean thicknesses of 1000 and 1100 m, in polygon 2 --

about 157 db for thicknesses of 1800 and 1900 m. These mean attenuation values once
again confirm the correctness of the adopted attenuation computation scheme; they

correspond to glacier absorption temperatures tabs - -11°C for polygon 1 and tabs

regime of the glacier in the measurement regions.

[Article by V. V. Bogorodskiy, G. V. Trepov and B. A. Fedorov]

[Text] Radio echo sounding of glaciers is carried out in the meter wavelength

range [1]. When the resolution of the sounder is small in range and angle the
structure of the signal received from the glacier bed region is quite complex.

The echo signal is a series of resolved pulses with an amplitude which in general
decreases. [By "resolved" is meant pulses whose peaks are resolved on the oscillo-

gram.] If the sounder is moved horizontally, the echo signal fluctuates and its
different parts fluctuate differently [5, 6]. This phenomenon has been called" spa-

tial fading" [6]. The reasons for this are unevenness of the bed, the presence
of morainsl inclusions, and also a change in signal polarization_[2], nonuniform-
ity of the glacier, etc.

A study by Halford [6] discusses an interesting practical application of “spatial
fading." In particular, it was shown (and this has been confirmed by data from
geodetic measurements) that with the carrying out of repeated registration of a
bottom signal along paths it is possible to determine the displacement of the

glacier surface relative to the bedrock relief.

with respect to fluctuations per se, Halford determined the periodic length L of

fadings of si male as functions of the partial time‘f from the moment of arrival
of an echo (for a point with a glacier thickness of about 1090 m). For a theor—

etical estimate of the L value Walford used an expression from an unpublished
study by Berry:

 

L __l Ill-5L0:
2l/2 '/:I:;:(;;:F';-;:T - (1)

where v is the velocity of propagation of a radio echo signal in the ice; J\ is
the length (in the ice) of the sounder working wave; h is glacier thickness; 1

is partial time3'c was determined by Berry, and in Halford's words, "differs
negligibly from‘t" when computing L.

There can be a different approach to the problem of study of fluctuations of bot-
tom signals, and, in particular, fluctuations of their amplitude. It appears that
a knowledge of the characteristics of spatial fading, such as the statistical

l6

characteristics, can exert a substantial influence on solution of a number of prob-
lems of practical importance, such as the choice of frequencies for measurements

of displacement of the surface, evaluation of the effectiveness of accumulation
of the energy of reflected signals during the sounding of a glacier from surface

transportation and an aircraft and estimation of the size of irregularities of
the bed comparable with the wavelength of the irradiating wave.

Such an approach also determined the conditions for conducting the experiment.

Note: Each L value with one and the same thickness is given for different measure-
ment paths.

First, for carrying out a frequency analysis of signal fluctuations we used multi-
frequency sounding: frequencies 60, 213 and 440 MHz.

Second, for the purpose of clarifying the stability of spatial fading and the de-
pendence of the statistical characteristics, especially the autocorrelation radius
of amplitude fluctuations, on glacier thickness the sounding was carried out at
several points where the ice thicknesses were different.

Third, since the electromagnetic signal, in propagating in the glacier, changes its
polarization and the nature of the relief is hypothetically different in the direc-
tions of the flow lines of the glacier and perpendicular to it, two lines were run
at each measurement point: north-south and east-west.

The measurements were made on the Sixteenth Soviet Antarctic Expedition in 1971
[A]. The work region was Holodezhnaya Station-Kilometer 105 to the south of Halo-
dezhnaya. Signals from the oscillogrsph screen were registered on photographic
film with movement of the transport vehicle with the sounders along paths whose
length in different experiments was from 20 to 100 m. The registry frequency was
200-250 frames per 100 m of path; an amplitude signal mark was used; scanning was
type A.

In processing of the collected data attention was concentrated on the first pulse

-- the echo arrival pulse, since it, passing through the glacier alon the short-
est distance, carries the basic information and as a rule has the max mum

amplitude of all the resolved bottom pulses. For the first pulses we constructed
"amplitude-distance" diagrams, histograms of amplitudes and autocorrelation func-
tions. Among the autocorrelation characteristics we obtained the 1. values as the
distances from the maximum of the autocorrelation function to the first minim-I.

Table 1 gives the L values for frequencies 60, 213 and £40 MHz, as well as their
mean arithmetical values Lmean for discrete ice thicknesses. Here we also give
the lengths of the working waves of the sounder in the ice ).and the durations of
the pulses 1 “1“ radiated by them. Figure 1 show the experimental 1. values as
functions of and 2 . The figure shows that the experimental 1. values do not fit
into a linear dependence on 2, although it follows from expression (1) that there
is a proportionality of L to the values 2, h and 1/ ﬂ. In addition, it is un-
clear from expression (1) what value {'should have for the first resolved bottom
signal. Clearly it is necessary to seek a suitable approximation of the experi-
mental data represented in Fig. l and discuss its physical sense. ‘

In order to obtain the initial expressions we will assume that in the case of an

of the echo signal; these points are situated in the glacier bed. During sounding

It can be seen from equation (5) that in the spectrum of fluctuations of signal

frequencies fmax and those close to it are emphasized. Accordingly, the period

Expression (8) is written not only as corresponding to the conditions of the ex-
periments, but also as a more graphic representation. In particular, from this
expression it can be seen clearly that for the first signal it is necessary that
T be determined in such a way that the L1 values, computed using formulas (7) and
(8), coincide with the experimental estimate of 1..

If the first signal is resolved, the upper frequency in the spectrum of fluctua-
tions of the first signal should not exceed the frequency which corresponds to
{max = ‘C ulse' Accordingly, the period of the spatial fading for the first signal
can be determined as 1.1 - 1/2fmax with ‘me - 171,01“. However, such an approach to
the theoretical estimate of I. is not confirmed by experimental data, according to
which I. obviously is not dependent on "pulser in any case for the durations cited

in Table 1.

ent on )and h. [So it appears, extremely frequently for different types of sur-
faces, especially sea surfaces [3].] With such an assumption L is not dependent on

noted that since expression (8), with equation (9) taken intop account, reads as

an estimate of n on the basis of experimental data must be accomplished in accord-
ance with the fact of a proportionality of the L.va1ue to the root of n.

Two estimates of n for 1.0 and 37 results of measurements (of 62) are given in
Table 2.

arithmetical value n. The hum value corresponds to the mean arithmetical value

The legitimacy of these estimates is based on the approximate symmetry of the dis-
tribution of specific/E values, computed on the basis of expression (10) relative
to the maximum; the maximum of the distribution is attained with £153.10; nzll.5.

Expression (10) characterizes scattering on the bed in the case of vertical sound-
ing of glaciers and makes it possible to predict the value of the period of spatial
fading of the arrival signal.

However, it'must be remembered that the value for different types of surfaces

underlying the glacier can differ somewhat ron that obtained in this study. In
particular, it is possible to expect lesser than values when sounding glaciers
having a smoothed lower boundary, such as shelf glaciers, and large values when
the bed is strongly incised.

[Text] In an investigation of the electrical parameters of saline ice in free space
by means of apparatus operating in the centimeter range it has been noted that

the degree of homogeneity of the properties of ice in the thickness of samples
exerts a great influence on the character of the primary experimental data.*

In the measurement of homogeneous samples with sufficiently great absorption the
dependences of the displacement x of the minimum of the standing wave in the meas-

urement line and attenuation T on sample thickness d have the form of straight
lines. Using these dependences it is easy to determine the relative dielectric
constant 5' and the tangent of the angle of losses tg 5 :

guide; A d is change in sample thickness;A , A '1‘ are the changes in X and ‘1‘ cor-
responding to the value A d; N - A't/Ad is specific absorption.

For samples with a sharply expressed inhomogeneity of the properties of ice in
the thickness, for example, with a layered change in density and salinity, the
constructed dependences x - f(d) and '1' - ¢(d) differ from linear. In the sea ice
cover such changes are especially clearly expressed in its upper part (snow with a
density changing in the thickness of the layer. layer of ice breccia, water-snow

layer). In the lower part of the ice cover, as in its upper part, it is possible
to observe a substantial change in ice salinity without sharply expressed changes
in the structural and textural criteria. Figure 1 shows the possible changes in
the x and T values as a function of sample thickness. The mean values 5' and

tg£ of all three samples are arbitrarily assumed to be equal and can be determin-
ed from expressions (1) and (2). Depending on from what layer the thickness of the
sample decreases, for one and the same inhomogeneous sample there will be curves
of different types (curves 2 or 3 in Pig. 1).

The interpretation of the dependence of X on the thickness of a multilayer sample
is more complex since the 8 ' value for the entire sample does not conform to the
additivity rule. In an investigation of such nonlinear dependences for computation
of 2' it is necessary to approximate the curves 2 or 3 (see Fig. l) by a series
of straight lines and represent the sample in the form of a group of capacitors
connected in series with losses. If one layer of the sample is characterized by the
parameters C1, R1, and the other by the parameters Cg, R , by equating the imped-
ance of the circuit to the resistance of an equivalent circuit (with the parameters
C and R) it is possible to obtain the following expressions:

In an example we will demonstrate the process of computation of the electric para-
meters of the layers of an inhomogeneous sample extracted from the upper part of

white ice. The measurements were made in a marginal part of the Bering Sea at an
air temperature -8°C. The mean salinity of the sample was 2.68°/oo; it consisted

of an unconsolidated layer of white ice with large bubbles with a thickness of 13
cm, undergoing an abrupt transition into a transparent dense layer of ice with a
thickness 6 cm. The working of the sample for the purpose of reducing its thickness
was from the direction of the unconsolidated layer. The curves constructed on the
basis of experimental points (Fig. 2) are approximated by the straight lines 2 and
3. First using the straight lines 1 and 2 we find the mean value for the sample

N1 - 0.71 db/cm and the value N2 - 1.35 db/cm for a layer of dense ice. Then we
compute the refractive indices n1 . 1.576, n2 . 1.742, and taking into account the
conditions of smallness of the attenuation factor k (N 3.23 db/cm) -- the rela-
tive dielectric constants 8'1 - ni - 2.68; 8'2 - n; - 3.06. Using expression (9)

[Text] In selecting a method for measuring the parameters of saline ice in the SH?
range it is necessary that two principal factors be taken into account: the possib-
ility of the existence of. large ice crystals and large inhomogeneities in the nat-
ural ice cover and also the presence therein of a liquid phase and salts causing a
considerable absorption of electromagnetic energy. The first factor requires the
fabrication of such a measurement apparatus as will make it possible to obtain in-
formation on the averaged electric parameters of a sufficiently great volume of
inhomogeneous sea ice. Apparatus in which the measurement element used is segments
of waveguides filled with ice [3, lo] only in the first approximation must be re-
garded as suitable for investigations of natural ice. Information on the parameters
of ice of a considerable volume can be obtained by using optical measurement meth-
ods [1, 2]. The second factor determines the requirements on the technical possibil-
ities of the apparatus, that is, on its response, accuracy and energy potential. In
addition, due to the great absorption of electromagnetic energy there is no pos-
sibility for carrying out in situ measurements of the mean electrical parameters

of the entire thickness of the ice cover. Accordingly, samples of ice of suf-
ficiently large size should be used in the measurement apparatus as the object to
be measured, taking into account the enumerated requirements.

In this article we give a description of an apparatus for measuring the refractive
index and the specific absorption of ice at a wavelength of 3 cm based on the op-
tical method for measuring the complex coefficient of transparency of samples in
free space and constructed using a high-response balanced circuit.

We will examine the incidence of an electromagnetic wave with the amplitude A1 - 1
from the air (medium 1) on a sample (medium 2) of ice with the thickness d. Assume
that the measured parameters will be the modulus and phase of a wave propagating
into the air (medium 3) through the samle, that is

The amplitude-modulated signal received from the generator is divided into two parts.

signal, is directed through the uncalibrated attenuator 7, serving for compensa-
tion of the total energy losses in the upper part of the system (see Fig. l) in
the measurement elements 8 and 9. The reference signal and the signal arriving
from the receiving antenna, interfering with one another, give a standing wave
which is registered by the measurement line sonde. The signal arriving from the
measurement line sonde is amplified by an amplifier and is observed on an oscillo-

scope screen. After introducing the ice sample between the horns the wave phase
shift is determined by the displacement of the standing wave minimum in the meas-
urement line. Attenuation is-determined by the difference between the new and for-

mer readings of the precise measurement attenuator.

Since all the apparatus elements are fixed in position, it is somewhat more conven-
ient than an apparatus in which the phase change after introduction of the sample
between the horns is determined by the displacement of the horn [1].

Since in the apparatus employed the displacement of the standing wave minimum is
registered in the measurement line waveguide, and the movement of the sonde in
this case occurs simultaneously relative to the reference signal and the signal
propagating through the sample, the expression for the refractive index under the
condition of strong attenuation assumes the form

In addition, it is known that

Thus, using the measured values it is possible to compute any electric parameters
of the ice.

A test of the correctness of computation of n is unambiguity in determining the
minimum points in the measurement line with a change in sample thickness, re-
flecting the truth of the slope of the straight line 1: - f(d). Such an unambiguity
is realized only in a case when the change in thickness by the value Ad causes a
displacement of the minimum in the range AX . Awayeguide/ 2 (in this case AX - 2
cm). It follows from expression (9) that for fresh ice with n - 1.775Ad should be
not greater than 3.87 cm, whereas for sea ice with a possible anticipated value

n - 3 Ad should not exceed 1.35 cm. Thus, always selectingAd at about 1 cm, it
is possible to guarantee unambiguity in determining the phase shift caused by a
change in the thickness of the sample, and accordingly, unambiguity in determining
n within the limits of the indicated changes in its values.

Figure 2 shows the dependence of x and T on the thickness of three identical
samples extracted in the marginal part of the Bering Sea from a plate of gray ice.
The measurements were made at a temperature -9°C. Sample salinity was 6.620/00.

The results of the measurements coincide with an accuracy to *1: for n and with

an accuracy to :10: for N. The refractive index of ice and specific absorption,
computed from the straight lines in Pig. 2, are equal to 1.87 and 1.69 db/cm re-
spectively. For one of the samples, whose thickness varied each 5 mm, in the depen-
dence T - f(d) it is possible to trace a periodicity with a wavelength of 4 cm and

an amplitude of about 1 db. This periodicity is related to reflections in waveguide

channels and horn antenna systems which are difficult to take into account. It is
evident that the periodicity. if it is detected on the graph by means of measure-
ment of sample thickness with a small discreteness, exerts no influence on the
accuracy in measuring specific absorption, which is determined, as follows from

However, if the sample thickness is decreased by a 43d value greater than a quarter

specific absorption. In this case the relative error can be computed from the ex-

It can be seen from formula (13) that the error decreases with an increase in
sample thickness and "true. It is possible to estimate the possible errors which

may appear in such measurements. With a value “trued - 30 db (an attenuation at
which the signal minimum was registered quite reliably) 5 does not exceed :31. with

accuracy in reading on the measurement line rule is 0.01 mm, and the parallelism
of the sample surfaces when processed on a special coordinate instrument does not
exceed 1 mm, the relative error in determining the refractive index attains £11.

It is possible to estimate the specific absorption value for which the error in de-
termining 8' from expression (12) will not exceed a given value, such as 12. With

it is necessary to mention a favorable factor exerting an influence on the accuracy
in computing 8'. In the case of large "true values, as can be seen from expression
(13), the error in computing spectific absorption, and accordingly k, is small.
Therefore 5‘ is computed with sufficient accuracy. With small “true values

the k2 value is small and therefore its influence on the dielectric constant in
some cases can be neglected.

This measurement apparatus was used in determining the electric parameters of sea
ice during the Soviet-American "Bering" experiment. Similar apparatus can be fab-
ricated for investigations at other frequencies in the centimeter range and be
used not only for measuring the parameters of ice, but also the characteristics
of other materials with strong absorption.

[Article by I. K. Popov]

[Text] In the practice of use of acoustic methods and apparatus in investigations
of ocean areas covered by ice in many cases it is necessary to employ hydroacoustic
converters embedded in the ice for the reception of acoustic oscillations from the
water medium. Such a necessity arises, for example, when measuring the depth of
water bodies through the ice cover or in the registry of seismoacoustic noise from
sources situated at a considerable distance from the reception point when the waves,
propagating directly into the ice in the acoustic frequency range, attenuate.

Such investigations have demonstrated that acoustic converters, which in a water
medium within the limits of the acoustic frequency range are nondirectional, when
embedded in the ice exhibit directional properties relative to the oscillations
arriving from the water medium. An analysis of this phenomenon indicates that this
can be attributed to the conditions for sound propagation under the ice and the
acoustic characteristics of transition of sound from water into ice; the latter
factor, having an angular dependence, plays the decisive role. In addition, depend-
ing on the frequency of the registered oscillations, the ice cover plays the role
of a sort of plate, a layer of finite thickness or a semi-infinite medium.

In the central part of the Arctic basin, the thickness of the perennial ice on
which most of the seismoacoustic investigations are made from the drifting sta-
tions averages 3 m. Such ice can be considered a thin plate with elastic oscilla-
tions having frequencies not greater than 20-30 Hz, that is, in the subsonic region.

At these frequencies for a plate lying on an elastic half-specs flexure is the only
possible type of deformation. With such a representation of the ice cover its in-
fluence on the nature of reflection of elastic waves arriving from the water medi-
um is manifested as a second-order effect [1]: the reflection coefficient for a
plane wave in absolute value is close to unity and its phase differs little from
theﬂl value which it would have in the case of a free surface of the fluid.

In such situations it is possible to regard an acoustic detector embedded in the
ice as a converter situated within an infinite screen. The influence of an ice
layer situated between the converter and water at low frequencies, as a result of

35

small attenuation, can be neglected. The directivity characteristics of the con-
verter operating in an infinite screen is determined by the following expression:

2!. ( j!- xln a)
R” - Id '

—l- Sill 0

211 is a Bessel function of the first kind, of the first order; d is the diameter
of the converter.

(1)

The directivity of such a system begins to be reflected at frequencies correspond-
ing to the expression d/7\ . 1/2.

Taking into accOunt the real dimensions of the used converters (rv150 run their di-
rcctivity begins to be manifested from a frequency of about 5 KHz. Thus, in the
subsonic region the converters embedded in the ice are virtually nondirectional.
with an increase in the frequency of the registered oscillations of the ice cover
the latter no longer can be regarded as a thin plate. In addition, with an in-
crease in frequency there is an increase in the attenuation of sound in the ice.
As a result, at frequencies of about 1 KB: and above the ice for all practical
purposes can be regarded as a semi-infinite medium. In order to obtain the energy
ratios for the transition of acoustic waves from the fluid to the solid medium

the author of [3] introduces the concept of input resistance of the solid medium
with the incidence of a plane wave of a fluid on it at the arbitrary angle 690. It
is expressed by the following relationship:

[T " solid] 3' '--ZC08""29 I-tsln’Qll, (2)

where 2 ' Pea/cos 9, 5 - [oer/c038 are the wave resistances of the solid medium
for longitudinal and transverse waves respectively; cd, or are the velocities of
longitudinal and transverse waves; 9 and '3 are the refraction angles for longitud-
inal and transverse waves with an angle of incidence from the fluid 6 0-

Expression (2) is reduced to the form

- . ff-L.
" 'cmﬂ k"

(3)
I!
k, .1 - slu’2ﬂ(I-- kg).

lt follows from formula (3) that the angular characteristic of the input resistance
of the solid medium is dependent only on the "stiffness" of the solid medium and
in the limits of the angles sin 6‘ 0.9, that is, the value of the angle of total in-
ternal reflection for longitudinal waves retains almost constant since the increase
in zsolid due to a decrease in case in the denominator is compensated by approxim-

ately the same decrease in the ksolid coefficient. The sharp dropoff in the input
resistance is attributable to the fact that the correction

is dictated by the effect of shear waves. has a mazdmum at sin 6:: 0.8, after which
it decreases rapidly.

Thus, the input resistance of the ice cover for longitudinal and transverse waves
remains virtually unchanged up to the angle of total internal reflection for longi-

tudinal waves. after which it sharply increases. The angle of incidence £90 at
which the total internal reflection of longitudinal waves for ice is observed ac-
cording to computations is 30-32', depending on the properties of the ice associat-
ed with its formation. Accordingly, a detector embedded in the ice seemingly has

a directivity characteristic having an aperture angle of approximately 60-65° rela-
tive to the signals arriving from the water. 0n the other hand, source [2] gives
computed data on the angular dependence of the coefficient of reflection of sound
from the water-ice discontinuity for ice with values of the velocity of elastic
waves in the ice from 2-105 to 3.7-10s cm/sec. These show that the coefficient of
reflection at the water—ice discontinuity becomes close to l with angles of incid-
ence from 22-40 to 90°, dependent on the elastic properties of the ice and its
density. It follows from these data that the directivity of the embedded detectors
is 45-90.. ‘6 db

tions transmitted into ice from water.

At frequencies of the order of tens and hundreds of Hz the ice cover plays the role
of a layer of finite thickness with the transmission of acoustic waves into it

from the water medium. The wave pattern in this case is considerably complicated.
Taking into account the insignificant attenuation of sound in the ice at these
frequencies, it can be postulated that during the reception of signals in the ice

37

IND! OWWNCJAI.IEHECH'LV

standing waves will develop in its thickness with a distribution of amplitudes
changing with frequency. In this case in the reception of oscillations from the
water the depth to which the detector is embedded in the thickness of the ice
cover can be extremely important. In this case it is entirely possible that it
is desirable that the detector not be embedded in the ice but that it be placed,
for example, in a vertical opening made in the ice and filled with a nonfreesing
solution and by its movement in this opening a aaximum value of the amplitude

of the received oscillations be achieved.

The experimental checking of the conditions for the reception of oscillations from
the water by detectors embedded in the ice was carried out at the "Severnyy Polyne-
15" drifting station simultaneously with study of sound attenuation in ice. A detec-
tor enbedded in the ice to a depth of about 1 m registered signals from a sound
source placed first in the ice layer and then in the water. The sound source pres-
ent in the water moved in the horizontal plane at a depth of 10 m at the lover sur-
face of ice, whose thickness at the observation point was 2.8 m. The signals from
the sound source were registered simultaneously by a detector embedded in the ice
and a detector situated in the water directly under the lower surface of the ice
and on the same vertical with the first. The sound source was moved horizontally
for a distance up to 150 m from the site of the detectors. Curves of the dropoff
of signals registered by both detectors made it possible to determine the angular
dependence of the levels registered by the detector in the ice (Fig. 1).

Figure 2 shows the computed (on the basis of experimental data) angular character-
istic of response for a detector in the ice at a frequency of 3 [(112, taking into
account the dropoff of the signal in the water due to divergence of the wave front
in conformity to a spherical law. The directivity characteristic at a frequency

of 8 K32. judging from the curves of signal dropoff, differs little from that cited
in Fig. 2, but at a frequency of 12 no the angle characterizing the directivity
will be somewhat more acute. '

Thus, the experimental results indicate that the directivity of an acoustic detec-
tor embedded in the ice has a broader maximum than follows from the computed data.
The angle of aperture of this characteristic at a frequency of several 1le is 125-

140°. This is evidently attributable to the fact that in the computations no allow-
ance was made for the unevenness of the lower ice surface, due to which the sound

penetrates into the ice with angles of incidence greater than the computed values.
It is known that in the case of propagation under the ice the energy of the acoustic
field is concentrated in the near-ice water layer and the angles of emergence of
rays experiencing total internal reflection are up to 10°. Accordingly, it must

be expected that with detectors embedded in the ice it is difficult to register
sources situated at distances greater than one cycle of the boundary ray, that is.
at distances of more than ten kilometers, because the acoustic energy propagating
along rays close to boundary rays and having the least attenuation with distance

virtually does not penetrate into the ice.

[Text] One of the highly promising methods for obtaining complete information on
the stressed state of ice is based on the use of the Doppler effect in lasers. The
merit of this method, in particular, is that it makes it possible to carry out
continuous registry of the rates of relative movement of different points (sectors)
of the ice cover and thereby determine the deformation and its temporal change. In
comparison with others this method has a considerably greater dynamic range, a
better resolution, and makes it possible to register the rate of change of deform-
ation from values of about 1er/sec or more.

In this article we examine some results of testing of a method for experimental de-

termination of dynamic stresses in the ice using a Doppler laser system. The ex-
periment was carried out on the ice of Lake Ladogs in April 1972. The thickness
of the ice was 70 cm; the air temperature was from -2 to -3°C. The idea of the ex-

periment for determining deformation of the ice cover and its temporal changes in-

volved measurement of the difference frequency of the beats arising as a result of
interaction of the radiation reflected from the moving object and the direct laser

radiation.

The principal element of the measuring apparatus was a laser (type ORG-13) whose
divergence angle was 1.2-10"3 rad. The radiation from one of the ends of the laser

was directed on a mirror mounted at a distance of 0.5 m directly on the ice cover.

An PRU-36 photomultiplier was connected to the second end of the laser; it was sen-
sitive to the radiation range 3000 A-6000 A. There was an interference filter at

X - 6328 A for eliminating background radiation having a transmission band 25 A.
The light beats discriminated by the P20 were amplified by a wide-band amplifier
and through a cathode repeater were registered by a loop oscillograph (type 8-105).
The reflection coefficient for the reflection mirror with a silver coating was

962.

The entire apparatus operated as a laser deformograph in an ice sector 0.5 m. With-
out being inferior in response to seismic apparatus, the laser deformograph is a
wider-band instrument which makes it possible to register aperiodic displacements

and oscillations of the ice cover in a very broad frequency range.

 

Fig. 1. Diagram of experiment for determining dynamic stresses in ice. 1) floe;
2) ice cover; 3) reflection mirror.

For our purposes the laser must operate in a single-frequency regime. There must
be a brief frequency stability during the time of propagation of radiation to the
reflector and back, that is, during the time t . 300/3-10110 - 10-8 sec. During
this time the frequency must not change by more than 12 from the postulated Dop-
pler shift, that is, 10'3 Hz.

The stresses in the measured sector 1 (Fig. l) of the ice cover were created in the
following way. In an ice hole (measuring 2 x b m) there was a floating floe which
was brought into movement at different rates in the direction indicated by the

arrow. With impact of the flee on the ice cover a stress and a corresponding
deformation arise in it. On the oscillogram of the impact process and the pheno-
nena accompanying it there was time scanning of the Doppler frequency, which was
proportional to the rate of movement of the mirror and the laser, that is, to the
temporal rate of deformation. Thus, if it is assumed that the ice under experi-
mental conditions behaves as an elastic body. the stress in the ice can be esti-
mated in the following way.

From the expression for the Doppler frequency Alf'we determine the velocity v of
ice particles with transmission of a voltage pulse caused by impact of the floe,

After processing the impact oscillogram we obtained a graph of the curve of change
of [if with time (Fig. 2). An analysis of the oscillogram reveals that initially
our measurement system registers natural oscillations of the ice. The system re-
acts only to horizontal compressions and dilatations. Vertical displacements exert
an influence only on the intensity of the light ray incident on the photodetector.
Evidently, to some degree the registered signal could also be influenced by vibra-
tion of the connecting hoses between individual units of the measurement complex
arising despite the measures undertaken for eliminating the influence of the wind
on the entire system, which was situated partially on the ice and partially in the

The rate at which the natural (background) displacements of ice particles occurs
is approximately 2.5-20}L/sec. The corresponding frequencies of the natural oscil-
lations of the ice cover are approximately 1-10 Hz. At the time to of impact the
velocity increases sharply and then changes in conformity to the curve (see Fig.

2).

Such a dependence of the rate of displacement indicates the following mechanism
of propagation of an elastic wave in the ice. Initially the reflection mirror be-
gins to move toward the laser. Then another wave reaches the laser and it. like
the reflector, moves in one direction, as a result of which there is a subsequent
decrease in velocity. Again the registered increase in the velocity indicates that
the reflector begins to move in the opposite direction from the laser. The same
nature of change in the relative velocity of movement of the ice particles in the
measured sector with the length l was also observed on the remaining oscillograms

of floe impacts.

We will determine the stress in the ice cover operative, for example. in the first

In evaluating the stresses in the ice in an impact produced by a different method
from the measured values of the mass of the impact body, its velocity at the time
of impact, the area of contact and impact time, it was possible to o tain compar-
able results differing from the computed value 0‘ by about 0.5 kg/cm .

For a more correct approach to determination of stresses in the ice by the proposed
method it is desirable to know the real rheological properties of the ice, which
usually are not described by a linear dependence between stress and strain.

[Article by A. V. Gusev and A. P. Polyakov]

[Text] In a study of microstructure of the sea medium measurements are made of its
mean temperature, mean velocity, temperature fluctuations and fluctuations of flow
velocity. Recently there has been a tendency to the use of low-inertia thermoanemo-
metric sensors in measurements. These make it possible to register the change in
the studied parameters with frequencies up to 20 Hz and amplitudes up to 0.05 mm/
sec [1, 3]. However, thermistor-type sensors react to oscillatory motion and some-
times are used in registering the movements of measurement elements [2]. There-
fore. the possible oscillations of the measurement system will be interference

in the investigations. This article is devoted to the problems involved in the ex-
citation of oscillations of some elements of measurement systems in flows and ex-
perimental investigation of these oscillations.

In studying the spatial characteristics of flow velocity and its pulsations it is
customary to employ spatially separated systems of sensors. This spacing is accom-
plished by a distribution of the sensors along submerged electric or supporting
cables or also on three-dimensional supporting frames of different configuration.
The setting-out of these measurement systems is accomplished using supporting or
electrical cables and bottom anchors and sunken floats in open seas and with lower-
ing of the systems from the ice in arctic seas. The placement of the instruments

at shallow depths is accomplished from the ice using rigid tubular rods.

In the presence of currents these submerged systems are all subjected to hydrody-
namic pressures. With flow around any cylindrical body a dead space is formed in
the flow behind it in which the water is at rest, that is, does not experience
translational motion in the direction of the flow. In the boundary layer between
the moving medium and the medium at rest shearing forces arise which are caused by
viscosity of the medium. These forces give rise to a rotational movement in the

medium at rest, leading to the formation of two symmetrically arranged nuclei of
eddies which develop at the expense of one another due to a small initial asym-
metry.

We will examine the eddy excitation of pulsations of different mechanical oscilla-
tory systems. As a result of collapse of the eddies pressure impulses are created
which act perpendicularly to the flow direction. In the eddy formation process

there is formation of a periodic induced force capable of bringing the particular .
oscillatory system to its normal mode. At the present time, taking into account the
role of eddy formation in the excitation of oscillations, it is assumed [5] that
there is also a feedback. involving an influence of the oscillatory notion of the
system on the process of formation and collapse of eddies. Thus. this phenomenon
must not be regarded as an induced oscillation, but as an autooscillation. Fro: this
point of view excitation at the normal mode is completely understandable. A definite
number of standing waves is induced in a flexible electrical or supporting cable.
The frequency of the oscillations and the length of the oscillating segments of
cable can be determined approximately using the Strouhal formula and the string

equation respectively:
‘ a- ] 'I D . "-a ‘ —
$.'---&—. I... 7— " l‘ , (1)

where V is flow velocity; d is cable diameter; f. is the eddy collapse frequency; T
is cable tension;}}a is linear density of the cable; f0 is the frequency of charac-
teristic oscillations; 1 is the length of a half-wave of oscillations.

The dimensionless Strouhal number St is dependent on the Reynolds number and is ap-
proximately 0.2 for Reynolds numbers 300<R<100 000. The frequency f3 is dependent
on the flow velocity (linearly), the frequency of cable oscillations is dependent
on the ratio of f0 to £3 since the oscillations develop most intensively when there
is an equality of these frequencies or at higher harmonics of oscillations of the
system. Accordingly. the frequency of oscillations of the cable changes discretely
from one form of oscillations to another; nevertheless. the mean frequency of the
vibrations is almost linearly dependent on water velocity. when under the influ-
ence of static forces the cable slopes relative to the flow it is necessary to take
its component in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the cable as the velo-
city determining the frequency of eddy collapse.

0n the basis of expression (1), with small submergences of the systems and with
small flow velocities it is possible to select such parameters of these systems
with which there will be no excitation of vibrations. However, in actual practice
this will not always be justified and in addition there are excitations of oscilla—
tions even in the case of laminar flow around bodies, that is, when the Reynolds
number is less than 50. This suggests that in addition to the well-known mechanism
of excitation of vibrations by the flow during eddy formation there is also another
mechanism for the development of forces leading to the excitation of oscillations

also in the case of small Reynolds numbers.

We will examine the behavior of a circular elastic cylinder in the flow. With a uni-
form movement of the cylinder in unbounded space of a nonviscous fluid the velocity

at points on a cylinder is equal to [b]:

v 2szInH, (2)

and the pressure distribution along the cylinder in the plane perpendicular to the
axis is determined by the pressure coefficient

I_"‘~-l ‘(TE-rr-J- -4sln’9. (3)

For the lower half of the cylinder the V and 3' values are identical at points sym-
metric relative to x and y. Accordingly, the projection of the hydrodynamic reac~
tlon onto the x-axis (direction of movement) Rx, called drag, and also the pro-
jection onto the direction Ry perpendicular to movement, called lift, are identical-
ly equal to zero, which under real conditions is not observed. The reason for the
development of the forces acting on the cylinder from the direction of the flow
must be sought in the rejection of _assumptions that the fluid is unbounded, that

it is nonviscous and that there is a constancy of velocity.

We will examine the circulatory flow around a circular cylinder. He will superpose
on noncirculatory flow around a cylinder a circulatory flow with a singularity
(center of eddy) at the center of the cylinder. The characteristic function of
this complex flow is expressed by the formula

W V__.(z I 'f) |- iii-m2. (6)

where r- V d? is the velocity circulation; z - x + iy; r0 is the cylinder radius.

Assuming that the velocity of the circulatory flow V in polar coordinates at any
point of the fluid is equal to r [21“ [lo], we obtain the velocity at the cylin-
der surface in the form of the sum of the velocity of flow around a cylinder with-
out circulation and the velocity of the circulatory flow

For the latter case, using formula (5), we find that the velocity at points on

we find that p w r<:pup er' that is, pressure at symmetric points on the lower
part of the cylinder is less than on the upper part. These pressures, summed over
the surface of the cylinder, lead to the appearance of lift Ry which will be equal
to

where I is the generatrix of a cylinder of a unit height.

Accordingly, on any rotating cylinder with its relative movement in the fluid there
will he a lift force operative which is proportional to the density of the fluid,
velocity of the oncoming flow and circulation. The intensity of this force is pro-
portional to the diameter of the cylinder. Under its influence the relative velo-
city of the body will experience changes in time with respect to both value and
direction, that is, V - V(x,y,z,t). Problems related to unsteady movement of bod-
ies in a fluid can be considered only in a case when the coordinate system moves
together with the body. Solving these problems [6], we obtain an expression for
drag in general form

where mapp is the apparent mass of fluid.
The lift will displace the cylinder from a state of equilibrium and with the striv-
ing of the cylinder to occupy the most stable position there can be development of

periodic oscillations in the direction across the flow. As a simplification we will
assume that the oscillations are sinusoidal, that is, the velocity is equal to

Vy sincdt. Then the total velocity of the cylinder V will be
V‘ Vi-I Visllluf.

The expression for acceleration includes the term sin 2¢Jt, that is, the force act-
ing on the body in the direction along the flow will be periodic and its frequency
will exceed by a factor of 2 the frequency of the possible transverse oscilla-
tions.

With the submergence of the measurement systems from the surface weights are sus-
pended to them; when they are installed on the bottom there are floats for ensuring
tension of the cable and maintaining it in a vertical position, and also for de-
creasing the tilts of the instrument in the presence of currents. Depending on the

relationship of the tensile stresses and weight of the electrical or supporting
cable the systems will have different vibrational properties. If the tensile stress
due to the weight or buoyancy greatly exceeds the weight of the cable the system

will be similar in its oscillation parameters to a string and the expression for
the possible oscillations of the system with its displacement from a state of
equilibrium has the form

Ila
y=AslnT x, (12)

where A are arbitrary constants. determined from the boundary conditions; I is
the length of the Suspension.

As a simplification we will examine the oscillations in only one plane. The origin
of coordinates is matched with the end of the suspension and the x—axis is directed
along the line of the "fiber." with a predominance of the weight of the cable over
the weight of the weight the system oscillations are similar to the oscillations of
a fiber with a distributed weight and are determined by the expression

y, , Act—1,42“ y?) (13)

where 10 is a Bessel function of the first kind of a zero order; g is the accelera-
tion of free falling.

An analysis of expressions (12) and (13) shows that a system similar to a string in
an ideal case at its end does not have movements along the y-axis. However, a fiber
with a distributed weight always has at its end a maximum amplitude of the displace-
ments along the y-axis which is transmitted to the measuring instruments attached

to the electrical or supporting cable at this place.

It follows from this analysis that in order to reduce the vibrations in the measure-
ment systems in the flow it is necessary to decrease the diameters of the extended
cylindrical elements of the systems, damp the rotational motion of these elements,
strive to impart to the suspension system the vibrational properties of the string
and ensure the independent collapse of the eddies along the extended elements of the
system.

The experimental investigations of the vibrations of submerged systems arising in

a flow were made using three-component vibrosensors. A vibrosensor was placed at
the end of the submerged system in such a way that the response to vibrations in
the vertical direction was 0.4 Big, in two mutually perpendicular directions in the
horizontal plane - 1.8 B/g. A stabilizer is placed on the housing of the vibrosen-
ear in order to ensure its orientation relative to the direction of flow.

The results of the experimental investigations confirmed that the vibration in the

direction perpendicular to the direction of flow is most intense. It exceeds the
longitudinal and vertical oscillations by an order of magnitude. Figure 1 shows

the spectral characteristics of the oscillatory velocity in the transverse, long-
itudinal and vertical directions of the end of a cable with a diameter of 14 mm

and a length of 20 m with a spherical weight at the end of 15 kg with a velocity

of flow 7 cm/sec. The dashed sloping lines represent levels of equal displacements
A. The values of the displacements and oscillatory velocity in Pig. 1 are given in
real values, but for obtaining their amplitude values it is necessary that they be

multiplied by 1.61.

The oscillatory velocity of transverse vibrations in this case considerably ex:
ceeds the longitudinal and vertical oscillations. Since the longitudinal and
vertical oscillations are a result of transverse oscillations, whose intensity
considerably predominates, in the study of vibrations of submerged systems it is
only necessary to register the latter. This made it possible, in a study of os-
cillations, to use thereafter a sensor in the form of a ceramic transducer having
a spherical configuration and an identical response to vibrations in all direc-
tions, which does noc require its orientation in the flow.

Although the most intense oscillations are excited with an equality of f0 and f3,
with an increase in flow velocity there is a tendency to a linear increase in the
frequency of the excited oscillations. Figure 2 shows the spectral densities of
the oscillatory velocity of different suspension systems with a flow velocity of
10 cm/sec. A comparison of the oscillatory velocities of different systems shows
that at some frequencies they differ by more than a factor of 1000. It is confirm-
ed that a system similar to a string is more noise immune to vibrations than a
fiber with a distributed weight.

Stabilizers with a weight and vanes.on a cable impede the development of torsional
oscillations of the system and vibrations, and also damp the system oscillations
appearing due to eddy collapse.

The results of the experimental data also confirm that with an increase in the dia-
meter of the cables there is an increase in the intensity of the oscillations

(see Figures 1 and 2). Accordingly, even with relatively small current velocities
the oscillatory velocity of individual parts of the suspension systems can attain
large values (tens of millimeters per second). It is entirely natural that with

the use of sensors reacting to oscillatory motion the hydrodynamic vibrations of
the suspension systems will create high noise levels which limit the range of
measurement of the registered values and in the absence of control can be erron-
eously considered to be the studied process.

Thus, on the basis of a theoretical analysis and experimental data the following
was established:

1. During the study of the microstructure of the sea medium by sensors submerged
on cables and rigid rods when currents are present there can be hydro-echanical
vibrations of the submerged system which are detectable by sensors responsive to

movement 0

2. If special measures are not taken for the damping of oscillations, the oscilla-
tory velocities can attain tens of millimeters per second even with relatively low
current velocities (up to 10 cm/sec).

3.‘ﬂhen making such measurements it is necessary to monitor the oscillations of the
suspension system by vibrodetectors at the places where sensors are attached.

4. In order to ensure the maximum noise immunity of submerged systems to vibrations
an effort must be made to exclude rotations of elements of the system about its
axis, decrease the diameters of the cables, have independent cutoff of the eddies

along the length of extended elements of the system (such as electrical and support-
ing cables), and also create a means for damping of the developing oscillations.

[Text] Remote thermal mapping on the basis of its characteristic infrared (IR) ra-
diation is possible by employing IR apparatus situated on any moving carrier: air-
craft, surface transport, ship, etc. It goes without saying in each specific case
there will be definite peculiarities in the IR survey of a feature. It was of in-
terest to study the possibility of using this apparatus on a ship because there

is no information on the operation of IR scanning systeas on ships. Earlier such
IR apparatus successfully underwent aircraft tests in the Arctic, as a result of
which a great mass of thermal data was obtained on the state of the sea surface
covered with ice and concerning island glaciers [2].

An IR survey of the ocean surface was included in the work program of the radiophys-
ics detachment of the scientific research ship "Professor Vize," which constituted
part of the Sixteenth Soviet Antarctic Expedition. The laboratory was situated on
the bridge deck on the ship's port side. The optical unit was set on a support
attached to the deck and supplied with a rotating element which made it possible

to select the optimum angle for scanning the investigated surface. Alongside the

optical unit there was an aerial camera for the synchronous surveying of the exam-
ined surface. The scanning was carried out perpendicular to the direction of move-

ment of the ship.

An IR survey of the ocean surface was made in the Strait of Magellan during the
ship's run to Bellinsgauzen Station, and also in regions of floating ice and ice-
bergs. ‘

Figure 1,a shows a typical picture of the brightness contrasts of a sector of the
water-ice surface. During operation the apparatus was adjusted in such a way that
the colder sectors of the examined surface corresponded to a lighter tone of the
photograph. Thus, water shows up as a dark background against which the ice can be
seen in a gray-white tone. The presence of tone gradations is indicative of a dif-
ferent thickness of the ice. In general, the IR maps of ti e water-ice surface of
the ocean obtained in work from the ship do not contain new information in compar—
ison with the results obtained in the Kara Sea and are inferior to the: in quality.

The setting up of the IR outfit optical unit at an angle to the scanned surface,
rolling of the ship and nonuniformity of the rate of its movement cause apprec-
iable distortions of the image.

A study was also made of the possibility of determining the state of the ocean sur-
face using data from an IR survey. Figure 1,b shows an IR photograph of the wave-
covered water surface. It is easy to .ee waves and the direction of movement of the
waves, which confirms the assumption of the existence of brightness contrasts of the
wave—covered ocean surface. The appearance of these contrasts when waves are present
can be attributed, on the one hand, to temperature nonuniformity of the water sur-
face as a result of intensive mixing. The lower limit of the temperature inhomogen—
eity, characterizing the thermal contrasts registered by the IR apparatus, is de-
termined by the minimum temperature contrasts (ﬁsTmin) detectable by the IR appar-
atus. With a water temperature at the time of the survey 20°C l3Tmin - 0.06'. On

the other hand, when waves are present there is a change in the emission character—
istics of the water Surface, that is. the dependence of water emissivity on sight-
ing angle is clearly expressed.

A negative result obtained in an attempt to determine the pattern of temperature
contrasts of the thermal field of an iceberg is interesting. It was found that
the 1R scanning apparatus does not detect an iceberg against a sky background. The

53

lroherg was clearly visible on the photograph taken with an aerial camera. The

in map shows only the sky-ocean surface contrast and the iceberg cannot be dis-
tinguished. A reason for such a phenomenon can be postulated. As is well known, an
object can be detected only in a case when its emission differs from the background
emission. Since the IR radiation of an object is a function of its temperature and
emissivity, it is obvious that the object and the background will be distinguished
either under the condition of an inequality of their temperatures or with an iden-
tical temperature, but different emission coefficients. However, there can be such
a combination of emissivities and temperatures of the object and its surroundings

with which the radiation of the object is equal to the radiation of the background
and there will be no brightness gradations on the photograph.

Due to malfunctioning of the apparatus it was not possible to obtain the pattern of
thermal contrasts of the ocean surface in the convergence region. However, here the
temperature of the water surface was measured with a radiation thermometer, which
was also provided for by the work program of the radiophysical detachment. Earlier
the radiation thermometer was used successfully in the Arctic [1.3]. Figure 2 shows
the change in water temperature measured with a radiation thermometer and a resis-
tance thermometer on a profile along the 20th meridian (in the convergence zone).

In both cases the temperature jump moment is clearly expressed. The discrepancy in
the readings of the thermometers is entirely understandable since the radiation

thermometer measures the temperature of the water surface (the thickness of the

layer forming the IR radiation in the range 8-12tbm is several tens of micrometers)
whereas the sensor of the resistance thermometer is at a depth of 5 m.

In conclusion it should be noted that the collected experimental data confirm the
possibility of remote thermal mapping of the water-ice surface from aboard a ship.
Despite some shortcomings. complicating the collection of qualitative thermal in-
formation under shipboard conditions, the IR apparatus on ships can be used in
solving a number of problems in oceanology. We feel that it is possible to use
these systems for studying the thermal structure of the water surface in zones

of convergence (divergence), clusters of icebergs. currents and the coastal run-
off of rivers both for the detection of these nonuniformities and for ascertaining
the limits and extent of temperature anomalies. Evidently, such studies will re-
quire more detailed study of the possibilities of TV apparatus for investigation
of thermal fields with a small temperature gradient, for example, in evaluating
the degree of influence of disturbances of the characteristic radiation caused by
waves on the detection of the thermal structure of the investigated objects.

[Text] An analysis of the results of an infrared (IR) survey of the water-ice sea
surface [2] indicates that its thermal map includes information on the relation-
ship of ice cover thicknesses. It is known that the distinguishability of objects
on the thermal map is determined both by their temperature differential and by the
different emissivity. If as a first approximation the emissivity of the investig-
ated ice surface is considered homogeneous, the brightness contrasts on an IR photo-
graph will be attributable to the temperature inhomogeneities of the ice surface.
The difference in temperature of the ice surface, all other conditions being
equal, will be dependent on the ice thickness and the relationship of air temper-
ature and the heat influx from the water. Under natural conditions the ice is al-
most always covered with a layer of snow. The snow layer, a poor conductor of
heat, on the ice surface will exert a screening influence on the detection of its
temperature contrasts (and accordingly, also its changes in the ice thickness)

and with certain definite thicknesses can completely distort the thermal pattern.

In the winter of 1973 work was carried out on Lake Ladoga for the purpose of de-
tecting the possibility of remote estimation of the thickness of the snow cover

on the ice (sail). Such an experiment is of interest for clarifying the screening
influence of the snow on the ice surface on determination of the age stages of
ice. In addition, the possibility of remote determination of the thickness of the
snow cover is important for estimating the moisture reserve. The measurements were
made in an area corresponding to the scanning strip of the IR scanning apparatus

whose optical unit was situated at a height of 3 m from the investigated surface.
The IR apparatus successively examined the surface of rocks, water, ice and snow
cover (on the ice) of different thickness. The signal was registered by an ampli-
tude indicator (SI-20 oscillograph). At the same time measurements were made of the
temperature of the underlying surface by a contact method (MT-54 resistance ther-
mometers cut into a bridge circuit). The signal was registered at different times of
day under different meteorological conditions.

Figure 1 shows that change of the signal is easily traced in a successive examin-
ation of the snow cover on the ice, sectors of ice of different thickness and the
surface of rock having a nonidentical temperature (and emissivity). The amplitudes

of signals from snow levels of different thickness lying on a homogeneous ice
sector are clearly distinguishable. A signal from a snow layer of greater thickness,
having a lower temperature, is stronger. A thin snow cover on ice with a thick-
ness of 7 cm is perceived as warmer.

 

Fig. 1. One of variants of investigated surface (a) and corresponding signals on
oscillograph screen (b).

In the course of the work we noted the following:

1. with a decrease in air temperature the registered thermal contrasts of the snow

levels increase; this increase is especially conspicuous in the case of small
Snow thicknesses. These results agree with the computational dependence obtained

by Yu. P. Doronin for the relationship between temperature of the snow surface
and air temperature and different thicknesses of snow and ice [1].

2. An increase in air temperature leads to a smoothing of the thermal contrasts
of the snow cover. With air temperatures close to zero the snow levels were not
distinguishable with the IR apparatus. On the other hand, with a decrease in pos-
itive air temperature (without passing through zero) the contrasts in thicknesses
of the snow cover could be registered. An inversion was observed: in the IR sur-
vey the thicker snow layers were perceived as warmer.

3. The influence of solar radiation, which directly heats the snow cover surface
and makes an IR contribution to the radiation detected by the IR apparatus, was

Substantial. The resulting pattern of thermal contrasts in this case is consider-
ably distorted.

In addition to plotting of the thermal map by the scanning IR apparatus there was
registry of the temperature of the investigated surface by use of a PRT-S radiation
thermometer (produced by the Barnes Engineering Company, United States). In a
rock-snow level sector the radiation temperature for the rock was the principal
source of information on the relationship of the thermal contrasts of the snow
cover. This sector was at the boundary of the scanning strip of the IR apparatus
and therefore the registered signal was distorted. As indicated by measurements
with the PRT-S, the thermal contrasts of the snow levels on the rock and ice with
similar thicknesses of the snow cover were not identical. The snow on the rock is
perceived as being colder.

The collected experimental data make it possible to conclude that there is a pos-
sihility for remote determination of the thickness of the snow cover by the IR
method, but in this process it is necessary to evaluate the limits of applicability
of the method. Evidently, the distinguishability of snow sectors of different thick-
ness will be determined by the thickness of the snow cover; by the relationship of
air temperature and temperature of the surface underlying the snow cover at the

time of measurements; by the preceding variation of temperatures; by the thermophys-
ical characteristics of the snow. Computations with'possible variants of the rela-
tionship of these factors are necessary.

[Article by Ye. A. Hartynova and V. A. Spitsyn]

[Text] The principal characteristics of the IR scanning apparatus developed at the
Arctic and Antarctic Scientific Research Institute and the possibilities of its

use for thermal mapping of snow-ice surfaces have already been examined in [2].
Being a system for transforming the received IR radiation into a visible image,
such an apparatus in principle makes it possible to measure the temperature of

the investigated features. It is possible to realize the possibility of simultan-
eous registry of temperature of the underlying surface and its thermal mapping

by introducing a special standard source whose radiation is compared with the radi-
ation of the investigated object. From this point of view the optical system of the
IR apparatus used earlier in experiments in the field of thermal mapping is opti-
mum because it makes it possible to locate the source of reference (standard) radi-
ation in such a way that the IR radiation of the investigated objects and the
standard source travel one and the same optical path.

As the sources of a standard level of radiation necessary for a changeover to meas-
urements of the temperatures of the investigated surfaces it is possible to use
models of an ideally black body (188) built into the optical unit or other methods
for obtaining a reference signal (for example, a method using the characteristic
thermal radiation of the cooled detectors of IR radiation). The possibility of us-
ing a cooled radiation detector as the reference source is determined by the fact
that the sensing element is at a constant temperature (in this case this is the
boiling point of liquid nitrogen). ‘

Now we will examine in greater detail the features of the IR apparatus reception
unit and methods for its calibration.

The oscillogram (Pig. l,a) makes it possible to determine the output voltages, pro-
portional to the following difference fluxes, which act on the IR radiation detec-
tor:

where (131“ is the flux from the corresponding 133 model; 4)“ . odet are the
fluxes from the investigated surface and the detector of IR radiation.

It therefore follows that with a known emissivity the temperature of the investigat-
ed surface can be determined by interpolation or extrapolation methods in a case
then in the field of view of the optical system there are two standard radiation

sources (for example, 1 and 2 in Fig. l,b), whose temperature is different and can
be measured.

However, the nonlinearity of the dependence between temperature and the radiation
flux, especially in the range of low temperatures, leads to substantial errors in
determining temperature.

Better results can be obtained if one of the following calibration curves is first
obtained:

Tsurf " f(A¢2) with 1.1331 - const; (7)
Tsurf ' f(4¢1,) with T1332 . const; (8)

In the first two cases the radiation of the 183 models is the reference radiation;
in the third the reference level is provided by the characteristic radiation of
the IR radiation detector (autocollimation case).

It is of interest to determine the most acceptable variant of calibration for the
IR apparatus. ‘

If expressions (2), (1c), (6) are written in greater detail, in each case taking
into account the position of the scanning mirror (see Fig. 1), after correspond-

ing transformations it is possible to obtain the following expressions character-
izing the difference fluxes operative on the detector of IR radiation ( $2; $4;

Using the expressions for the difference fluxes (10)-(12) and the tables published
by M. A. Bramson [1], the authors made computations for the purpose of determining
the influence of changes in temperature of the optical elements of the IR apparatus
on the difference flux as a function of the calibration method. The initial data
for the computations are given below:

Radiating object 1331 1832 IR radiation Optical Investigated
detector parts surface

Temperature of
object, °C 9 5 -33 -9, -1 -13

The reSults of the computations are given in Table l. The cited data show that the
difference fluxes, and accordingly the registered signal, are dependent on the tem-
perature of the optical parts of the IR apparatus receiving unit. It can be noted
that the minimum influence is exerted by a change in the temperature of the optical
system on the signal caused by the resultant flux

4‘92 ' q>113131 ‘ .01.:-

The difference fluxes A¢Q and4¢g corresponding to the use of 1882 and a detector
of their radiation (autocollimation method) as a measurement standard are approx-
imately identically subject to the influence of temperature instability of the
optical parts.

Accordingly, from the point of view of the nondependence of the registered signal
on the temperature of the optical parts of the IR apparatus it is preferable to
use in calibration the radiation of a model of an ideally black body 1331..

Now we will discuss the calibration method and method for subsequent temperature
measurements of the investigated surface; Taking the above recommendations into
account, our IR apparatus. which for the most part was intended for making observ-
ations from an aircraft, was supplied with a built-in IBB model situated in front
of the input element of the optical unit -— a scanning plane-parallel mirror. The
positioning of the standard source corresponds to the position of I331 in Pig. 1.
Due to the considerable size of the objective used in the optical unit, construct-
ed in a Cassegrainian scheme (diameter of entrance aperture 150 an», it is neces-
sary to use a model of an 133 with a large area of the entrance window. This con-

dition follows from the basic requirement on the design of the optical channel,
in which it is necessary to ensure a nondependence of the radiant flux at the in-
put of the IR radiation detector on the distance to the investigated surface [3].

62

FINI¢HH§C1A1.USE(”NLY
FOI1OFFHJAI.USE(MVLY

In other words, the 138 model must be an extended source whose surface always
overlaps the optical channel field of view.

The large size of the IDS model in turn complicates the temperature stabilization
process. The accuracy in maintaining this temperature at a stipulated level de-
termines the accuracy in measuring the temperature of the investigated objects.
The difficulties are also aggravated by the fact that in the design of the used
optical unit the "IR apparatus" is not protected from the atmospheric effects

of the entrance window. The absence of the protected entrance window, however,

in combination with a strongly ventilating rotating plane-parallel mirror5does not
make it possible to ensure an acceptable accuracy in maintaining the temperature
of the standard source during flights under changing climatic conditions. Accord-
ingly, it is desirable to desist completely from temperature stabilization of

the used 138 model. In this case the temperature of the investigated surfaces can
be determined in the following way: making use of temperature sensors, in the
course of measurements there is constant registry of the temperature of the 133
model, whereas the temperature of the investigated surface is ascertained from

an earlier plotted calibration curve corresponding to the range of temperature

changes of the 133 model (under measurement conditions) and the output signal
value.

Using this method plans call for obtaining a family of calibration curves whose
parameter is T133,

13“,. - fwd» - axon). (13)

where Tsurf is surface temperature3134Dis the registered difference of fluxes; U
is the output voltage; K is a proportionality factor.

Despite the fact that this calibration method seems simple, it is inconvenient
due to considerable expenditures of working time, also related to the need for
obtaining individual calibration curves for surfaces with different emissivity.

Therefore. when it is impossible to use the method for stabilization of a standard

source. for the calibration of a scanning IR apparatus it is proposed that use be
made of a simpler method in which two "extended" standard sources (138 models),

identical in their characteristics. must be used. One of these is built in to the

optical unit like the 1881 (see Fig. 1), whereas the other (1333) simulates the
radiation of the investigated surface.

In this case it is possible, quite simply, to obtain a single standardized calibra-
tion curve

TIBB - f(Ad>) - f(KU). (16)

In order to determine this dependence the output voltage value is read from the
amplitude recorder screen. This voltage corresponds to the difference in the radi-
ation fluxes of the used 133 models with a different IBB temperature simulating
the underlying surface. The 183 temperature of the IR apparatus installed in the
optical unit is maintained during calibration of the constant.

Figure 2 shows a variant of the calibration curve of the dependence of the output
voltage ”out of the IR apparatus on 188 temperature.

Pig. 2. Variant of calibration curve.

Under natural conditions, when a thermal survey is made from an aircraft, the radi-
ation temperature of the investigated object can be determined from the known tem-
perature of the 133 built into the optical unit and the amplitude of the signal
registered on the oscillogram corresponding to the difference in the Inn - invest-
igated object fluxes: using the calibration curve we find the 00 value correspond-
ing to a particular IBB temperature (see Fig. 2). Then, knowing that the tempera-
ture of the investigated surface is higher or lower than the 188 temperature (this
can be seen on the amplitude indicator screen), we ascertain from the Do value the
amplitude of the signal U1 and using the calibration curve we determine the sought-
for temperature of the object T1.

It should be emphasized that the condition of constancy of I331 temperature is not
necessary; it is only sufficient to know its value at the time of measurement of
temperature of the investigated object.

It is entirely understandable that by using the constructed calibration curve under
the real conditions of an IR survey it is possible to ascertain the radiation tem-
perature of the investigated object. However, conversion to thermodynamic tempera-
ture is possible if the emissivity coefficient is known for a given temperature

and the spectral range employed.
