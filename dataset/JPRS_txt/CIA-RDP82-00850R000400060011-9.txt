[Article by V. ShpektorOV, chief of Production Department at USSR Ptitseprom:
"Promoting the Development of Private Poultry Raising in Every Possible Vay"]

[Text] Public paultry raising in Our country is developing on an industrial basis
and this is making it possible to increase rapidly the production of goods and to
raise the efficiency of the branch. At the same time, an important source for
augmenting the rescurces of poultry raising products is that of raising paultry on
the private plots of kolkhoz members and manual and office employees. In 1980,
according to preliminary data, these plots produced 21.7 billion eggs and 1 million
tons of poultry meat, or 32 and 37.8 percent respectively of the overall production
volumes for these products at all categories of farms. The products obtained from
private plots serve as a substantial addition to the dining tables of their owners
and represent a considerable portion of such products sold at the kolkhoe markets
or procured by the state.

Recently. in connection with the great importance being attached to the further
development of private poultry raising, the specialized enterprises and IPS's
[incubator poultry-raising station] have been assigned annual tasks for selling
young poultry stock to the population. Coumnncing in 1980, this indicator has been
included in the national economic plan.

As e result of measures undertaken, the sale of young poultry stock to the
population has increased (see Table).

During the Tenth Five-Year Plan, the average annual sales volume for yoang poultry
stock sold to the population amounted to 692 million head. including 77 million head
of waterfowl and turkeys, or 39 and 52 percent more respectively than during the
Ninth Five-Year Plan. In all, 2.46 billion head of young poultry stock of all types
were sold to the population during the 1976-1980 period, or 684 million more head
than during the l97l-l975 period,

This task is being solved most successfully in the Ukrainian 388. During the Tenth
Five-Year Plan, the sale of young stock to the population increased by 40 percent,
with 8.8 head being sold per rural resident during 1980. This was achieved mainly
as a result of purposeful work carried out by the republic's interkolkhos IPs's.
Last year, they supplied 90 percent of the young stock made available to the private

Note. On the average for the country as a whole. 217,900 head of young
stock were sold by one farm to the population, by a farm of USSR

kolkhos (interkolkhoz) IFS -- 262,100 head.

 

plots. Thus the specialised fares of the republic’s Ptitsepron are not devoting
proper attention to this problem. After incubating considerably more eggs than the
interkolkhoz IPS's, they sold aluoet ten times less young stock to the population.

During 1980, for the country as a whole, the IPS's accounted for 61.4 percent of the
y0ung stock sold to satisfy the requirements of the private plots. In all, they
sold 350.5 million head to this group of farms. In the [1588 the portion contributed
by the IPS's was 80 percent and in the A2883 end USSR -- 70 percent.

In connection with the sale of young stock to the population, good indicators were
achieved in the ArSSR -- 7.6 head,end in the HSSR -- 6.8 head on the average for
each rural resident. This indicator also increased noticeably in the Russian
Federation ~- by 1.6 times and it reached an average of 6.7 head. However, it
fluctuates sharply for individual trays and oblaets.

As yet. very few young stock are being sold to the populations in the Lassa and

ESSR -- 2.7 head in each, or in the 8883 -- 2.1 head. The situation is especially
bad in the TuSSR, TISSR and 02883. where during 1980 only 1.1, 0.9 and 0.7 head of
young stock respectively were sold pertindividuel rural resident. Deserving of
mention is the fact that in the HSSR, where 6.8 head were sold to the population and
in the GSSR -- 5.1 head, this indicator remains practically at the same level as that
for 197:. And indeed it is in these republics. just as in other s0utharn regions of
the country, that the most favorable natural-climatic conditions are found for the
development of poultry raising on private plots.

Recently, an increase has taken place in the sale of young waterfowl and turkeys to
the population. However. for the country as a whole, the proportion of such sales
compared to the overall volume of poultry sales during 1980 amounted to only 18.6
percent. Very few ducklings, goslings and yOung turkeys are being sold to the
population in the AzSSR, ArSSR and 02888 and in the USSR two times less poultry of
these types were sold last year coupered to the previous year.

We are still encountering incidents of the purchasers having to stand on line at the

gates of the poultry factories or IPS's in order to procure young stock. In some
areas it has even become a problem to purchase day-old chicks of egg-laying strains.
In the case of meat strains of chicks, ducklings, goslings and young turkeys, almost
nowhere are the requirements of the population for them being satisfied.

I would like to emphasize that the periods for selling these types of poultry to the
population can be expended considerably. The high level of rapid growth in young
meat stock, especially broiler type chicks and ducklings, which achieve slaughtering
weight and good marketable qualities in just 2 months, makes it possible to accept
them for raising on private plots prior to the commencement of autumn and even in
October in the southern regions of the country. Moreover, during the second half of
the year, considerably more favorable conditions exist for supplying the young stock
with feed, mainly variOus types of succulent and green feed obtained on the private
plots.

In this regard, it makes no sense to dissolve prematurely the parental flocks of
meat poultry, as so often happens on reproduction farms and breeding farms. All
measures must be undertaken aimed at organising the removal and sale to the
population of young beef stock throughout all of the summer months.

During the next 2-3 years, the number of parental flocks on farms in the public
sector must be increased by a minimum of 1.5-2 times and strict control must be
established over the use of pedigree products.

The technological schedules for completing the parental flocks must be composed in
a manner such that not only are the internal requirements for hybrid poultry
satisfied, but it also becomes possible to sell a maximum number of yount stock to
the population during the spring and summer months. If conditions permit, thought
should be given to organizing parental flocks, especially for meat types of
p0ultry, at the large IPS's.

Serious attention should be given to increasing the number of geese; use can be made
of succulent and green feed and natural grazing land for raising the young stock of
this poultry.

The experience accumulated in the procurement of incubative eggs of waterfowl and
young turkeys in the private sector, as practiced by interkolkhos IPS's in

Poltavskaya Oblest, vhere in 1980 approximately 2 million eggs were procured using
this method, is deserving of maximum dissemination. It is understood that the
populated points and farms where the incubative eggs are procured must be satisfactory
from the standpoint of poultry diseases and that the animals should be subjected to
veterinary control. The eggs received from private plots must necessarily be

disinfected. They should ideally be incubated in an incubator specially provided
for this purpose.

A considerable reserve for increasing the breeding of young stock for private plots
could be the use for this purpose of the various types and strains of poultry being
maintained on the collection farms of scientific-research institutes (Yerevan,

Moscow ane Polteva glinistiy hens, Rhode Island reds, ﬂew lampshires, Sussexes and
Adler silver types. strains and strain groups of ducks, geese and turkeys). The same

holds true for reserve and pedigree lines of Plymouth Rocks and Cornish hens. In
addition to the additional sOurce of incubative eggs. the sale of young stock of

rare strains, strain grOups and lines will make it possible to increase their
number, a factor which is of considerable importance.

Radical measures must be undertaken to imprOve the use of the parental flocks of
meat poultry. The experience of many farms has shown that a parental flock that is
satisfactory from a veterinary standpoint can be used for the intubetion of all
biologically full-value eggs. regardless of their weight.

During the past few years. the incubator pool for poultry raising farms and 198's
has been expanded considerably and modernised. 0n 1 January of this year, it had a
capability for handling 625.1 million eggs at all of the public farms, that is,
during the Tenth Five-Year Plan this capability had increased by 178.9 million eggs.
0n the overwhelming majority of farms and 195's, this pool consists of modern
Universal->0, Universal-SS and IKP-90 incubators.

It would seem that all of the conditions are available for a sharp increase in the
sale of yOung stock to the population. However. by no means is full use being made
of this potential. It is known that the greatest demand for young poultry stock for
the private plots lasts for 3-4 months during the spring and summer: from March
until June. It is precisely during this period that maximum use should be made of
the incubator pool. During the A months mentioned, this pool can be used for more
than faur times. Last year however. it was used only 2.1 times during these months
in the TuSSR and GSSR. Thus the pool available here, even during the period
considered tense from the standpoint of incubation, was actually empty for one half
of the time. In the BSSR, this indicator was 2.2 for the same period, in the KaSSR
-- 2.6, in the HSSR -- 2.6 and in the AzSSR -- 2.8. Hence it follows that an
improvement in the use of the capabilities of the incubators represents a great

reserve for increasing the breeding of young stock and improving the technical-
economic indicators for the incubation of eggs.

For the future, in order to achieve high rates of growth in the sale of young stock
to the population, it-will be necessary to first of all increase such sales during
the spring and summer months. Hence. even on those farms where the incubator pool
is operated at maximum capability during this period and during the remaining period
of the year it does not have a full workload, its capabilities should nonetheless

be expanded. The principal concern is achieving a maximum increase in the breeding
of yOung stock for sale to the population. The seasonal nature of such sales is a
constantly active factor and one which must be confronted.

Special attention must be given to raising the hatching percentage for the young
stock. In recent years, this indicator has worsened on a majority of the farms and
IPS's and the trend towards a further reduction continues at the present time. In
1979, for all farms of USSR Ptitseprom, the average hatching percentage for chicks
of egg-laying strains was 71.1 percent and meat strains -- 68.9 percent; the
hatching percentage was even lower for young waterfowl stock and young turkeys.

This situatiOn was caused mainly by the fact that the incubator workers attached
more importance to increasing the number of incubated eggs than they did to the
hatching of young stock. in some areas, a reduction in the hatching percentage
tends to underscore serious shortcomings in the zootechnical work. Greater use must
FOR OFFICIAL "SF. ONLY

be made of the experience of leading farms and the IPS's, which are achieving high
indicators on a regular basis. Thus, at the ’oltava IFS in the oblast of the same
name. the hatching of egg-laying strains of chicks in 1980 amounted to 84.9
percent, ducklings at the Tarashcha TPS in Kiyevskaya Oblast -- 79 percent and
goslings at the Nizhnegorsk 1P8 in Krymakaya Oblast -- 88.4 percent.

The organization of young stock sales for satisfying the requirements of the private
plots is in need of considerably improvement. The leaders and specialists at the
poultry raising farms and TPS's, in close collaboration with the settlement end
rural soviets of peoples' deputies, must study thoroughly the populations
requirements for the various types of young p0ultry stock, they must gather up the
requests in a timely manner and undertake measures to ensure that they are satisfied
completely. The population must be informed in advance concerning the schedules and
places where the young stock are to be sold and permanent sales points must be
designated. The trade in young stock must be carried out more extensively directly
in the populated points and on the production tracts of kolkhozes and sovkhozes.

The practice of concluding contracts between the IPS's and incubator houses of
poultry raising enterprises with kolkhozes and other farms, for the delivery of
young stock to kolkhoz members and manual and office workers residing on the
territories of these farms, must be given maximum support and dissemination. The
pet stOres in cities and worker settlements shOuld be supplied with greater
quantities of young poultry stock. The systematic publication in the local press

of aooveterinary advice by specialists in the raising of yOung stock and the
maintenance of adult poultry should be organised and use shOuld also be made of the
radio network for this purpose. During lectures and consultations, attention shOuld
be directed towards the need for utilizing easily accessible and cheap local feeds -
green, succulent, vitamin, mineral and food remnants.

The January 1981 decree of the CC CPSU and the USSR Council of Ministers entitled
"Additional Measures for Increasing the Production of Agricultural Products on the
Private Plots of Citizens" is opening up new and broad opportunities for developing
private paultry raising. In conformity with this decree, sovkhozes and other
agricultural enterprises are authorized and a racemmendation has been mnde to allow
kolkhozes to conclude contracts on a strictly voluntary basis with kolkhoz members
and manual and office workers residing on their territories and conscientiously
participating in public production, and also with pensioners, for the raising and
procurement of livestock and poultry.

The kolkhozes, sovkhozes and other agricultural enterprises are being tasked with
furnishing assistance to kolkhoz members and manual and office workers in the form
of young livestock and poultry, feed. grazing and haying lands and other services.
The system for selling the products produced must also be pointed out in the
contrac t.

The decree calls for other measures aimed at increasing the production of
agricultural products to the maximum possible degree, including paultry raising
products and on the private plots of kolkhoz members and manual and office workers.

The task at hand consists of carrying Out the required organizational and
explanatory work and acquainting the population on an extensive scale with the
measures called for in the mentioned decree.

On poultry raising farms in a number of republics and oblasts throughout the
country, some experience has already been accumulated in organizing the raising of
poultry for meat purposes based upon contracts concluded with the population. In
l980, the population in Odesakaya Oblast raised and turned over to the state

130,000 head of young poultry stock, the overall weight of which was 250 tons. This
year the plans call for 500 tons to be obtained. The raising of poultry by the
population in the GSSR and in a number of oblasta and krays in the RSPSR is being
organized.

A plan for selling 586 million head of young poultry stock to the population has
been established for 1981. In the majority of insttnces, this work is better
organized than it has been in previous years. During the first quarter of this
year, 32 percent more young stock were sold than during the same period in 1980.
The interkolkhoz IPS's in the Ukraine and also the state IPS's in the Russian
Federation have achineved noticeable increases.

it should be borne in mind that the 1981 plan for selling young poultry stock to the
population is minimal in nature. The paultry raising farms. IPS's and other
agricultural enterprises must ensure, as pointed out in the decree of the CC CPSU
and the USSR Council of Ministers entitled 'ﬁdditional Measures for Increasing the
Production of Agricultural Products on the Private Plots of Citizens," the sale of
yOung poultry stock to the population in quantities which will satisfy the private
plot requirements for them and taking into account the raising of poultry in
accordance with contracts with kolkhozes. sovkhozes and other agricultural
enterprises and with the organizations of consumer cooperation.

All possible measures must be undertaken to achieve the rapid development of
private poultry raising and to utilize this important reserve for increasing the
production of the branch's products.

[Article by H.V. Shakhmayaev, chief of the laboratory for the development of norms
for planning the development of the mechanization of cropping of the All-Union
Scientific Research Institute of Agricultural Hechanization, candidate in economic
sciences: "Plan- ag the Needs for Agricultural Equipment by Norss"]

[Text] The 26th CPSU Congress defined as a chief task a further improvement of
public well-being on the basisof an acceleration of scientific and technological
progress and a rise in labor productivity and an increase in its efficiency. Its
successful accomplishment depends to the large extent upon the development rates
of agricultural production.

Great importance is being attributed in this connection to a strengthening of the
material and technical base of agriculture. A scientific substantiation of norms
for farm equipment needs is an important lever which regulates the planned process
of the creation on the kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and other state agricultural enter-
prises of a machinery pool which makes it possible to perform work in all of the
country's soil and climate zones in optimal agrotechnical periods and with the
least expenditures of labor and material and monetary resources.

The sequence of the development of such norms includes the following stages:

--a discovery of the long-term production directions of agricultural enterprises
and the classification by type of all of the farms of every area by specialization
groups. The long-term specialization of the farms was calculated in accordance
with the "Plans for the 0rgsnizational-Hanagerial Structure of Kolkhozes and
Sovkhozes for 1980-1990";

-the singling out of typical farms (object-representatives)which reflect the most
important characteristics of their specializations;

-—a calculation of optimal equipment needs for typical farms. In the formation of
the machinery and tractor pool account is taken of efficient forms of the use of
machines and of pronising technologies. A comparative evaluation of the differ-
ent methods of mechanizing operations in keeping with the criterion of adduced ex-
penditures makes it possible to arrive at the selection of equip-ent from a nation-

al economic point of view and to ensure, in this way, uniformity in determining the
most effective sets of machines with respect to the concrete conditions of the
farms;

--the development of the equipment need norms of a typical farm for the mechaniza-
tion of cropping. The relative indicators which express the number of machines per
1000 hectares of arable land or sowings (plantings) of agricultural crops (perennial
plantings) are taken as these norms;

--a weighted average calculation of the norms by levels of planning (typical farm,
oblast, economic region, republic, and the country as a whole).

In order to give consideration to the conditions for the production of agricultural
output in all of the mechanization zones the calculations of the equipment need
norms were performed on the basis of typical farms which reflect the special char-
acteristics of growing and harvesting crops in the economic regions and union re—
publics. The basis for the development of the norms consisted of 172 object-repre-
sentative farms. The norms are determined on the basis of the optimal size of a

machine and tractor pool calculated with the help of the mathematical economic
method on computers:

The relative data presented in Table 1 testifies to the stable character of a
number of equipment need norms (tractors, general purpose plows, continuous soil
cultivators, disc Cultivators, grain harvesting combines, buck rakes, fodder har-
vesting combines, potato planters, and cultivator~hillers). During the years 1976-
1980 and for the 11th Five-Year Plan a system of norms developed which permitted
their use by planning and directive agencies for the formation of machinery and
tractor pools for kolkhozes and sovkhozes which were in accord with the concrete
conditions of the farms during the planning period. At the same time, one's attent-
ion is struck by the important changes in the needs for anti-soil-erosion machines,
Sprayers, and cotton harvesting nachines which increased by 2.6, 2.3, and 2.2 times.
respectively. This is explained by the necessity for shifting to industrial tech—

nologies.

The creation and introduction of a complex of highly productive machines leads

to a decrease in the need norms. Thus, with the mass employment of the RKS-6 and
BH-6a sugar beet harvesting complex. and of the RKS-h and BH-é for irrigated sugar
beet zones, the need norms decreased by 65 percent, which is indicated by the data
in Table 1. And the use of such modern combines as the KSK-lOO fodder harvesting
combine and the two-row combines for continuous cabbage harvesting, as well as the
KSKU—é corn harvesting combine, leads to a decrease in the norms of h.3, 33. and

17 percent,respectively.

The kolkhoz and sovkhoz equipment need norms make it possible to provide the
country's republics and economic regions with a set of agricultural machines and
tractors of various traction classes, although, it is true, the latter show import-
ant regional differences (Table 2). Thus, with an average union level of 1h.65
units, the smallest number of these machines and tractors in physical terms per
1000 hectares of arable land occurs in the West Siberian economic region--7.97
units, the East Siberian economic region-~8.l3 units, and the economic regions of
the Kazakh SSR-—8.l9 units, while the largest number occurs in the Turkmen SSR--
4h.6 units and the Tajik SSR--h3.3 units where the proportion of arable land in
the structure of agricultural land is negligible; in the Uzbek SSR with its devel-
oped cotton farming the number is 64.74 units, and in the Georgian SSR where per—
ennial plants occupy a leading place in agriculture the number is 39.60 units.

There is also a substantial fluctuation by regions in the need for machines for
sowing and harvesting grain crops, for applying fertilizers, and for chemical plant
protection. A further development of the overall mechanization of the growing and
harvesting of agricultural crops and a shift to industrial technologies is a very
important condition for the equalization of these norms.

Using the norms, it is possible to define a scientifically substantiated need for
machines for growing and harvesting agricultural crops in accordance with the fol-
lowing formula:

"in
er-m- -0.WI H",

"here x--is the need for tractors and agricultural machines at the end of the
planning period, units;

H--are the kolkhoz and sovkhoz need norms for tractors and agricultural mach-
ines for 1000 hectares of arable land or of agricultural crops, units;

ﬂ--is the arable or agricultural crop area, hectares.

On the basis of the overall needs, the annual deliveries of machines for the five-
year plan are established:

and with a planned area of 132,526,000 hectares, the need will be:

With the number of sowers on 1 January 1981 amounting to 1,070,000 units and an
annual write-off of 105,000 units, their delivery will be:

A shift from union-republic norms to norms for an oblast or farm is achieved with
the help of the following formula:

"I "’ lﬁ’iL-o

Where Hx——is the need norm for tractors and agricultural machines for the cropping
of an oblast (rayon, farm);

Kp--is the output norm with regard to the basic norm-forming factors of the
union republic (economic region);

Kx--is the output norm with regard to the basic norm-forming factors of the
oblast (rayon, farm). unit of output.

For example. with a yield of 33 quintals per hectare and a run of 600-1000 meters
the output norm of the "Kolos" SK-6 grain harvesting combine comes to 11.6 hectares,
while with a yield of 23.9 quintals per hectare and the same run it is 13.1 hect-
ares. The planned yield and the run length in the first case are the norm-forming
factors of the North Caucasian economic region, and in the second case of
Krasnodarskiy Kray.

Using these norms, let us determine the need for SK-6 grain harvesting combines for
Krasnodarskiy Kray, picking as our basis the norm for the North Caucasian economic
region of 2.5 units per 1000 hectares: -

The overall Krasnodarskiy Kray kolkhoz and sovkhoz need norm for grain harvesting

combines will come to 6.07 units per 1000 hectares of grain crops excluding corn
and rice.

The need norm for these combines, for example, for the "Hoskvoretskiy" sovkhoz in
Hoskovskaya Oblast of the Central Economic Region, with a run length of 300-400
meters and ayield of 36-39 quintals per hectares, is calculated as follows:

of 23 quintals per hectare (the norm-forming factors correspond to the
Central Economic Region), hectares;

forming factors of the "Hoskvoretskiy" sovkhoz), hectares;

11.7--the output norm of the "Kolos" SK-6 combine with a reaper of five meters
for the conditions of the Central Economic Region, hectares;

l.0-0.6-the Central Economic Region kolkhoz and sovkhoz need norm for the

"Kolos" SK-6 and the "Niva" SK—S grain harvesting combines, units
per 1000 hectares.

The overall need norm for grain harvesting combines of the "Hoskvoretskiy" sovkhoz
will come to 11.35 units per 1000 hectares of grain crops.
