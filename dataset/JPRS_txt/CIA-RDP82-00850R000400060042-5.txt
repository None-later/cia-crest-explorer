CARBON FIBER PLANT IN FRANCB--ElF-Aquitaine has just concluded an agreement with
Toray Industries (Japan) and Union Carbide (United States) to engage in a joint
"construction and location study for a carbon fiber production unit in France."
This news thus confirms the ELF-Aquitaine group's development plan relating to
high-performance composite materials, a plan examined in detail in AIR 8 COSMOS

No 860 p 38. Though the wording of the agreement remains cautious (referring

only to a study), it nonetheless remains that an important hurdle has just been
cleared by the ELF-Aquitaine group, in that on one hand these studies will now be
carried out in a concrete framework of cooperation, with involvement of the world
leader in this type of material (Torayl, and on the other hand this agreement, to-
gether with the one concluded with SE? (European Propellant Company], places the
ELF-Aquitaine group in the position of leader in the eyes of the government authori-
ties, particularly GIHAC (Interminisberial Group for Composite Materials] (AIR &
COSMOS No 866 p 28). For the sake of completeness, we should mention that Toray and
Union Carbide have already concluded an agreement for cooperation in setting up a
production plant in the United States using the Toray processes. The agreement
with ELF-Aquitaine will thus create a world triangle of interests covering the
world's three great fiber consumer centers: Japan, Europe, and North America.

COMPOSITE-MATERIAL BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION-Under the title “Project: Polystal‘gx'
Bayer Reports write: "Perroconcrete, stressed ateel-who would not associate
these ideas with the highest quality concerning strength, load-carrying ability
and resistance to weathering? But even here corrosion damage cannot be exclud-
ed...." The report goes on to say that Strabag AG in Duesseldorf has built a
stressed-concrete bridge in which fiberglass-reinforced material has replaced
steel. and expectations are that the bridge will confirm the suitability of the
new building material in a long-term test. The project received financial sup-
port fron the Ministry for Research and Technology. Further areas of application
for Polystal are mentioned: ropes for masts (up to 30 as). lines for pulling
underground cables, sections for plastic-covered greenhouses, tent roof designs,
etc. It is interesting to note how Bayer has skillfully patented the concept
"Polystal" by avoiding the correct spelling of the word "Stahl" steel. (A prac-
tice long current in English-speaking countries.) The intention, as can easily
be deduced, is to use steel's good reputation to improve sales of artificial
materials. [Text] [Duesseldorf STAHL UND 8152“ in German 27 Jul 81 p 56]

ITALIAN INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS ANALYZED
Paris LE PROGRES SCIENTIFIQUB in French Mar-Apr 81 pp 65-49

[Article by the French Embassy in Rome]

After having reached within a few years, a respectable position in the machine tool
sector--Italy currently being the fifth largest producer and third largest exporter
in the world-- robotics is an area in which the dynamism and enterprising spirit of
Italian producers should become evident in the future.

Italian robot builders, whose number has tripled in less than 10 years, enjoy a

rapidly expanding market which they have regained before successfully undertaking
exportation by means which have often been original and highly technical.

The Industrial Robot Market

The development of the Italian industrial robotics market has been very sustained
during the last five years, with an average annual growth rate of 62.6 percent in
numbers of robots, and [31.2 percent in value, while exportation expanded at a rate
of 68.1 percent per year in numbers, and 151.6 percent in value.

During these last years we have thus witnessed a true retrieval of the domestic
market on the part of Italian robot producers, since the trade balance in this
domain has moved from a negative figure in 1977 (-5 billion lire) to a positive one
of 5 billion lire in I979.

The Robot Industry

Whereas there were only four builders in 1972, thirteen enterprises are currently
producing rnbots in Italy; with the exception of Olivetti-Osai whose plants are
located in Hezzogiorno near Caserta, all the other companies are installed in the
industrial north.

Robot producers can be classified into three major categories:

Subsidiaries of large user enterprises, Coaau for Flat and Oaai for Olivetti;

Medium-size enterprises which have traditionally manufactured measurement

instruments or fixed welding and painting stations, and which have diversified into
robotics, such as Basfer. Gaiotto. Des. Elfin, Bisiach e Carru. and Marin;

And small, recently created “artisan” enterprises specializing in robotics. such as
Norda, Aisa, Camel, Jobs. and Sla.

Some of them have specific characteristics. Comau for instance, supplies integrated
systems intended to automate complete production cycles (welding. painting. and so
on), and focuses on flexibility: Robogate, Robocarriers, and flexible transfer and
machining lines.

0n the other hand, Norda mass produces simple medium-size and small servo arms,

while Jobs manufactures servo arms for machine tools on the principle of automation
islands.

As a rule. robots are produced in small lots just like machine tools, in assembly
units which group a limited number of highly qualified employees.

As we have seen. the Italian robot production has undergone a spectacular
development during the last few years (annual average of 62.6 percent). with a large

portion of this equipment being exported. During 1979. of the 620 robots produced
(20 billion lire). 160 were exported (7.8 billion lire) as shown in table 4.

Inventory '
Depending on the source. figures on the number of industrial robots installed in
Italy vary greatly. The Italian Society for Industrial Robotics (SIRI) counted 353

in I980, while the Federation of Scientific and Technical Associations (FAST) shows
the number to be 750.

According to a FAST study, which appears to use a broader definition of robots. more
than one-half of that figure is represented by servo arms for feeding and unloading
pressurennolding machines.

Spray-painting robots represent 12 percent of the installed inventory; the Basfer
Company of Honza is only second to Trallfa in Europe. Spot welding, used mainly in
the automotive industry, represents 16 percent of the installed robots. It should
be noted that in this field the Italian technology is different from that used in
the United States and Japan (continuous welding).

The use of assembly robots is still limited and concentrates mainly on electronic
components (Sigma-03ml) and on small electromechanical ones (Prague-Des).

The utilization of robots in Italy developed primarily in the automotive industry.
and especially at Fiat. which together with Volvo, appears to be the largest
European user of robots.

However, while Volvo has recently ordered some one hundred Cincinnati robots, Fiat
uses more than 200, or approximately as many as General Motors, for a production
which represents one-quarter that of the American company. Moreover, the proportion
of its own robots (notably Polar 6000 and Comau to the detriment of Unimation) is
constantly growing. and the success encountered by these robots abroad, notably in
Sweden (Volvo 262 and 2&4 production) and the United States (Chrysler Horizon)
merits attention.

The pursuit of an ever greater automation of the production cycle has led Fiat to
perfect for the past two years the Robogste system, which is very advanced in its
integration and flexibility, allowing as it does the assembly of several different
models on a single production line.

Three Robogste systems are presently operating at Fiat in the Rivolta, Cassino, and
Termini Imerese plants; two others have been installed at Seat and five at Chrysler.

The introduction of robots at Fiat, which began in I972 on the assembly line for the
132 (20 robots), reflects the company's interest in reducing production costs (but
the economic efficiency of installations as complex as Robogate remains to be
demonstrated) and in improving working conditions, especially in particularly
sensitive production areas: rigidity of welding stations, toxic paint vapors.

Fiat currently uses 200 robots for welding. 75 of them in the production of Ritmo
alone (Unimation and Polar 6000). The paint shops use some thirty arms
(Trallfa-Basfer), but Piat's objective is to fully robotize this area of production
in which employees no longer want to work.

This concern for improving working conditions through elimination of repetitive,
physically demanding, and dangerous jobs, meets with the unions' approval.

About 25 robots are operating at Alfa Romeo (foundry, forging, welding, painting).
Some thirty should be installed during 1980-1981. and about one hundred in the next
five years, but the recent Alfa-Nissan agreement will probably change these
forecasts (undoubtedly toward more robotization?).

In general, we note that if the Italian automotive industry makes a rather broad use
of robots for welding and painting, the introduction of robots in mechanical

assembly operations which require speed and accuracy is still limited, and even
experimental.

He will mention the case of Alfa Romeo, which uses an Olivetti-Osai Sigma robot to
insert engine stud bolts under satisfactory economic conditions, since the
installation was amortized in one and one-half years when two to three years are

generally the rule. According to specialists. the final assembly of cars appears to
be rather difficult to robotize because it would require highly sophisticated

machines. Research is nevertheless in progress at the Fiat Research Center for the
development of a robot-TV-computer system capable of defining the center of gravity
of a part which the arm would have to grasp within a rather large space.

Evaluation and Development Prospects

It would thus appear that the Italian approach to robotics differs rather
significantly from that of other industrialized countries, where robot production is
in general a diversification operation on the part of large and medium-sized
enterprises which produce investment goods. Their objectives are consequently
primarily quantitative and result in an effort toward standardization and mass
production. In Italy, the development is based mostly on new applications and
quality objectives. starting with robots produced in small lots (except for Norda).
As in the case of machine tools, the Italian enterprises have opted to focus on just
a few areas, by proposing solutions which meet as well as possible the needs of
users, and which are capable of adapting to changes in their demands. During the
last few years, we have thus witnessed the creation of many new companies which live
on very specific products.

As a rule. therefore, the Italian producers conduct almost no basic research, but
rather devote their efforts to development research, notably to sensor improvement
(optical, acoustical, touch) and to the performance of microprocessors, which must
be capable of responding to very diversified situations.

Particular care is also devoted to the preliminary installation of robots in
industrial units, and to their placement in operation, which can amount up to
50 percent of the cost of the installation.

Results have been rather spectacular, since in very short order the Italian industry
has been able to recover its fully expanding domestic market, as well as use often
original solutions to gain a strong position in exportation (Robogste and Polar 6000
of Comau, handling arms from Norda, Sigma Olivetti for assembly, Basfer painting
robots, and so on). Significant in this respect are the examples of DEA. world
leader in measurement instruments, who has just turned over to General Electric the
license for its Pragma assembly robot, or the interest shown in Italian
builders--such as Jobs--by the British company Fairey, or still, the agreements
signed to develop joint research.

As for the future, the prospects for industrial reconversion and restructuring in
Italy (Law 675) lead us to think that the robotics and industrial automation market
will continue to grow in years to come at a particularly high rate, a growth from
which the Italian robot producers will be the first to benefit.

Moreover, even though up to now the government aid from a special fund for applied
research managed by Istituto Hobiliare Italiano (IMI) has been almost negligible in
this sector, it is not excluded that as part of the sector plans that are being
formulated, the government will show more future interest in exploiting the
unquestionable trump cards which it is holding. If this were not so, there remains
no doubt that as soon as their products become old, the small robot producers would
risk becoming victims of their narrow specialization policy, of their weak financial
standing for investment. and of the limited means devoted to research.

And finally, as can be seen from table 6, it appears that the Italian producers

depend strongly on foreign suppliers for components, and especially for sensitive
sub-assemblies, a condition which makes them somewhat vulnerable.

Yet, the sophisticated components (recognition and visualization devices, sensors.
and so on) whose development is still in the basic research field, are asked to play
a fundamental role in the intelligence of future robots, and will thus increasingly

affect their construction costs.

't can be estimated however that the innovative capability of enterprises and their
trade dynamism, the forthcoming restructuring of the public and private electronic
industry, and the desire of the government to promote certain strategic areas
through sector plans (electronics, automotive, components, and so on) and to aid
research, are all trump cards uhich should allow the Italian industry to not only
free itself from foreign dependence for sub-assemblies, as they have been able to do
for robots during recent years. but also to further assert themselves on the
domestic and foreign markets.

into the assembly shop of a Japanese automobile manufacturer, it is a reproduction
of reality in the Hannover Volkswagen plant. It shows the newly installed produc—
tion line with automated handling machines. which are taking over operations in
van and pickup truck assembly that previously had to be carried out by humans, re-
quiring great physical effort. At the same time, robot assembly offers the de—
sired effect of great flexibility in program control and increasing the speed of
production, in sun, therefore. of lowering costs.

DIFFEWCES OF OYINION ON MD? 100 PROJECT
Paris AIR & cosms in French 29 Aug 81 p 8
[Article: "MD? 100 Project: Differences of Opinion"]

[Text] At the end of last month [July] the Netherlands press took stock of dif-
ferences of opinion between Fokker and Mel mell Douglas on the MD? 100 project.
The two manufacturers, handling different projects (the P 29 and the DC-ll).
initially chalked up differences of opinion on 180 points. At the end of last
month their points of view still disagreed on 70 points, including the design
capacity for the new aircraft. Fokker would prefer to start from the basis of an
airplane with 130 seats and a single aisle, which does not agree with the McDonnell
Douglas concept. The two manufacturers have therefore decided to approach the
airlines to obtain their reactions: McDonnell Douglas is in contact with United
and Delta in particular, while Fokker is consulting Km in particular. The two
manufacturers hope that around November they will be able to arrive at complete
integration of their respective points of view. Thus the effective launching of
the ND? 100 project will depend essentially on market reactions.

Our correspondent in Tokyo indicates that in Japanese aeronautic circles Boeing

is still considered the manufacturer favored for a cooperative program to build a
ISO-seat plane. It is speculated that the conditions offered by McDonnell Douglas
and Fokker could elicit even more attractive offers from Boeing, and the neat
arrival of a delegation from Boeing is awaited. The Minister of Industry and

Foreign Trade affirms that so far nothing is set concerning Japan's participation
in a cooperative program to build a short- to Iedim-range ISO-seat plane.
