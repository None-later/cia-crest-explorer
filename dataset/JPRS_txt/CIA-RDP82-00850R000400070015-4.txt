NYERERE, AHIDJO VISIT HITTERRAND
Paris JEUNE AFRIQUE in French No 1082, 30 Sep 81 p 25
[AItlc1e= "Nyerere Resssured, Ahidjo Sstisfied"]

[Text] The African ballet goes on at the Elysee (JA, No 1079). Julius Nyerere,
Tanzanian head of state, who arrived in Paris on 16 September. met with President
Francois Hitterrand the following day. The two men easily settled "as among
socialists" the minor Franco-Tanzanian dispute which arose from the spirited visit
to Dar es Salaam which Louis de Guiringaud. Valery Giacard d'Bstaing's foreign
affairs ministers paid in August 1977.

Nyerere, who is the first head of state of English-speaking Africa invited to visit
Paris, is also the chairman of the Front Line states. Consequently. he tried to
persuade his counterpart to play a sore active role in the UN within the contact
group for Namibia. He said that "Once that country becomes independent and will no
longer be used by the South Africans as a base for aggression against Angola the
Cuban troops will leave."

Another subject particularly close to the heart of the Tanzanian president is the
North-South dialog. 0n the eve of the Cancmf (Mexico) summit, planned for October,
the new French views on this topic could sound only reassuring to one of the most
persistent heads of state in the denunciation of neocolonislist relations . which
are still ruling the world's economy. In turn. Francois Hitterrand precisely
intends to decolonize relations between France and Africa. Hence his announced
intention to develop cooperation with the former British colonies. He may have
noticed. however, that Nyerere asked for no assistance whatever despite Tanzanian
financial needs. However, Dar es Salaam is hoping for the support of France as
member of the UN Security Council of the candidacy of Salim Ahmed Salim, Tanzanian
foreign affairs ministers, for the position of UN secretary general. The succession

of Kurt Haldhein by an African would be a victory for the Third Horld, which could
only please socialist France.

Nyerere had barely left when the French officials assigned a choice seat to Ahmadou
Ahidjo, the Cameroonian. In the course of a 4-day visit to Paris he held .
discussions with Francois Hitterrsnd, Prime Minister Pierre Hsuroy and ministers

Charles Hernu (defense), Claude Cheysson (foreign affairs) and Jean-Pierre Cot
(cooperation and development).

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

Jean-Pierre Cot had spoken of "model" cooperation with Cameroon. If the statements
made by the two parties following the talks are to be believed. such cooperation can
only be strengthened. As the head of a stable country in a rather troubled part of
Africa. President Ahidjo needed the assurance of support from Paris. whose interest
is well served by helping this small island of calm. Has this why his first talk
was with Charles Hernu? whatever the case. military cooperation was one of the main
topics discussed during the visit.

Yet it was not the only one. Not to mention the major political problems which are
shaking up the African continent from Namibia to the Sahara, Chad and Central Africa
in particular, bilateral problems were extensively discussed. The point is that
Cameroon, which is in a state of full economic boom thanks to the exploitation of
its petroleum deposits and. even more so of the prospects created by the discovery
of huge natural gas deposits, has ambitious energy, agricultural and industrial
plans. Consequently, it has asked for specific French help in their implementation,
while underlining the urgency of rebalancing trade between the two countries, which
is unfavorable to Cameroon. Despite his legendary circumspection. Aha-adou Ahidjo
left Paris clearly pleased, describing his French counterpart as "a firm ally."

France's new policy in Chad, one of Cameroon's main concerns, having been strongly
buffeted by the effects of the war, will assuredly contribute to the strengthening
of the honeymoon. It is not the welccne reserved to the Chadian Coukouni Oueddei on
17 September that could tarnish such prospects.

FRENCH TRADE WITH AFRICA IN 1980 SHOWS OVERALL SURPLUS

Paris HARCHES TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANBBNS in French No 1870, ll Sep 8]
pp 2316-2319

[Text] Because of Africa's special place in France's overall foreign trade
(nearly 11 percent) and the privileged relationship with sons African coun-
tries. it appeared necessary not only to review trade between France and
Africa, but also to make a distinction between so-called "French-speaking"
Africa, countries which are former French colonies for the lost part and which
enjoy closer ties with France, and the rest of Africa. The other distinction
to be made in this survey is the one used by the Organization of African Unity,

dividing the continent into major geographical sectors.

The data available on French-African foreign trade were initially grouped on
the basis of these two distinctions: on the one hand, by geographical zone;
and on the other by singling out the position of French-speaking Africa. Oil
imports were also separated out because of the increasing share of French pur-

chases they represent.

1In tonnage, oil amounted to 20.7 million tons in 1979 and 19.6 million tons in
1980.

A review of Table l and comparisons with previous years solicit the following
comments:

French trade with Africa in in a largely surphsspoaition. Although it does
not compare with the 1978 surplus, in contrast with 1979, it increased from
12.3 billion francs to 13.6 billion in 1980 (excluding SA), or by 9 percent.
This growth in the trade surplus between France and Africa is the result of an
18.6 percent increase in the surplus with French-speaking African countries.
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

It went up in fact from 11.8 billion in 1979 to 14 billion. 0n the other

hand, France's trade balance with the other African countries continues to
decline and is even showing a deficit (-0.6 billion) now, after a 1.1 billion
drop. The trade deficit between France and South Africa has decreased slightly.
from 1.8 billion in 1979 to 1.02 billion in 1980.

As for the overall trend of French sales and purchases with Africa, it can be
seen that the considerable upswing observed in 1979 has continued in 1980.

In fact. total French sales to Africa have increased from 44.8 billion francs
in 1979 to 58.2 billion in 1980, or a 30 percent increase in value. This is
substantially higher than French inflation. at about 13 percent in 1980, and
thus implies an important growth of French sales to Africa in real terns.

French purchases from Africa also continue to rise sharply, from 32.5 billion
francs in 1979 to 44.8 billion in 1°80, or an increase in current value of

27.5 percent. If inflation in these countries--closc to 20 percent--is factored
in, then French purchases from this part of the world have increased very little
in real terms.

 

———————_——-

France and African Countries in 1980

Total French imports : 570.8 billion francs.
imports from Africa (including SA) : 49.9 billion.

Total French exports ' 469.7 billion francs.
Exports to Africa (including SA) : 62.3 billion.
Overall trade balance : -101.1 billion francs.
French-African trade balance (including SA): + 12.3 billion.
Africa's share of French Foreign Trade:

[sports from Africa : 8.7 percent of the total;
Exports to Africa : 13.3 percent of the total.
Main African customer: Algeria : 11.1 billion francs.

Main African supplier: Nigeria : 12.7 billion francs.

 

There are considerable differences between the various geographical sectors in
Africa. It is possible to gain an initial idea of these differences from
Table 2.

Although North Africa's share of French exports is still the largest, it shows
a considerable drop nevertheless. In 1979, it accounted for 53.3 percent of
French purchases (excluding SA). and only 49.8 percent in 1980.

The same comment holds true for France's purchases from that part of the conti-

nent. They accounted for 37.4 percent of French purchases from Africa (exclud-
ing SA) in 1979. and 35.7 percent in 1980, or a decrease of almost 2 points.

French-speaking countries 56.8 50.6 69.1 63.2

Not only is West Africa still France's privileged partner for inports in 1980,
but the percentage of French purchases in these countries has even grown, from
41.5 percent to 45.1 percent, or by about 5 points for French purchases from
West Africa. The percentage of French sales in this region remains unchanged
and accounts for slightly more than 29 percent in both 1980 and 1979.

For the other main geographical areas of Africa, there are generally very few
changes in either imports or exports. It should, however. be pointed out that
French sales to the Indian Ocean area amount to 6.3 percent of total French
sales in Africa in 1980, as compared with 2.6 percent in 1979. In other
words, total French sales to this region lore than doubled in value.

There is another important point to make before taking a closer look at France's
trade with French-speaking Africa versus the rest of Africa. You will observe
in fact that the percentage of both French purchases and sales with this area
of the world have declined considerably in 1980 over the previous year.

France's sales to French-speaking Africa amounted to 72.6 percent of total

sales to Africa (excluding SA) in 1979, and only 67.6 percent in 1980. As for
purchases from France, they went down from about 64 percent to 57 percent.

French Trade With French-Speaking Africa

Despite the facts just cited, French-speaking Africa still constitutes a very
important group of partners in France's total trade with Africa.

You can see from an initial glance at Tables 3 and 4 that the North African
countries occupy an important place; the same is true for the Heat African
countries. Attention is drawn more specifically to the dominant position of
Algeria and Morocco in the first group and Ivory Coast in the second, as these
three countries account for 53 percent of French sales to French-speaking
African countries and 55 percent of French purchases from the same area.

French Imports From French-Speaking Africa

Table lo already gives us a better idea of the role played by each country in
this area in its trade with France.

Algeria is far and away France's main trading partner: 29 percent of French
imports from French-speaking African countries come from Algeria and 28 per- _
cent of French exports to that area go to that country. -

sh“

French imports from Algeria amount to 7.3 billion francs, or an increase of
57 percent over the previous year. The bulk of Algerian exports to France are
hydrocarbons. France buys 4 percent of its total oil tonnage from Algeria
(4.5 million tons in 1980). Sales of Algerian natural gas to France amount
to 1.5 billion cubic meters. They are expected to rise to 5 billion cubic
meters in 1981.

France's total share in Algerian foreign trade amounted to 20 percent in 1980
(25 percent imports, 13 percent exports). France is Algeria's second largest
trading partner after the United States, major buyers of crude oil.

Mauritania was France's main supplier of iron ore in 1979. It ranked third in
1980 with 2.9 million tons. behind Brazil, the main supplier (4.10 million tons)
and Sweden (3.2 milliou tons). The total tonnage of this ore coming from
Mauritania now amounts to only barely 16 percent, as compared to 18 percent

in 1979.

The majority of French purchases from Morocco is composed of ninerals: mangan-
ese, phosphate, lead, zinc, and cobalt. With 26,700 tons of lead, Morocco is
France‘s second supplier (Ireland is first with 34,200 tons). It is the only
cobalt supplier with 5,700 tons, on the decline. French imports of this min-
eral have dropped sharply since 1979 when they were at 7,700 tons--a drop of

26 percent in tons imported. Sales of Moroccan phosphates to France have risen
slightly. They are at 2.6 million tons and account for Us percent of total tons
bought by France.

Morocco supplies France with some fruits, primarily citrus fruits, and fresh
vegetables. However, Moroccan exports of fresh produce to France account for

only 26 percent of that country's total sales to France.

Ivory coast is primarily a supplier of farm products to France. These include
mainly unroasted coffee, cocoa, tropical wood and fruit (pineapple and bananas).
Ivory Coast is way ahead of Brazil as the main supplier of French coffee, with
total exports of 72,100 tons in 1980, or 23 percent of French purchases of un-
roasted coffee. France bought 25,900 tons of cocoa beans from Ivory Coast in
1980. It is France's main supplier with 106 percent of total sales of cocoa
beans. He should, however, point out the substantial decrease in comparison
with 1979, when France bought 32,600 tons of that product fron Ivory Coast
(-20.6 percent). Attention should also be drawn to the sharp decline in the
value of these French purchases in comparison with I979 (-35 percent), because
of the drop in cocoa prices on the world market.

Tunisia, with 7 percent of French imports from French-speaking Africa and

10 percent of exports, is an important trading partner for France. Attention
should be drawn to the item, clothing and clothing accessories in fabric:
339.3 million francs or 20 percent of Tunisian exports to France. They
consist primarily of men's pants and shirts. Besides this item, Tunisia
sells France crude oil, fertilizer (more specifically superphosphates). and
some citrus fruits. Another rather important item sold is olive oil.

You will notice that Cameroon plays a relatively important role in France's
trade with French-speaking Africa. with about 7 percent of French imports
and 8 percent of French exports. This situation has remained relatively
stable over the past 3 years.

Gabon's position as a French supplier in French-speaking Africa is gaining
importance. Nearly 11 percent of French imports come from this country and
consist mostly of tropical wood and especially crude oil (1.4 million tons in
1980).

of 16,431 tons of raw copper--a decrease of 31 percent. It is worth noting,
nevertheless, that France's overall purchases of copper worldwide went down
from 21,258 tons in 1979 to 17,896 tons in 1980, or by 16 percent.

French purchases of bauxite from Guinea account for 72 percent of France's
foreign supplies. Guinea is the main supplier at 980,000 tone, but here

too the volume sold has declined since 1979 (-34 percent), and, Just as with
copper, French imports of bauxite worldwide are considerably less in 1980
than in 1979 (-21 percent). The substantial reduction in Guinean bauxite

has been taken up by Greece (209,000 tons in 1980 as compared to 104,000
tons in 1979).

Table 5 gives a breakdown of France's main imports from French-speaking Africa.

We should finally point to the continuous growth in French purchases of crude
oil from these countries: 29.3 percent of the total value of purchases from
this area, at 6,322,500 tons, slightly down from 1979 (6,840,200 tons).

French Exports to French-Speaking Africa

According to what might almost be called "a certain tradition," trade between
France and developing countries, which include the French-speaking African
countries, is based on French purchases of unprocessed or semiprocessed agri-
cultural products from modern farms and minerals, and French sales made up
primarily of manufactures and capital goods. Exports to these countries are
therefore highly varied. But some products or groups of products are predomi-
nant, and these inc1ude essentially food products, beverages and tobacco, and
also pharmaceutical products.

The desire of developing countries, however, to promote their industrializa-
tion implies a certain change in French sales. For instance, taking food pro-
ducts, sales increasingly involve unprocessed goods such as wheat, malt and
dairy products, which are then processed into goods for final consumption in
the importing country. This development also entails increased sales of
capital goods.

A final hmportant item is sales of transportation equipment, whatever the final
use of the vehicle may be.

In conclusion, we should stress the fact that the French trade balance with
these countries still registers a large surplus in spite of the desire of the
suppliers to bring it into closer balance (graph 3).

Attention should finally be drawn to the predominant position of Algeria,
France's main supplier and customer. But you should take note of Algeria's
new policy which seems to be temporarily curbing large equipment contracts so
that it can complete its own industrialization process. :n response to a grow-
ing demand by its people, however, the share of consumer goods has sharply
increased, inc1uding both foodstuffs and household appliances. Together they
account for one-fourth of Algerian imports in 1980.

Moreover, a push to decentralize, allowing small local businesses to develop,
and the position given the private sector open up interesting prospects for

small and medium-sized French firms. The change of government in France,
which was favorably received in Algeria, seems to have boosted trade between
the two countries, favoring housing and the automobile industry especially.

PEACE VIEWED AS NECESSITY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF RESOURCES

Paris MARCHES TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANBENS in French No 1872, 25 Sep 81 p 2461

[Text] The invasion of Angola by South African nilitary forces and the bombings
inflicted on the southern provinces by Pretoria's planes must not mask the fact
that the young independent nation has the means needed to emerge from the trap of
underdevelopment, on the condition that it regains peace and has the time necessary
to organize. A South African weekly, the FINANCIAL HAIL of Johannesburg, recently
observed this.

The military operations in southern Angola, even before the attacks at the end of
August and beginning of September, totally upset the economic life of this livestock-
raising region. The difficulties encountered in the factories, at the ports and on
the Benguela railroad line, difficulties to which the sabotage actions of the domes-
tic opposition have contributed, have affected production and make any planning
haphazard. Refugees have flowed toward the center of Angola, whose resources they
are absorbing. They constitute a continuing political threat.

At the origin of this situation, if one takes the Angolan view, is South Africa,
and behind South Africa is President Reagan's America. Pretoria, Luanda states.
arms and rrains the UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] and
Washington covers the operation. Consequently, despite the "hard line" followed

by President Reagan, Angola is seeking contact with the Nest. which, for its part,
hopes that the normalization of relations will go as far as possible because Angola
is a commercial partner worthy of confidence and needs foreign investments for a

certain number of nonstrategic industrial enterprises: cement, wood, breweries.

Naturally, it is oil that has guaranteed Angola of large reserves in foreign ex-
change and has brought it Western friendships. 'Over the next 10 years, operations

will continue in the country's two major oil fields: the one located off the coast
of Cabinda which now provides nearly three-fourths of production and the one lo-
cated near Luanda. Since the 1978 law, discoveries are the property of the govern-
ment and "the concessions are a thing of the past," as Minister Jorge Horais says.

Clearly, this means that the foreign companies must be in partnership with the
government firm SONANGOL [Angolan National Fuel Company), using two types of agree-
ments: either the joint venture type, according to which the Angolan Government
holds a minimum of 51 percent of the shares; or agreements covering the sharing of
production, according to which the government's percentage varies, based on a

15

FOR OFFICML USE ONLY
ms orncut use om

distribution of 60 percent (minimum) for the government and 40 percent for the
foreign company. This strict policy nevertheless continues to attract foreign
firms: Gulf Oil, PETROBAS [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], Texaco, ELF-Aquitaine
[Gasoline and Lubricants Company of France] and others. The situation will be
modified as Angola acquires the technology and the know-how it still lacks.

The sixth-ranking producer on the African continent, the country has sizable re-

serves, but it is concerned about conserving its supply and is not hurrying their
exploitation. Production, which was 160,000 barrels a day last year, is to rise

slowly to 200,000 barrels a day in 1983.

Outside of oil, diamonds are a considerable source of foreign currency receipts for

Angola. Production remains at 1.4 million carats in 1980. The best year was 1972,
with a production of 2 million carats.

Angolan mining deposits include 34 mineral products, 14 of which are of strategic
importance. Geological studies made during the colonial period have been reap-

praised with the aid of Soviet experts. Priorities have been established for
their working.

In particular. Angola has iron ore deposits - 500,000 tons were mined last year -
that constitute the basis making it possible to get a local steel industry going.

There are actually three trump cards: the Cassinga deposits, the hydroelectric
power supplied by the Cunene Dam and the Hocamedes mining port, served by the rail-

road. The problem for the immediate present is that these three assets are all
near the region of the South African invasion.

The rest of Angola's resources are precarious. Income crops (including the most
important one, coffee) are far from the levels they had reached during the colonial
period. The industrial sector has not recovered from the exodus of the Portuguese
at the time of independence and the war with South Africa'in 1975-1976 (85 percent
of the factories were paralyzed at that time). The main problem now is that of
maintaining and replacing the equipment, which suffered a long-period of disuse.

Concerning transport, the situation is not brilliant, not only because the infra-
structures were little developed during the colonial period, but also because fol-
lowing the war with South Africa, 80 percent of the bridges and 90 percent of the

transport capacity were destroyed. Out of 28,000 trucks, for example, no more than
2,500 were left.

As for the Benguela railroad, which serves the interior of Angola and which makes

it possible ship mining products from Zaire and Zambia, its traffic is intermittent
because of frequent sabotage. During the colonial period, it reached 100,000 tons
a month. According to the South Africans, it has dropped by half.

The transport problem has important effects on the life of the Angolan people.
Certain regions have enough food, while malnutrition reigns in others. In Luanda..
food is rationed and the people spend hours lining up'before the stores. Besides
an improvement in transport, the solution to the problem would be to encourage

the rural world to produce more. It has not been asked to do so because it-would

15

be difficult to offer consumer goods in exchange for the surplus in production.
The burden of the huge bureaucracy undoubtedly hes something to do with this

situation, but even more important is undeniably the state of permanent conflict,
maekcd or not, between Angola and its powerful neighbor to the south.

COUKOUN'I OUEDDEI SAID TO BE (DNSOLIDATINC HIS PNITIONS

Paris JEUNE AFRIQUE in French No 1082. 30 Sep 81 p 36
[Article by S. D.: ”A Prudent Hatch"]

[Text] There is no honeymoon yet, but following the visit of Goukouni Oueddei,
president of the GUNT (Transitional National Union Government) to Paris (16-18
September), one may nevertheless speak of a commitment to a new prudent match

between Chad and France.

This is in the interest of France. for in addition to Chad's mineral resources. said
to be substantial and varied. France is aware of the strategic position of that
country in the heart of the African continent. That is why. regardless of the
vexations it has experienced over the past 15 years or so. it cannot hack out of
playing a role in Ndjamena.

Horn out by the endless quarrels and disagreements of the multiple clans fighting
for power, and harassed by the OAU, President Valery Giscard d' Eataing had finally
pulled the French troops out. However. this pullback looked more like a retreat
than a pure and simple departure. In any case. after leaving Ndjamena. the troops
of the former mother country had found a new base, not too far from the Chadian
border. in Bouar, Central Africa. It was from there that they continued to observe
the development of the Chadian situation, particularly after Colonel Qadhdhafi sent
into the country a 10,000-men strong expeditionary corps in December 1980.

The new French leadership hesitated somewhat before stepping into the Chadian wasps'
nest. However, President Hitterrand was given strong encouragements by many heads
of French-speaking states. He also consulted with and secured the approval in
advance of the Kenyan Arap Moi, the current 0A" chairman. and of Tanzanian President
Julius Nycrere. 0n the OAU level. most heads of state in fact favor the quick
withdrawal of Libyan forces from Chad. They expect of France logistic and financial
support for raising an African intervention force.

This is consistent with GUNT interests, for not only does such an operation make
President Goukouni the only interlocutor on the Chadian political stage but

consolidates his positions on the poJ.itica1. military and diplomatic levels.
ﬂenceforth, this son of the Derdei seems to have ensured Paris' comprehensive
support. It is indeed true that. although lacking any kind of organized military
fo:ce with which to oppose his rivals, he has remained patient and modest while
acting with feline dexterity.

The purpose of the current diplomatic contacts maintained among the GAO, the various
interested African capitals and Paris is to determine the countries which will be
lending troops for Chad, the actual needs of such a force and the nature of French
assistance. Paris has also agreed to provide substantial aid for the rebuilding of
Ndjamena and the resumption of public services (see following report).

Hill Libya allow itself to be ousted? Its expeditionary corps controls the terrain
while the salaries of Chadian officials come from Tripoli. Finally, Colonel
Qadhdhafi enjoys substantial support within the country. All of these are as many
trumps he could play. if not to prevent at least to delay the withdrawal of his
forces. It is true that, far from having vanished, the reasons for their presence
in the country, namely the feeling of insecurity maintained by Hissein ﬂabre's
forces, seem to have accentuated. According to observers, the head of the PAN
(Armed Forces of the North) has reorganized his troops and gained the firm support
of Sudan, Egypt, some Persian Gulf states and undoubtedly the United States.

It is certain that Hissein Habre will keep annoying the GUNT. In any case, the
entire eastern part of Chad, from the Sudanese border to Abeche, going through
Guereda, appears to be on the verge of falling to under hin. The threat is such

that, at the very last moment Acyl Ahmat, GUNT foreign affairs minister, put on the
sackcloth and went to fight in Guereda.

NATION DESCRIBED AS RESUHING NORMAL ACTIVITIES
Paris JEUNE APRIQUE in French No 1082. 30 Sep 81 pp 37-39
[Article by Special Correspondent Sidi Hahamet: "Peaceful Days in Ndjamena"]

[Text] "Camair flight UY 786 to Yaounde, Ngaoundere and Marcus. Passengers will
please go to gate No 3 for immediate embarcation." Brouhaha. Customary pushing in
the small waiting hall for domestic flights at Douala airport in Cameroon. The time
was 0900 and I was on my way to Ndjamena.

Ever since Chad's international airport has been closed to civilian flights it has
been necessary to take the long way around to reach Chad. One can fly to Kano
(Nigeria) and continue by road; go to Tripoli (Libya) and take the Tripoli-Ndjamena
Libyan Airlines flight. as even Chadians living in Europe do; finally, one can go
via Cameroon, on the paved HarouauKousseri road (about 270 km), or cross the Cheri,
which is the natural border between Cameroon and Chad.

The point is that Chad's link with the outside world by road is possible only by
taking the Kousseri-Ndjamena ferry, which makes between 12 and 15 round trips daily
between the banks of the Chari. The ferry consists of cross-pieces linking four
crafts powered by two 35-horsepower engines, and the trip takes 15 minutes. It can
acommodate one heavy truck, a small car and a few passengers with their scooters per
crossing.

An endless line of trucks await their turn for the hypothetical crossing on either
side of the river. Trucks sometimes have to wait as long as 2 weeks before
crossing, for priority is given to medicines and foodstuffs and perishable goods,
including Gala, the domestic beer, which is brewed in Houndou, south of the Chad,
the Ndjamena plant having stopped production. Truckers in a hurry must unload their
goods on the Cameroonian side of the river, from which they are moved to the other
bank by a train of canoes. whose owners have struck gold, even though some big
dealers enjoy a quasi—monopoly. Refugees and the unemployed from Kousseri and
Ndjamena benefit as well.

In Ndjamena I was offered a choice between the Chari and La Tchadienne hotels. I
tried both. The Chari was playing host to the members of an iaportant mission of
the African Development Bank; to Cameroonian teachers. headed by the dean of the
department of literature in Yaounde. in charge of organizing the examinations for
the baccalaureat which, having started on 26 August, were taking place for the first
time after a 3-year interruption; ASECNA representatives, who had come to prepare

19

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

the reapening of the Ndjamena airport, scheduled for the beginning of October; a
Chadian minister and some officials; and several experts from the UN High
Commission for Refugees (HCR). Staying at La Tchadienne were mostly three
representatives from a development company, hoping to be able to resume work
shortly; a transient CPA; Italian, German and Libyan pilots; and a few Chadian
officials.

Neither hotel seemed to have suffered very much from the civil war, although most of
the windows were broken and furniture and even utensils had found their way to
Kousseri. However, the new town and above all the stores and buildings on De Gaulle
Avenue had suffered heavy damage. Also heavily damaged were the old offices of Air
Afrique, the shops of the NSCKN (Nouvelle societe couerciale du Konilou-Niari) and
the International Bank of West Africa. All buildings along the street look as

though suffering from a kind of small-pox. The cathedral has lost all its stained
glass and roofing.

The damage on the way to the airport is equally heavy: the ASECNA cottages have
been totally destroyed; all that remains of the airport terminal are partially
burned walls; the ground telecommunications station was totally destroyed.

In the city, the thermoelectric power plant, which was slightly damaged, is more or
less operational, and Ndjamena has a regular power supply, cut off daily between
1430 and 1730 hours. Virtually all water towers are inoperative, and whereas tap
water reaches the cottages and ground floors of buildings, water is supplied to
higher stories and even to the hotels in buckets.

The prevailing impression from a tour of the city is that initially the antagonists
were equipped exclusively with light weapons (just enough for killing one another),
and that the looting and wrecking which preceded the withdrawal of Hissein ﬂabre's
forces were carefully planned to paralyze the country's administration. The Libyans
appear to have caused practically no damage, having found the area abandoned, as
Hissein Habre and his men vanished. apparently warned by a French messenger from
Kousseri.

The Libyans are very descrete. but their assistance remains substantial and varied:
the exclusive air route between Tripoli and Ndjamena makes ait possible for the
Ilyushin 7a of the Libyan Airlines to supply Chad with items of prime necessity and
rcsupply Qadhdhafi's forces. On their return flight they fly in Chadians wishing to
emigrate to Libya. Furthermore, the government is given a subsidy in order to pay
the salaries of employees and rebuild and start some projects.

However, Tripoli's help alone would be insufficient to ensure economic development
and resettle the refugees. The refugees, which the “CR is in the process of
examining, have started arriving, in Ndjamena mainly, ever since the CWT
(Transitional National Union Government) decreed a general amnesty. More refugees
are expected as a result of the agreement reached between Chad, Cameroon and the
HCR. which confirms the amnesty and the freedom granted the refugees to choose
between returning to Chad or settling in Cameroon. In addition to the census the
“CR will distribute the aid in tools for rebuilding, cooking utensils, blankets,

etc. Those who have opted to stay in Cameroon will be allowed to settle 80 km from
Kousseri.

20
Other UN organizations are already working in Chad in helping the refugees and in
the implementation of the emergency program drafted by the GUNI, specifically the
PAN (Kcrld Food Program) and above all the PNUD, which was the first to answer the
appeal of Chad and the OAU and which signed an agreement for the delivery of aerial
navigation equipment in order to make possible the resumption of day-time traffic at
Ndjamena airport. Other agreements dealing with repairs of water and electric power
systems and the building of a ferry boat will be signed shortly. Other active
agencies are the International Association Against hunger (AICP) and the FED
(European Development Fund). which will also deal with the water and electric power
systems. France has agreed to help in the reconstruction. Perfectly aware of the
“state of geographic isolation, to which is added the political isolation in which
some would like to keep us," President Goukouni Oueddei is increasing the number of
trips and good-will missions of his ministers, particularly those of Ngslgbet
Kosnaye, minister of finance, and Naimbaye Lossimian, minister of state.

The government's action was defined in a general policy document, which was

discussed at the special 20 August meeting and published by the Chad News Agency on
27 August. It includes two main ideas:

"Consolidate our previous gains;

"Get Chad out of its state of isolation by diversifying our relations with all
countries which love peace, justice and independence."

The other key points are:

"The accords concluded between France and Chad will be revised shortly with a view
to reinvigorating our cooperation with that country;

"Bearing in mind the historical, geographic and cultural ties which link us to
Libya, dynamic cooperation between our peoples will be developed on the basis of
reciprocal respect for national independence and territorial integrity....The 6081
will ask for the withdrawal of Libyan forces stationed in Chad."

The trips made by President Goukouni (to France in particular) and the missions sent
abroad (to Senegal. for example) should make it possible to set up an 'ufrican
force" which would replace the Libyan troops; to mobilize aid for the purpose of
reconstruction (missions to the FED and the African Development Bank); give
assurances regarding the country's independence and ask that all support of Hissein
Habre be terminated. On this level, in the next few months the chief of state could
take the initiative of meeting with President Ja'far Numayri (Sudan) and Anwar
al-Sadat (Egypt).

Economic development has first priority, however, and the GUNT has submitted to
international organizations and governments of some countries, France included, a
Memorandum on Emergency Aid to Chad. The amount of emergency aid needed is assessed
at 65.5 billion CFA francs and could reach 68 billion if telecommunications and
other needs are included. Specifically, aid is requested for national defense,
information, public health and social affairs, public education, rural development,
internal affairs and security, economy and finance and the city of Ndjamena.

21

without waiting for such assistance, which is still hypothetical, the CUNT has begun
to work with the help of Libya and the mentioned international organizations. Back
salaries were paid through June 1981. This whipped up all kinds of activities:
buildings are being repaired, roofs laid on. and administrative building repainted;
traffic on the Chari has intensified. Goods are pouring in frol Nigeria and
Cameroon. radio—cassette players are clearly less expensive than those sold in the
best duty—free shops of any airport. Even gasoline in bottles is sold everywhere at
unbeatable prices (125 CPA francs per liter of high-octane). In turn Chad is
exporting mainly cattle: early morning, on the road to Koussery, on the Nigerian
border. herds of cattle stretch for kilometers on end. The rains, which were late
in Ndjamena, were abundant in the south and the rice, millet and wheat crops will be
bountiful. The millct marketplace is once again active until late at night. Hotel
Chari has resumed its dance soirees: "It is like before the war." I was told by a
student who had Just passed (finally!) his baccalaureat tests. Abandoned works and
projects have been restarted. Of the three banks in Ndjamena the BIAT (formerly
BlAO) has reopened its doors in the former residence of the director general. All
that remains for the GUNT to do in order to speed up the recovery is to annul the
moratorium which had frozen bank accounts. Chad is not in debt, and the Central
Bank escaped looting. Officials and personnel. who had ran away because of the war,
are returning to the country. There is a resumption of life everywhere. even in the
country side with the advent of the rainy season. Chad has definitely entered its
post-war period, and all Chadians without exception hope for peace. "We shall deal

with anyone who may try to lead us into another fratricidal struggle," the cadres to
whom I mentioned such a possibility exclaimed.

PRIORITY SECTORS 01" 1982-1986 DEVELOPMENT OUTLINE!)
Paris MARCIiES TROPICAUX ET MEDITERRANEENS in French No 1872, 25 Sep 81 p 21652

[Text] During President Denis Sassou Nguesso's working visit to Paris from

26 to 28 July, the decision was made to organize at the CNPF [National Council of
French Finployers] headquarters on Thursday, 210 September, a "Symposium on the
Congo" chaired by Jean Dromer.

An important governmental delegation was due to present the priority sectors of
the new 1982-1986 Development Plan during that meeting. The delegation consisted
of top civil servants and was headed by Minister of Plan Pierre Mousse, Minister
of Industry and Fishing Jean Itadi and Minister of Mines and Energy Rodolphe Adada.

The main priority sectors of the 1982—1986 Congolese plan which were submitted
by the Congolese delegation as likely to be of particular interest for French
companies were the following:

1) Primary Sector and Industries Connected with that Sector—Agriculture; agro-
industry (cake manufacture, for example); timber industries: samills, carpentry
shops, furniture factories); fishing industry (offshore fishing, inland fishing
and fish farming); infrastructures connected with the fishing industry (expansion
of the port of Pointe-Noire); refrigeration plants.

2) Encrgy-—Transport and distribution lines to carry electrical power into the
hinterland and to establish a genuine interconnection: three hydroelectric power
stations (mini-stations) of between 1 and 2 megawatts in the far north (Ouesso,
itounbi, Seabe); around 60 generating sets in isolated areas; f inally, a power
station (100 megawatts) on the Lefini River: the Iboulou Dan.

3) Water and Drainage Works-«No water plants in Brazzaville (a call for bids
wi.‘ 1. be forthcoming); in Pointe—Noire, a partial solution is in progress. The
problem of the sewage system (used water) will be tackled at. a later date.
however. there are plans to carry out urban projects involving drainage work
(rain water, canalization and repair of gullies running through the capital city).

4) Health-Medical and surgical equipment; projects: in Pointe—ﬂoire (three
hospitals with 200 beds) and in Brazzaville (several hospitals with the same
capacity to be built in the districts of the city).

23

5) Telecommunications--Expanaion of the northern radio link; prolongation of the
southwest radio link; an autononous TV studio in Impfondo since the network does
not reach that far; most likely another studio in Pointe-Noire (as a latching

installation); projects for telephone exchanges and other telephone inproveneuts.

Minister of the Plan Pierre Moussa is at the disposal of any company which may
be interested in some of the aforesaid projects.

CABON‘S ECONOMIC growth and per-
formance is directly related to the
development of its rich natural resources
Its per capital income at $3.000 is one of
the highest in Africa and has been for
some time. The country's basic wealth is
derived from oil. manganese. uranium
and rich timber resources. There are
major iron ore deposits. These have yet to
be developed.

Increasingly. however. Gabon is look-
ing to find replacements for its oil
resources which from now on will be
rapidly depleted. Oil production is cur-
rently at the rate ofIO-million tonsa year
but by the mid-19803 this level Will have

Uranium and manganese are already
being mined in the south-east of the

including the establishment of a Public
Security Ministry as the result of a grow-
ing cnme wave.

Ironically. the causes were in part
ascribed to resentment by unemployed
Gabonais because there are large num-
bers of foreigners in the country who
have Jobs (they have ﬂocked in to take
advantage ofthc country's mineral based
development) when local people often
remain unemployed.

Gabon got on top of its economic prob-
lems during 1980 - a year which saw a
growth rate of 17 per cent. Inﬂation was
only ll per cent. The government suc-
ceeded in reducing foreign debt from a
ratio of 50 per cent of the GDP to 35 per
cent.

This year. government revenues are
expected to increase by 26 per cent while
spending is expected to rise by only 22 per
cent. The overall surplus should increase
the GDP by 10 per cent.

In conventional terms Gabon repres-
ents an economic success story. But
unlike many African countries it posses-
ses the variety of resources to make this
performance possible.
DECREAS? IN MANGANESE PRODUCTION NOTED
Paris MARCHES TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANEENS in French No 1872, 25 Sep 81 p 2652

{Text} On 17 September in Libreville, OOHILOG (Upper Ogooue Mining Company) General
Director Hervouet met with the new Gabonese minister of state for mines, Etienne-

Cuy Nouvagha Tchioba, in order to review the activities of the company.

The general director of COHILOC told the daily newspaper L'UNION at the close of the
meeting that the amount of manganese sold abroad dropped substantially in 1981.

In answer to a question on the way in which COMILOG intended to compensate for this
decline in exports, Hervouet told our colleague that the negative effects would

probably be offset by the increase in the dollar on the international financial
market.

Our plant is operating up to two-thirds capacity, he said, and this concerns the
different ores that we produce. Metal ore represents 90 percent of our sales
abroad. It is used to make the ferroalloy needed to remove the sulfur from steel.
It is in the area of this metal ore that "we are experiencing heavy drops in produc-
tion." For bauxite (about 10 percent of all production), used to make batteries,
the demand is up substantially. That is why, Hervouet said, "we are building a

concentration plant capable ot handling 100 tons of ungraded ore per hour. This
units will- be operational in April 1982, at least on the experimental level."

The newspaper recalls that the production and exportation of manganese at the end of
1980 declined, both because of the reduction in world steel production and improved
yield in the iron and steel industry. leading to a drOp in the rate of use in the
ferro-mannanese sector. This trend continued during the first 6 months of 1981.

Total manganese production during the first 4 months of 1981, compared with the

last 4 months of 1980, is down nearly 50 percent. The spectacular drop in February
and March 1981 (down 80 percent) allegedly results from a halt caused by maintenance
of operating equipment. Consequently, there was no reversal of the trend in April,

the general director concluded, but rather, a resumption of operations at the pre-

vious level. As for exports, the situation is no different and their volume dropped
in analogous proportions (down 53 percent).

OPPOSITZOX TO HALI'S MEMBERSHIP IN UMOA DISCUSSED
Paris JEUNE APRIQUE in French No 1081, 23 Sep 81 pp 26-27
[Article by Sennen Andriamirado: "What Is To Be Done With Mali?"]

{Text} "If Upper Volta dares to engage in that sort of blackmail with us, then Mali
may just give up all negotiations. We shall not return to the CPA franc.“ The
Malian diplomat making the threat is disgusted: At a technical meeting in Dakar on
31 August, an Upper Voltan representative (privately) whispered that Mali's entry
into UMOA (West African Monetary Union, which includes Benin, the Ivory Coast, Upper
Volta, Niger, Senegal and Togo) should be accompanied by a final border agreement
between the two countries. Although it is the petitioner, Mali would be willing,
under such conditions, to give up its membership in UMOA, whose Council of Ministers
meeting scheduled for 24 September in Paris (separately from that of the franc zone
ministers) should draw up the terms.

France immediately reassured Mali and expressed regret over the remark made by the
Upper Voltan representative. Mali bitterly replies: "Discussions with France turn

out to be easier than with some of our partners." This position was confirmed on
10 September in Bamako by Minister of Foreign Affairs Alioune Blondin Beye:
"France's position regarding us is excellent." In other words, Paris wi11 do its
utmost to help Mali enter UMOA and therefore, the BCEAO (Central Bank of the vest
African States), for the monetary "rediscoveries," if one can call them that, be-
tween the former French West African territories were intended by France.

To be blunt, France has grown tired,L over the past 2 years. of being the sole sup-
porters of the perpetually failing Malian economy. Living off of subsidies and
foreign credits (70 percent of all budget receipts), Mali faces multiple problems:
its landlocked geographic position and the nearly chronic drought, naturally, but
in addition. the lack of productivity of government companies and enterprises.

To make it worse, the political climate has long paralyzed any attempt at economic
reform. There can be no question of abandoning the famous national companies, now
considered a "gain of the peopleﬂ'for even if theydidnot produce,they provided
jobs. One had but to pay the wages!

The BCM (Central Bank of Mali, jointly managed with France) advanced the loans to.

the government, which subsidized the companies. In addition, Mali enjoyed an
annual budgetary grant of 1 billion Malian francs, until the end of 1979 when, with-

out previous warning, France turned off the water.

This attitude was immediately considered in Bamako as an attempt to destabilize the
regime of President Mousse Traore, who had to face his most serious crisis in 1980:
irregular wages for government employees, no scholarships for students, a worsening
monetary disorder resulting in a kind of swindle turning against the government,

the BCM and government companies and enterprises. But despite every possible account
ing maneuver, the enterprises. one just as insolvent as the other, could not go on
loaning themselves fictitious sums indefinitely.

OPAM (Malian Agricultural Products Office) alone registered a deficit of 30 billion
Malian francs in 1980 (1 Malian franc . .50 CPA francs). The government's 1981
budget (85.2 billion Malian francs) was drawn up with a deficit of 6.6 billion
Malian francs which this time, the BCM could not make up: Its advances to the
government already amount to 100 billion Malian francs, in addition to what is owed
from secondary banks and government enterprises (some 47 billion francs). A "milk
cow." the BCM itself owes over 100 billion Malian francs to the Bank of France,
whence the French pressure to bring Mali into UMOA and thereby share the Malian

burden with the BCEAO.

But joining UMOA (and therefore, the BCEAO) presumes certain conditions, first of
all, the rehabilitation of the DOM books, which the BCEAO does not want to inherit:
excessively heavy debts to France, fictitious debts to the Malian Government and
national enterprises.

The recommended solution: Since France, the main creditor and co-manager of the
BCM, wants to push Mali into EMOA, let it then assume certain debts, even wipe the

Malian "slate" clean. That is the hope which the latest discussions with the
Mitterrand government created in the minds of the Malians.

The second technical condition which Mali should meet within UMOA: the monetary
discipline requiring that every member state receive advances from the common
Central Bank only in the amount of 30 percent of their regular fiscal receipts.
This is a rather disturbing prospect for the Malian Government, which already owes

its own bank more than the total amount of its annual budget (including debts and
deficits).

The third conditions which some or its future partners.erect as an obstacle to
Mali's membership: There can be no question of simply replacing Malian bills

with CPA bills, for that would be the same thing as revaluing the Malian franc,
which since the 1967 devaluation (return to the franc zone) has been worth only
half of the CPA franc. Por Mali, however, it is a double question of principle:

0n the one hand, the 1967 devaluation, imposed by France, is still viewed in Bamako
as a political humiliation.

Furthermore, and above all, the Malians know very well that the weakness of their
currency has always helped their neighbors, some of which organize veritable govern-
ment trafficking on the borders in order to use CPA francs to buy Malian dried fish,
Malian herds, Malian grains, whose deficit (62,000 tons in 1980) would not be so
great if the millet were not diverted elsewhere. As early as 1968, the drain repre-
sented 50 percent of total-exports. The proportion has steadily increased since
that time. ~

In addition. the monetary orthodoxy wielded by certain interlocutors is not always
exempt from ulterior motives, it is rumored in Mali. Upper Volta in particular,
according to one Malian diplomat, "has been concocting that high-level blackmail

for a year in order to force us to sign an agreement to resolve the border conflict"
which, at the end of 1974, engendered a ”war of the poor" between the two countries
in the Sikasso region (southeast Mali). In Bamako, it is maintained that "this
conflict has nothing to do with UMOA. He shall settle it bilaterally, but that
does not mean that we shall ratify the Upper Voltan position."

Another partner, Togo, also feels some rancor toward Mali, which (alone with Guinea-
Bissau and Cape Verde) has refused to sign the BCOWAS (Economic Community of West
African States, which includes the 16 West African nations) pact proposed by
President chassingbe Eyadema. But the Togolese do not prone financial orthodoxy

too loudly: In order to pay their foreign debts, they themselves have long sought
(unsuccessfully) advances from the BCEAO, the amount of which is between 40 and

60 percent of their own receipts. If Mali, once admitted to UMDA, should obtain

a waiver of the 30-percent ceiling, Togo would view it as a precedent from which it
would in turn benefit.

Another country favorable to Mali's candidacy is also secretly waiting - according
to the Malians - to take advantage of the contagion: Senegal, which cannot re-
proach Bamako for the bankruptcy of its national enterrrises when it is itself
having difficulty straightening out the finances of its own organizations. For
this reason, Senegal appears to be one of the firm defenders of the "Malian
brother."

But Mali's main advocate is the Ivory Coast. For political reasons this time,
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny wants to avoid throwing Mali into the arms of the
Soviet Union and its progressive allies in the region once and for all. Enclosed
within their borders, the Malians might be tempted to strengthen relations with
the USSR, which has already strongly equipped their army. This is a prospect
which the lvorian president. an inveterate anti-Soviet, could not accept on his
borders.

Consequently, for a year, Mali has been tightening its bonds with its big neighbor
in the north. Algeria, whence the minister of finance and commerce returned to
Bamako on 5 September, saying: "Algeria and Mali must do everything to raise the
level of their (commercial) trade, which is currently very modest, to that of the
exemplary political cooperation that exists between the two countries."

Mali's financial fate must therefore be decided during this month of September with
its partners in French-speaking West Africa and France. It is believed in Bamako
that this statement sounds like a warning: If our immediate brothers do not want
us, then we will find other brothers.

INF AGREES TO SUPPORT STATB'S STABILIZATION PLAN
Paris MARCBES TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANEENS in French No 1872; 25 Sep 81 pp 2637, 2638

[Text] On 16 September, the International Monetary Fund approved a stand-by agree-
ment authorizing Senegal to purchase up to 63 million special drawing rights [808]
until June 1982 to support the stabilization program of the Senegalese Government.
This cancels the agreement signed in August 1980 with the IMP. Senegalese drawings
under this new agreement will be partially financed by the IHF's ordinary reaources
(29.4 million $033) and partially by remaining funds (33.6 million) out of the out-
standing balance of the August 1980 agreement.

Added to this, the IMF has authorized Senegal to draw an additional 42 million SDRs
as part of compensatory financing for the decline of Senegalese exports over a 12-
month period ending in June 1981. This decline is due to a drop of almost 60 per-
cent in the country's earnings from its peanut crop as a result of the drought.

Over the last 20 years, the IMF points out, the Senegalese economy has known a

slow and uneven growth. Since 1978, this trend became more marked due to adverse
climatic conditions affecting agricultural exports, to the deteriorating terms of
exchange and to a policy of credit expansion. All these factors have created nega-
tive rates of growth, a bigger balance of payments deficit and accelerated inflation.
To face this situation, the authorities adopted in mid-1980 a mid-term program of
structural adjustment based on using resources from the IMF which were expected

to bring the balance of payments back to an acceptable level and to restart eco-
nomic growth. However, the results obtained during the first year of that program
fell far below its expectations, mainly as a result of having a bad farming year.

This is why the Senegalese Government has decided, as a first step, to launch with
the assistance of the IN! a new program, a short-term program this time, which is
expected to noticeably reduce the balance of payments' deficit. In the context of
this program, the government will adopt measures which are likely to improve and
increase its basic revenues, to restrict the growth of ordinary expenditures in
nominal terms, to reduce the budget deficit and to channel investments toward im-
mediately productive sectors. The measures adopted include a higher value added

tax and an increase in the prices of oil products and electricity. The government
also plans to set out consolidated accounts for all its transactions and to control
the outstanding debts of public and quasi-public sectors so as to reduce these debts.

It should be noted that the quota allowed to Senegal by the IMF is 63 million SDRa
and that this country's financial obligations with the Fund stand today at 72.6
million SDRs.

INTERMINISTERIAL MEETING DEVOTED T0 FARMING, STOCKRAISING
Paris MARCHBS TROPICAUX ET HEDITBRRANEBNS in French No 1872: 25 Sep 81 p 21938

[Text] An interministcrial meeting, held on 17 September, adopted a number of
measures in connection with the farming season, stockraising and truck farming.

Farming Season--The monopoly held by SONACOS [National Marketing Company of Senegal],
$318 [the 3.101 Electrical and Industrial Company] and SONAR [National Company for
the Supply of Oil Hills] in the marketing of the peanut crop was confirmed and will
be protected. This monopoly was broken in the preceeding farming year when the
amount of peanuts harvested fell below what was expected. The head of state has
asked that credit disruptions be avoided in the future. To this end, the advance
credits given at the beginning of the farming season should amount to 35 percent in
all areas and 50 percent in the frontier areas of Sine-Saloum. Eastern Senegal and

Casamance.

The meeting asked that the marketing of grains and beans be started on 1 October
and the marketing of peanuts on 2 November. It also set the following prices for
seeds, per kilo, in CPA francs and at the weighing time: 76.5 and 73.5 for peanuts;
55 for millet; 53 for sorghum: 80 for hybrid corn; S3 for ordinary corn; 80 for
beans; 59.5 for rainy-season rice and 61.5 for irrigated rice.

Truck Farming--The aim is to make sure that the country is self-sufficient in onion
production, by using varieties which keep longer, and in potatoes, thus reducing
imports by 1.5 billion CPA francs. To this end, the minister of economy and finances
will unfreeze crop credits after consultation with the National Development Bank of
Senegal (BNDS) and will make these credits available to SONAR and for the trained
personnel of irrigated areas. The required priority will then be given to expanding
the Baobad area by 150 hectares and to making full use of the existing 600 hectares
of developed area. .

The prime minister will also adopt all the necessary measures, in cooperation with
the ministers concerned, to encourage without wasting any time the expansion of
truck farming devoted to cash crops wherever this is possible and to immediately
start a project to settle young farmers in the Niayes region.

Stockraising--To encourage cattlemen to make hay, the minister of rural development
will give them assistance in that sphere. The grazing areas are in good condition
and are expected to provide good food for the stock which looks good and healthy.

[Text] Cement prices have registered a noticeable increase in Senegal since 8
September and the price of cement leaving the SOOOCIH [West African Cement Company]
plant rose from 22,563 CPA francs a ton to 29.722 CPA francs, with taxes included.
This price is broken down as follows: 23,935 CPA francs represents the sale price
before taxes to which are added 19,787 francs for value added tax (VAT) and 1,000
francs of special tax. This increase followed the publication of the Decree No
81.879 of 1 September 1981 giving approval to an agreement between the Government
of the Republic of Senegal and 800001)! Industries signed on 11 August 1981.

This agreement, which SOCOCIH had been waiting to sign for months, allows the con-
psny, among other things, to pass on to their sale price the higher costs incurred

over the last 18 months.

Since January this year, the company was losing money heavily by selling cement

at prices below the production cost. As a result of this, and during the last few
months, sococm merely kept its plants in good order. The cement price adjustment
should enable the company to start work on inportant expansion projects which are
scheduled to be carried out over the next 30 months.

The project to expand the cement plant is one of the items included in the agree-
ment signed between the Senegalese Government and the 500001“ Industries. Based
on the results of studies conducted on the subject, the expansion project is in-
tended to use the aethod of precalcination. To do this, it will be necessary to
make changes in the largest furnace of the $0000!!! plant, a move which will result
in considerably lower eneryyconsumption and nuch higher production. Production is
expected to increase from 360,000 tons a year to 825,000 tons.

The cost of this expansion project is 18 billion CPA francs. It will be financed
by international agencies (Central Fund for Economic Cooperation, European Invest-
ment Bank), by local banks and others. Therefore, in 30 months fron now, 800001!!—

a company which has been entirely Senegalese since 1978—wi11 have more than doubled
its production capacity and will considerably increase its productivity.

PRESIDENT '5 FRENCH VISIT—President Nyerere has just been to Paris where he met
with President Mitten-and and with the first secretary of the Socialist Party.
Lionel Jospin. At a press conference given in Paris, on 15 September, President
Nyerere said that he was convinced that the new French Government will not try to
establish "neocolonialist relations" with some African countries as he claims that
previous regimes did. Speaking about his talks with President Mitterrand, he
declared: "We had useful and direct talks" and he noted that theirs was a meeting
between "two socialists." 0n the subject of the situation in southern Africa and,
more particularly, the South African operation in Angola, Nyerere said that he
was pleased with France's attitude. The Tanzanian president, who mentioned that
Cuban troops came to Angola to counteract "the South African intervention carried
out with external connivance," thinks that those troops will no longer be needed
when Namibia becomes independent. Asked about the United Nations Conference on
LDC's (Less Developed Countries), recently held in Paris, Nyerere considers that
it represents a first step which can be described as being "a success" even if the
parties concerned would have liked to see more firm constituents. 0n the subject
of the forthcoming summit in Cancun, the Tanzanian president said that "France's
stance will be very useful for the Third Horld." [Text] [Paris HARCHES TROPICAUX

ZAMBIA

MINISTER FORECASTS EXCELLENT CROP YEAR
Paris MARCHES TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANBBNS in French No 1872. 25 Sep 81 p 2‘55

[Text] The Zambian minister of agriculture and water development, Unis Mwila,
recently predicted that this year's corn crop will register a 100 percent increase
and will amount to about 11 million bags.

The minister also announced that Zambia's production of wheat should amount to
11,818 tons this year, an increase of 2,137 tons or 22 percent over the previous
farming season. By next year, the farmers' selling price will go up to 32 kwachas
for a bag of 91 kilos as opposed to 26 kwachas which is the price this year.

The Zambian Government has also taken steps to encourage tobacco growing. In

the 1981-1982 crop year, the price paid to the farmers will go up to 2.40 kwachas
as opposed to 1.65 kwachas in the 1980—1981 season. This represents a 45 percent
increase. Tobacco growers will be given foreign currency allowances equivalent

to 5 percent of their gross earnings without including the first 5 tons of tobacco.
The government wants farmers who have abandoned tobacco growing to go back to
planting that crop. It has decided to encourage these farmers because tobacco
crops require a large labor force.

But the prospects of good crops should not raise false hopes. In the case of corn,
in particular, one needs canvas covers and trucks to protect the crops and bring
them to the consumer. Zambia's lack of foreign currency threatens to have serious
effects on the agriculture and the government is currently trying to get some
action from its friends abroad to save the crops. According to Zambian Prime
Minister Hundia, between 5 and 6 million bags of corn, or half of the expected
crop, are in danger of being ruined by the rain for lack of adequate storage
facilities. By 28 August, before the rainy season started, the NAHBOARD [expansion
unknown] had purchased 5.3 million bags from the farmers but only 3.5 million bags
had been transported to the storage facilities.
