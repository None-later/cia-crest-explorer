2.1. structure of the Core

The W nuclear power reactor is a heterogeneous thermal neutron channel-type
reactor in which graphite is used as the moderator. The coolant-boiling light
water-circulates through vertical channels that penetrate the lining of the core.
This type of reactor is the latest develop-ant of uraniurgrsphite reactors in the
USSR.

The core has the shape of a vertical cylinder 11.8 asters in diameter and 7 meters
high. It is surrounded by a lateral reflector 1 meter thick and end reflectors 0.5
meter thick. The core contains the fuel elements. moderator. coolant, fuel channels
and neutron absorber rods (control rods) (Iigure 2.1).

The graphite stacking of the reactor is 2, 488 vertical colms which were assem-
bled from blocks 250 x 250 mm in cross section with graphite density of 1. 65 g/cm3.
The blocks have oblique openings 114 mm in diameter along the vertical axis that
are designed for location of the fuel channels and the monitoring and control chan-
nels. Graphite rods are installed in the openings of four rows of the peripheral
columns (the side reflector).

The fuel channels are located in 1.693 cells of the square lattice of the core.
Part of the channel located in the core is made of a zirconium alloy and is a pipe
88 In in diameter with wall thickness of 4 m. Graphite rings are placed on the
pipe to ensure thermal contact with the stacking blocks. The fuel assembly, which
is two series-connected fuel assemblies (TVS) 3.5 meters long each, is installed
inside the channel. The design gap between the TVS comprises approximately 20 mm.
The TVS consists of 18 fuel rods which are attached by steel spacing lattices on a
central pipe manufactured of zirconium alloy measuring 15 X 1.25 In. either a car-
rier rod 12 In in diameter or a carrier pipe of zirconium alloy measuring 12 x 2.5
mm passes inside it. The fuel element is a pipe with outer diameter of 13.5 In with
wall thickness of 0.9 mm of zirconium alloy filled with pellets 11.5 use in disaster
of uranium dioxide with density up to 10.5 g/cm3 and with enrichment of 1.8 or 2
percent 0-235. The inner cavity of the fuel element is filled during manufacture
with a mixture of argon and helium and is sealed by cathode-ray welding. Addition-
a1 absorbers (DP) are installed in part of the fuel channels in the initial state.

The coolant is delivered to the bottom to each fuel channel. The economizer sec-
tion of the channel in which water is heated to saturation telperature is approx-
imately 2.5 meters high from the bottom of the core. The active boiling process
occurs in its remaining part wherein the mass steam content of the coolant in-
creases along the flow and conprises an average of 14.5 percent throughout the re-
actor at the output from the core.

The monitoring and control system channels are located identically to the fuel
channels in the central openings of the graphite stacking coluuns. The square lat-
tice for location of the 179 rods has spacing of 700 mm and is rotated by 45' with
respect to the lattice of the fuel channels. The $02 rods are functionally divided
into groups that ensure radial control of the energy release field (the RR rods),
automatic regulation of the mean power level (AR), screening of a chain reaction
(A2) and regulation of the energy release field in height (USP). The rods of the
first three groups are removed upward from the core and the shortened absorbing
rods of the fourth group are removed downward.

The channel for the $02 rods is made of the same zirconiu: alloy as the fuel chan-
nel but has diameter of 88 m with wall thickness of 3 mm. Graphite rings are also
placed on the outside of the channel. The absorbing rods are assembled from sec-
tions of the same type, articulately connected to each other. The absorbing sec-
tion has a sleeve design. Boron carbide sleeves masuring 65 x 7.5 an and with
total thickness of 984 m are enclosed in a sealed annular cavity formed by the
outer pipe measuring 70 x 2 mm and by the inner pipe measuring 50 x 2 um, the lat-
ter of which is manufactured from aluainua alloy. The RR. AR and A2 rods are as-
senbled from five absorbing sections and have a total length of 5.120 new the USP
are asseubled from three sections with total length of 3,050 In.

a self-contained water circuit with pup-heat exchange unit is used to cool the
channels and the rods. Water moves in the channels from top to bottom and flows
around the outer and inner surfaces of the absorbing rod jackets. being heated from
so to 60°C. The inner cavity of the channels in an operating reactor is filled
with water regardless of the location of the rods. with the exception of the All
rods. all the rods have displacers consisting of five sections articulately con-
nected to each other with total length of 5.000 mm. The displacer section is a
pipe measuring 74 x 2.5 an of elusinus alloy with sealed end caps. One section is
hollow and the remaining sections are filled with sleeves and cylindrical graphite
blocks. when the absorbing rod is removed from the effective zone of the core, the
displacer is introduced into this zone and the neutron balance is improved due to
displacement of part of the water which is a strong absorbent. The AR rod differs
from the RR and AZ rods by the fact that it has no displaoer and a plate 20 In in
diameter is installed in the lower part of the absorbing assembly to distribute the
flow rate of the cooling water. One-third of the total coolant flow rate through
the channel passes through the inner cavities of the AR rods, the same as in the RR
and A2 rods.

The neutron fuel distribution through the core is monitored by a physical monitor-
ing system (Sim). Seven-section B-emission monitoring sensors are located behind
the energy release fields in height in 12 channels uniformly distributed in the
central part of the core for this purpose. The B-emission sensors which are in-
stalled in sealed cavities of the central carrying pipes of the fuel assemblies of
the 117 fuel channels. are used to monitor the energy release distribution to the
reactor radius. Fission chambers, which are used to monitor the neutron flow when
the reactor is started up, are arranged in four channels located in the peripheral
row of the come.

There are 20 vertical Openings 45 mm in diameter. in which channels with three-
zone thersocouples are installed to monitor the graphite temperature, in the re-
actor stacking in the assemblies where the graphite blocks are joined. A total of
156 channels is provided in the central openings of the peripheral row of the '
graphite colms to cool the reflector. Water of the self-contained control system
circuit is used as a cooling medium in these channels and also in 12 channels with
height energy release monitoring sensors and four channels with fission chambers.

2.2. The Method of Neutron Physical Calculation

The smut reactor was developed on the experience of design and many years of oper-
ation of channel-type uranium-graphite reactors of the world's first AES [Nuclear
power plant], the sibirskaya ass and the Beloyarskaya ABS imeni I. V. Kurchstov.
merefore. the methods of neutron-physical calculation checked in existing reactors
were the basis for developing the method of neutron-physical calculation of the
W reactor. At the same time, due to orientation toward continuous recharging
of the working channer and some design features of the am reactor, supplements
to the existing methods and in some cases development of new methodical solutions
were required. One can distinguish three main phases in development of the methods
of calculating the m reactor:

a) working out the physical concept of the motor and analysing its main

neutron-physical characteristics on the basis of traditional methods of calculat-
ing uranim-grsphite reactors;

leakage beyond the cell are determined in the program. The fuel and noderator tem-
perature is determined in the corresponding program blocks. Besides the main ver-
sion, the program has several modificatcnsx calculation of a single-row lattice,

thermal neutrons leak beyond the cell. Neutron capture in the epithermal energy

cott cross-section system is used in this case. Neutron flow is calculated in P1-
approximation for the model of a two-zone cell. The thermal neutron flux distri-

'rhe GE heterogeneous program that takes into account epithermal effects. The most
cannon method of calculating the characteristics of a heterogeneous lattice of
working channels is the heterogeneous method (l, 2!. In the classical heterogene-
ous method the reactor is regarded as a system of working channels placed into a
moderating udim, while channels of finite dimensions are regarded as filamentary
sources of fast neutrons and sinks for thermal and resonance neutrons. The ele-
mentary diffusion equation is used to describe diffusion of thermal neutrons be-
tween channels. The absorbing properties or the channels are characterized by the
logarithm derivative of the thermal neutron flux to the channel surface.

Application of the classical heterogeneous method to calculations of modern power
reactors is very difficult. First, the channel volume comprises a significant
part of the cell value so that the assumption of their filamentary nature leads
to an appreciable error. Second, a considerable umber of neutrons is slowed down
inside the channel, as a result of which it is a source not only of fast. but of
thermal neutrons as well. Moreover, a considerable part of the neutrons is ab-
sorbed and generated in the epithermal energy zone in power reactors with high
uranium burnup with acculmlation of isotopes having cross-sections with high reso.
nance integrals. Modification of the heterogeneous nethod, that permits one to
take into account the indicated characteristics of the channel lattice, has the
arbitrary name 62. The breeding coefficient and the neutron flux distribution
through the cell channels with periodicity having a maximum of 16 heterogeneous
channels can be calculated by the GE program. The 63 progran is used as a block in
the program for calculating the fuel burmp of the channel lattice with regard to
the height heterogeneity of properties.

The heterogeneous burnup calculating program. The method of calculating fuel burn-
up in a channel-type reactor operating in the continuous recharging mode (with het-
erogeneous core) is based on two assmptions. ﬁrst. the structure of the core
charge and the sequence of recharging the working channels are assured such that
the core is a periodic lattice of fuel channels with different fuel burnup, the
main repeating element of which is the feed-rate cell (or macrocell). A nacrocell
consisting of 14 fuel channels and two control channels is usually considered when
calculating an am reactor. This asstmption simplifies calculation of the neutron
fields through the nacrocell, but it is suspected in this case that the considered
macrocells are located in an energy release distribution plateau (or the reactor is
infinitely large in radius). Second, it is assuud that the macroscopic constants
of the fuel channels are determined only by the extent of fuel burnup in a given
channel and are not dependent on the properties of adjacent channels. In this case
calculation of burnup in a heterogeneous system is broken down into two independent
parts:

a) calculation of the macroscopic properties of fuel channels as a function of
the degree of fuel burnup;

b) calculation of power distribution through the macrooell, consisting of dif-
ferent channels whose properties are determined in the first part of the
calculation.

The 63 program is used in the latter part as the main block. The power distribu-
tion obtained in this manner is assumed to be fined during a given time step, which
can be selected as sufficiently snail. This separation of burmp calculation per-
units one to significantly reduce the calculating time since the channel properties
are not calculated directly in the second part but only a seaple is taken from the
properties.

The capability of distinguishing \p to eight zones in height (the HINDI Program) is
provided in the program to take into account the inhomogeneity of the fuel channel
properties in height that results from variation of the coolant density, nonuniform

fuel burnup or variable fuel charge through the length of the channel. The neutron
flux distribution is calculated in single-group approximation. The program takes

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

into account variation of the core charge structure according to one of the channel
recharging schemes and the determined reactor operating modes, for erample, when
the multiplication factor decreases below a given value or when other conditions
are fulfilled: upon reaching a given degree of burnup and with channel output. It
is sufficiently universal and permits one to investigate different fuel charges of
channel-type reactors. Unlike the van program the real structure of the reactor
feed-rate cell and the presence of nonmultiplying channels in the lattice are taken
into account in it. The limitations of the program capabilities are related to
representation of the core in the form of a set of identical macrocells and with
the assumption of constant coolant density distribution during the run through the
height of the channel, although the nature of the energy release distribution var-
ies considerably, especially during the initial period of reactor operation.

Programs for two~dimensional calculation of a reactor. The development of computer
technology considerably expanded the capabilities of realizing calculating methods
which could not be accomplished previously. Attention was primarily devoted to
those problems of reactor calculation which had been hardly investigated, specif-
ically, on calculation of the energy release distribution through the entire reac-
tor. The experience of operating the reactors of the Beloyarskaya ABS indicates
that, unlike uranium-graphite reactors operating on natural uranium, local surges
of energy release determined by the local inhomogeneities of the core structure can
occur in reactors with slightly enriched fuel. A program for two-dimensional cal-
culation (in x-y configuration) of the energy release fields was developed for the
H-220 computer for reactors of the Beloyarskaya ass with approximately 1.000 chan-
nels [3]. The nunerical method of calculating the criticality and the energy re-
lease distribution used in it was realized in two-dimensional programs for up to
3,000 channels with the appearance of the DESK-6 computer. The 3010! program was
used extensively to process the results of physical startup of the reactor and to
form a full charge. The son-c032 program [4] is now used as the operating program
for calculating the energy release fields after introduction of additional units
into the program that take into account nonuniform contamination of the fuel with
xenon and fuel burnup.

Solution of a system of two-group diffusion equations for a reactor consisting of
various types of square cells is realized in the DOM! program. The physical prop-
erties are constant inside each cell. The assemblies of the calculating grid coin-

cide with the centers of the channels. Upon comparison of the calculated and ex-
perimental data, it was shown that this arrangement of assemblies was more
preferable than in the angles of elementary cells of the reactor as was used in
[3]. The iteration process, in which the neutron source distribution and the new
neutron flux distribution of the first and second groups are taken into accomt as
a result of sequential bypass of all the assemblies of the calculating grid on the
basis of given initial single neutron flux distribution in each energy group and
for the initial value of the multiplication factor equal to one, was used to solve
the system of diffusion equations. The next iteration was then carried out using
the neutron fluxes found as a result of the previous iteration. The new value of
the multiplication factor is calculated after each iteration.

This iteration scheme is one with ”mixed” iterations in which, mlike the classi-

cal scheme with external and internal iterations. the neutron sources are correc-
ted after each iteration rather than after some approximation of the neutron flux

for them. This scheme was convergent and convenient by the rate of calculation.
The method of sequential Yong and trankel overrelaxation used to accelerate the
convergence of internal iterations in the classical scheme. was used to reduce
the calculating time.

The presence of control rods and other nonbreeding channels in the core is taken
into account by assigning the corresponding homogenized properties of cells in
which these absorbers are located. Partially inserted rods are replaced by fully
inserted rods equivalent to the first ones in efficiency.

a method of heterogeneous calculation of a reactor that extends the classical het-
erogeneous method to reactor systems having a large number of calls up to 2,500)
was deveIOped in [5, 6]. A heterogeneous reactor is represented in the form of a
finite lattice of thin rods (channels) in a infinite actuator. Neutron transport
in the moderator is described by two-group diffusion equations of the Galinin-
Peinberg type using the quasi-albedo method. Two-dimensional diffusion equations
with file-entary sourcesusinksnare approximately rewritten in a form similar to
the finite-difference method. To do this, the reactor is covered with a square
grid equal to the spacing of the lattice so that the sink-sources are located only
at its points.

The QUM program (its subsequent modifications are NBWQUMI and gum-2), which pere
nits calculation of the energy release distribution to the channels of a reactor
whose core is inscribed into a square with side of not more than 48 cells. was com-
piled by the indicated method. The manner of different varieties of rods (channels)
does not exceed 99. There is the capability of assigning individual characteris-
tics for each channel; linear interpolation is made for all channel parameters when
determining the dependence of properties on burnup.

It was shown upon comparison of the results of calculation by the son and 90»!
programs that both programs yields sufficiently close energy release distribution
through the reactor channels.

The programs used in physical calculations. Without dwelling on the characteristics
of the prograss, let us present a list of the names and designation of prograas used
in making physical calculations of the am reactor and intended for making tradi-

tional reactor calculations.

The SI-S, 193-15 and F 3-50 are progress for solving the single-speed kinetic equa-
tion in P3-approximation. They are used to calculate the thersal neutron flux dis-

2.3. Physical Experiments

The complexity of the core structure of a reactor operating in the continuous re-
charging made, the presence of channels with significantly different breeding, ab-
sorbing and moderating properties and the large dimensions of the core made full-
scale experiments essentially impossible due to their high cost and mainly due to
the long periods required to conduct them--development of a full-scale bench, manu-
facture of channels, assemblies and so on. However, the need for an experimental
check and refinement of the methods of calculating comlex lattices was clear.
Therefore, experiments were conducted during the period of working out the design
on an insert of an already existing graphite bench the spacing of the channel lat-
tice in the insert was equal to the design spacing and comprised 25 a: and the
number of channels was 81; the height of the investigated systems was 3.5 meters,
i.e., it was one-half the design height. The experimental data were used to correct
the calculating methods and to analyse the characteristics of the reactor.

Experiments to determine the characteristics of complex lattices were conducted in
phases-4mm simple to complex. homogeneous lattices of malt—type TVS consisting

of rod fuel elements of uraniua dioxide with natural 0-235 content were investigated
during the first phase. The lattice multiplication parameters and also the neutron
fields in the cell were measured. It was shown in these experiments that the sys-
tem cannot be critical for an ”MK-type lattice when using uranium dioxide of natur-
al enrichment. Therefore, further experiments with natural uranim were conducted
in a subcritical assembly surrounded by a seed region. The experiments were con-
ducted at 25°C with a dry zone and one filled with water. The positive nature of
reactivity upon dehydration of the TVS channel lattice was show. .

sured and the degree of increase of neutron flux density was determined due to the
structural rupture of fuel through the core height between TVS. It was shown that
this surge drops rapidly as the distance from the channel axis increases so that
introduction of a displacer in the center of the TVS leads to appreciable equaliza-
tion of the neutron field through the daannel radius. The results of measurements
made with assemblies of 18 fuel elements with two percent fuel enrichment are pre-
sented in Table 2.1. The gap between the fuel in the fuel elements comprised 41 m
along the vertical and the material of the and parts was SAV alloy. Analysis of
experimental data made it possible to conclude that the surge of energy release on
the peripheral fuel element. of fresh TVS of the M reactor comprises 35-40

percent in the operating state and decreases exponentially as the distance fro-
the gap increases with relaxation length of 1.3 and.

Besides experiments with homogeneous lattices. experiments were conducted with
mixed lattices which were assembled from assemblies of two percent and natural
enrichment. The mixed lattices were formed of polycells which were squares con-
sisting of four channels. The types of investigated lattices and the results of
determining their materials parameters ‘2 with and without water in the fuel chan-
nels are presented in Table 2.2.

Coaparison of the values of :2 for the considered lattices with and without water
in the fuel channels showed that the effect of variation of reactivity upon dehy-
dration of the channels is negative for a lattice containing a two percent enrich-
nent asseuzbly and positive for the other investigated types of lattices. with
average enrichment of 1.7-1.8 percent 0-235 through the posyoell, the effect of
dehydration is close to zero. due to the dependence of a. on the average enrich-
ment, it was concluded that the ninimn enrichment at which a cold nonpoisoned
reactor with water in the fuel channels can be made critical comprises approxi-
mately 1.2 percent.

As one would expect, the neutron spectrum in lattices with enriched fuel is more
rigid compared to that in a spectrum of assemblies containing natural uranium.
Filling the fuel channels with water leads to significant spectra softening and
variation of the neutron field through the assembly, especially for fuel elements
of the outer ring in which the neutron density increases by 15-20 percent. The ex-
cess of effective neutron temperature at the cell boundary over graphite tenperatute

through all fuel elements. increased by 3 and 5 percent when the channel was filled
with water for channels with natural and enriched fuel, respectively, but did not
exceed 1.1 in a single case. The dependence of DP effectiveness on the ratio of
sleeves of two percent boride steel (‘heavy‘ sleeve) and ordinary steel ("light'
sleeves) was studied experimentally in different systems, but mainly with and with-
out water in fuel channels having W8 and in DP channels. The fraction of epitherm-
al absorption n - (“Peg/(OBS + pop) for DP in a channel without water was equal to
3.0 percent for a l ht DP. depending on the ratio of heavy and light sleeves; it
was 1- -5 percent for DP with ratio of heavy to light sleeves of 3 and was 8 percent
for heavy DP. Here on; and Cup are the effectiveness of absorption in the epi-
thermal and thermal regions of the spectrum, respectively. Taking the sleeve de-
sigh of the DP into account, the effect of internal water on the absorptivity of
the DP was investigated, which showed that the internal water increases the effi-
ciency of the DP. For example, the efficiency of a heavy DP increases by 13 per-
cent with the presence of internal water. Thus, the experiments showed that effi-
ciency decreases, all things being equal, when the DP is dehydrated and. it
confirmed the feasibility of introducing an internal almimn displacer.

Experiments on the effect of an outer water layer on the compensating capability
of a DP with internal alminum displacer showed that a layer of water around the
DP decreases its efficiency by lo percent. This result is true of both a heavy DP
and of a DP having boride and ordinary sleeve ratio of 1:1. However, if the chan-
nel with absorbent consisting only of light sleeves is filled with water, its
efficiency is increased.

The same experiments were conducted with absorbing rods similar to reactor control
rods having boron carbide as the absorbent. The experiments showed that the pres-
ence of water inside the rod increases its efficiency by approximately 5 percent,
while the outer layer of water considerably reduces its compensating capability.
Thus, the efficiency of the rod is reduced by approximately 5 percent with layer
thickness of 2 am, by 9 percent with thickness of 4 m and by 13 percent with
thickness of 6 III. The fraction of epithermal absorption with water inside the
rod comprises 18-20 percent.

It should be noted that all the experimental data were found in small critical
assemblies which only simulated the different fragments of a full reactor charge
and different conditions for a cold nonpoisoned reactor. Therefore. they were
used to check and correct the calculating methods.

2.4. Neutron-Physical Calculating maractarietics
2.4.1. Main Periods of nsactor Operation

The neutron-physical characteristics of the M reactor were calculated for three
nain operating periods: The first phase of reactor operation with initial charge.
the so-called transient period which precedes the steady recharging mode and the
steady continuous fuel recharging mode. Each of the indicated periods has its own
specific direction. The reactor should have the best engineering and economic in-
dicators that ensure cometitiveness cospared to electric power plants of other
types in the steady fuel recharging mode. The initial reactor charge should pro-
vide dependable compensation of the initial excess reactivity of the fresh fuel
with optimum engineering and economic indicators. The transient period is charac-
terized by continuous variation of the core structure and its neutron-physical
characteristics. The Iain calculated neutron-physical characteristics of the we:
reactor and their variation as a function of the reactor operating period are con-
sidered below.

2.4.2. The Initial Reactor marge

Versions of accomplishing the initial charge and the passage of the transient per-
iod were considered: reducing the fuel enrichment in the assemblies of the initial
charge, using assemblies with different fuel enrichment. incomplete core charge and
so on. One or another version was selected on the basis of the neutron-physical,
heat engineering, economic and dynamic investigations of the core and of the in-
stallation as a whole. Problems of optimizing the initial fuel charge are consid-
ered in more detail in [7-9]. the main results of which are presented in Table 2.3.
Different compositions of the periodicity cell consisting of 16 cells, including
two 802 channels. are presented in it.

It follows from Table 2.3 that the local sisalignment of channel output in the
periodicity cell for all versions except version 2 appreciably exceeds the corre-
sponding value equal to 1.25 for a steady reactor operating mode. This means that
for the thermal loads not to exceed the values used for the steady mode the reactor
should operate at reduced power for some time. The same thing can be noted with
regard to nonuniformity of the field in height. The coefficient of axial energy
release nonuniformity not exceeding the value in the steady mode, in which the en-
ergy release is equalized in height as a result of fuel burnup, can be provided
only in versions 2 and 6 by selecting the corresponding properties of the DP in
height.

The principle of an incomplete reactor charge and introduction of the DP into the
freed cells was used on the basis of investigations when forming the initial fuel
charge of the M reactor. selecting the length of the DP and of the distribution
of its absorbing properties in height is determined by two factors. First, the DP
rods should provide compensation of reactivity (together with rods of the control
system) in all states of the reactor. Second. the DP mods should contribute to
equalization of the energy release field through the reactor height to the required
limits. The OP composition was corrected directly during physical startup of the
Rank reactor: the heavy and light absorbing rings were assembled in a ratio of
1/2 in the upper and lower sections 1 meter long each and in the ratio 3/1 in the

central section 5 meters long.

Selecting the location of installing the DP in the core. since the DP rod is in-
terchangeable by design dinensione with the assembly, locating them in the core

is not limited by any design solutions and different methods of locating the DP
with respect to the 5th channels in the periodicity cell can be considered. Cal-
culations of the periodicity cells by the 68 program with different arrangement of
the DP and different content of suz channels showed that the multiplication factor
may differ in this case by approximately one percent without rods and by 0.5 percent
with $02 rods, while the maxim output of the fuel channels may differ by approxi-
mately 2 percent. 0f greatest interest is conparison of two sy-etrical arrange-
ments of the DP in the periodicity cell with respect to the suz channels. shown in
Pigure 2.2. The locations of the DP were compared with full initial charge of the
reactor in the working state both with and without suz rods. with the standard
arrangement of the DP, the control rods regulate the output of the freshly charged
assembly more effectively than with dwckerboard arrang-ent. This circmstance
forces one to give preference to standard arrangement of the DP since both ver-
sions differ slightly in efficiency of the DP and the 502 rods.

 

Figure 2.2. hrrangement of DP in Periodicity Cells: a--standard: b--checker-

Energy release distribution through core height and radius. The distribution of
the absorbing properties through the length of the DP have a significant effect on
the shape of the axial energy release distribution during the initial moment of
reactor operation: the suz rods may have the same effect. The actual arrangement
of the control rods in the core in the absence of programs for three-dimensional
calculation of the reactor can be taken into account only approximately. This type
of analysis shows that the shape of the field may very very slightly in height
when the rods are shifted and the USP rods must be located below the center of the
core to compensate for the field distortions of incompletely inserted RR rods.

The nonunifcrnity coefficient in height can be maintained in the range of 1.25-1.50
with selected composition of the DP.

Calculated investigations of the energy release distribution through the reactor
radius can be arbitrarily divided into three phases. The ratio of the number of
DP in the central and peripheral homogenized regions of the reactor required for
given equalization of energy release through the core radius is determined in the
first phase. The specific cartogram of DP arrangement in the core is refined dur-
ing the second phase by means of two-dimensional programs for calculating the re-
actor as a whole. The physical startup period of the reactor when a large nunber
of calculations is made by two-dimensional program, from the results of which the
initial charge of the reactor is selected with regard to the data actually
achieved in the reactor. should be taken into account by the third phase of

investigating the radial energy release fields. (The initial charge contains
l,4SO-l,440 assemblies and 230-240 DP for operating Rm reactors as a function of
the production tolerances on the charge and enridunant of the fuel and graphite
density). It was shown by calculations that a position of 802 rods can be selected
in the hot poisoned state of the reactor in which the reactivity conmsated for by
then is approximately equal to the design operational reserve of reactivity, while
nonuniform energy release distribution through the radius comprises 1.28.

Calculated investigations of a full charge and later the experience of operating
the sour reactor showed that its characteristic feature is the high sensitivity of
neutron fields to displacement of the control ushers. This is related to the fact
that the high excess reactivity is compensated for by a large nmber of absorbers
and when some of then are removed (especially the peripheral absorbers) a region
occurs, semis-es close to criticality and containing 15-20 channels with TVS along
which there is not a single absorber. In this regard the point of locating the
rods and the RR rods to be remved should be selected very carefully, observing a
specific sequence of removing the RR rods.

Based on numerous calculations to equalize the energy release fields in the reac-
tor, it has been suggested that all 89 RR rods be divided into four groups as a
function of their location in the reactor (table 2.4) . the fourth group coabines
the peripheral rods and the central rods are divided into three regular lattices
embedded into each other. Operational compensation of the excess reactivity is ac-
complished at each meant of time by the RR rods of one of the central groups and
by the peripheral rods which are shifted so as to equalize the currents of the side
ionization chambers. The rods of each central group are shifted sequentially, oc-
cupying an approximately identical position in height with deviation of 1 0.5 ester
from the mean position. the rods of the two other central groups occupy the ex-
treme upper or lower positions depending on the reactivity reserve. The indicated
procedure for removing the RR rods permits a radial nonmiformity coefficient of
approximately 1.8 to be maintained.

when reactor power is reached at which the readings of the sensors of the physical
monitoring systu become reliable, the field is actually equalised from their read-

ings by using rods of different groups.

Effects and coefficients of reactivity for initial reactor charge. DeterIination
of the temperature and density effects of core reactivity of the am reactor is
one of the most cowlex calculations. This is largely determined by the complex-
ity of the core compositim and also by the essentially total absence of experimen-
tal data by the time of reactor startup which would nice it possible to correct the
methods of calculating the effects of reactivity. Experimental data were obtained
on an insert of Bl channels and on critical assemblies having half the core height
where rods 2 or 3 meters long were used rather than on a full-scale bench. In this
regard the calculations of reactivity effects were corrected and were partially
done again with regard to the experimental results obtained in the reactor.

Three main problems were considered for the initial charge: variation of reactiv-
ity upon dehydration of the core in the cold state. variation of reactivity upon
heating of the core and determination of the reactivity coefficients in the working
state. The calculated and experimental data on variation of reactivity with dehy-
dration of the core of a cold unpoieoned reactor are presented in Table 2.5.

Study of the variation of reactivity with heating 0: the core made it possible to
analyze such iuportant reactor characteristics as the temperature coefficients of
moderator reactivity ac, water a“, fuel at and total teaperature coefficient a;
The calculation was made for the temperature range of loo-200°C on the assumption
that 90 control rods were inserted into the core (Table 2.6). The reactivity co-
efficients were calculated for nominal working values of heat engineering param-
eters of the reactor on the assumption that 30 fully charged rods were located in
its core in this state. The calculated values of the reactivity coefficients were
as follows: “c - o. a“ - -s.1-10'5°c'1, “t - -1.o~10'5°c'1; the density coeffi-
cient of reactivity was ay - 1.44-10-2 m3/g and the steam coefficient of reactiv-
ity was a. - Ao/Ac - -1-10'2.

Variation of the reactivity coefficients during reactor operation is considered
below.

Neutron flux density distribution through the assembly and fuel elements. The
thermal flux density distribution through the cell was calculated by the 51-5 pro-
gran in P3-approximation with regard to themaliration for a homogenized model of
the channel. For conveience in asking heat engineering calculations, the flux
density distribution through each fuel element, according to [10], is reduced to
the form

where p; is the relative flux density level in the fuel element of the i-th row,
cu is the flux density gradient through fuel elements of the i-th row. 51 is the
coefficient of corrosion of the flux density in the fuel element and 6 and r are
the polar coordinates of a point with respect to the center of the fuel element.

The neutron distribution through the microoell, consisting of a fuel element sur-
rounded by an equivalent amount of water, was calculated to determine parameter

in fly-approximation. Parameter E, which was equal. to 0.2 5'2, was determined by
the neutron distribution inside the fuel elenent. It was assumed that the value
of e is identical for all fuel elelsents. Parameters p1 - 0.611, ql - 0.0331 ce'1,
p2 - 0.706 and ‘12 - 0.0845 «'1 were determined for fuel elements of the inner

(i - l) and outer (k I 2) ring by the neutron flux density distribution through the
cell. As a result the following expressions were found for energy release in rel-
ative units:

m' (r, 0) = (0.6!! J.- 0,033: r cos 9) exp (0._2 r’); 5. -0f55:
a), (r, o) (0,706+o.0845 r cos 0) exp (0.2 r'); 0. =- 0.765: 0 = 0.73.

where 31, 32 and o are the mean values of the volunetric energy release in the
fuel elements of the inner ring, the outer ring and in all the fuel elenents,
respectively.

According to the derived expressions, the coefficient of nonuniformity of energy
release through the fuel elements was Ktv I 1.05, the coefficient of nonuniformity
of the specific energy intensity of the fuel was Kv - 1.11 and the marinas coeffi-
cient of nonunifornity through the radius of the fuel element was Kg" - 1.06. The
calculation corresponds to uniform distribution of fissionable isotopes through
the radius of the fuel element. Accumulation of Pu-239, which will occur to a
greater degree in the outer layers of the fuel element core, distorts the form of
energy release in the fuel, but the considered distribution is the most dangerous
for maximua fuel tesperature.

2.4.3. The Transient Operating Period of the Reactor

The transient operating period of the reactor, i.e., the time from the initial
charge to the stationary fuel recharging node, is characterized by continuous vari-
ation of the reactor parameters and the cosposition of the core. me of the most
significant problems during this period is that of organizing continuous recharging
of the fuel assemblies that satisfy the conditions of maintaining the reactivity
reserve and nonuniforuity of energy release within given limits. Solution of this
problem can be complicated by additional operating conditions, for example, delay
of the deadlines for introducing the loading-unloading machine, the need to re-
charge specific channels and so on. Recomendation on the sequence of recharging
the DP were presented for conditions of planned continuous recharging and the con-
sumption of assemblies, the extent of burnup of removed fuel and other indicators
of the reactor required to determine the economic characteristics of the plant
during the transition period were determined.

For convenience in calculations, fuel recharging can be related to periodicity
cells. In this case the core was divided into two radial zones: a central and
peripheral and it was assumed that the periodicity cells in each zone are

19

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

identical and have their own constant total output determined by the number of
cells in the zone and by the average output of the zone. Il‘he calculated periodic-
ity cell in the central zone has a mean output of 28.9 m and contains 12 fuel
assesblies. 2 DP and 2 502 channels at the initial meant. The calculated cell in

the peripheral zone has a mean output of 21.8 MW and contains 13 assemblies. 2 DP
and 1 $02 channel.

All the periodicity cells in each zone are recharged by an identical program with
specific sequence of assembly replacement. This sequence of channel recharging is
maintained throughout the entire operating life of the reactor. Channels arranged
identically in the periodicity cells are recharged to maintain the charge symmetry
and its periodicity in each reactor zone. It is obvious that under real condi-
tions the recharging program can be corrected on the basis of the actual power gen-
eration of the channels and the energy release distribution through the reactor.
Moreover. disruptions of the adopted sequence may occur on the periphery of the re-
actor where identical periodicity cells cannot be clearly determined.

Calculating the fuel recharging mode. The results of calculating the recharging
mode by the RINDI program are presented in Tables 2.7-2.9. According to the cal-
culation by this program, the average extent of fuel burnup in the steady recharg-
ing mode comprises 19 cwday/t, which is in agreement with the planned value of
18.5 GH-day/t within several percent.

The data presented in Tables 2.7 and 2.8 permit one to estimate the operating con-
ditions of the initial charge channels in the reactor and to find several values
that characterize the transient operating period of the reactor, for example. the
consmption of assemblies for the entire reactor during the transient operating
period (Table 2.10). The consumption of fuel assemblies comprises 475 with the
reactor generating 106 Hw-day of thermal energy in the steady recharging node.

Effects and coefficients of reactivity. Due to the complexity of the core struc-
ture and the nonuniform distribution of burnup through the core, calculation of the
effects and coefficients of reactivity during transient operation of the reactor is
a complex problem. Therefore, they were designed with average burnup of 5 and lO
Gw-day/t of the charged channels initially since reeoval of the DP through one of
each periodicity cell is completed with burnup of S GWday/t and removal of all DP
is completed with burnup of lo 01-day/t. The calculated values of the reactivity
coefficients and the indicated moments of the run are presented in Table 2.11.

The results indicated in Table 2.11 were found on the assumption that the reactor
has nominal heat engineering characteristics and that 20 control rods are inserted
into the core to compensate for the operational reserve of reactivity.

Misalignment of output during recharging of the DP. Calculations of a reactor

in the DP recharging mode presented above and of replacement of the DP by fuel as-
semblies were made on the basis of the condition of simultaneous replacement of
DP in all periodicity cells of the reactor. In this case only the power redistri-
bution inside the periodicity cell is taken into. account. In fact, periodicity
cells with different number of DP are located in the reactor, which distorts the

neutron flux distribution through the reactor.

2.4.4. The Steady Fuel Recharging Mode

The extent of fuel burnup. The characteristics of the RBMK reactor in the steady
continuous fuel recharging node are presented in Tab1e 2.12. A reactor with
height-averaged properties is considered: average coolant density of 0.516 g/cn3
and average coolant temperature of 284°C. The operational reserve of reactivity
is equal to 1 percent and leakage to the height is 1 percent, which corresponds to
a reactor model with unequalired power diatributicn by height. Correction tor
self-equalization of power by height during burnup is introduced into the average
burnup or removed fuel to the reactor. with regard to the data presented in
Table 2.12, the average fuel burnup through the reactor is equal to 18.5 Gw-day/t
and the average run of the channel ie approximately 1,100 effective days. The
fuel removed from the reactor contains on the average, kg/t:

Energy release distribution through the height and radius of the reactor. The en-
ergy release distribution through the height of the core was calculated by the _
HINDI program with regard to nonuniform water density through the length of the
channel. nonuniform fuel burnup and the actual design of the control rod displacer.
It was assused that displacera are located in both 802 channels in the periodicity
cell. The nonuniform fuel burnup coefficient through the length of the channel is
equal to approximately 1.4 and maxim: burnup of approximately 22 Gw'day/t is lo-
cated at a height of approximately 5 meters from the bottom of the core. The non-
uniform energy liberation coefficient through the height of the Rat-IR reactor is
equal to 1.3 in the steady mode. The maxim- field is located at a height of ap-
proximately 4 meters.

The energy release field through the core radius can be represented in some cases
in the font of an equalized field having a plateau zone and a peripheral zone on
which local misalignment from the 802 rods and other inhomogeneities in the core
are indeed. The equalized neutron flux density field through the reactor radius,
calculated by the one-dimensional two-group program 009 for a reactor model with
five radial zones, is shown in Figure 2.4. ms coefficient of field nonuniformity
through the radius is K, - 1.1. Local distortions characterised by an irregular-
ity factor X10)“ whose value . according to the experience of operating uranium-
graphite reactors, is equal to 1.15, must be applied! to this field. Thus. the
maximum channel output (without regard to the recharging coefficient W) ex-
ceeds the average channel output in the reactor by a factor of approximately 1.27.

The recharging coefficient K9,, characterizes an increase of output of a freshly
charged channel compared to the mean value. According to calculation err - 1.21
and the output of a freshly charged channel in the plateau zone of the m re-

actor may reach approximately 3,000 kw with regard to the coefficients indicated
above.

The output of each production channel in the reactor must be know to solve a
nutter of design and operational problems, specifically to determine the reliabil-
ity of the core and to select the distribution of coolant flow rates through the
core channels. This calculation was possible with development of the BOKR and
QUAH programs for two-dimensional calculation of the reactor. If they are used,
it is no longer necessary to divide the core into zones, while the maximum output
of the channel is determined by the actual state of the core and by the position
of the control members. Calculations of the radial power distribution by two-

dimensional programs confirmed the possibility of achieving an irregularity fac-
tor of K: B 1.27.

Reactivity effects and coefficients. The reactivity effects and coefficients in
the standard fuel recharging mode were calculated on the asaunption that there are
channels in each periodicity cell of the reactor with burnup of 0, l, 2, 4, 5, 6,

8, 10, 12, 14, l6, l8 and 20 Gw'day/t. The average fuel burnup is equal to 9
Gw-day/t. Assuming that 20 $02 rods are completely inserted in the core, the
following reactivi y coefficients were found: ac - S.2°10'5'C' , on, - 4.9 10‘5°C'15
a, - - 2.14'10'2an /g, or - -1.15'10'5‘C'1 and a. - 1.52.10'2. The effect of de-
hydrating the working channels in the cold state for a reactor with 25 rods re-
moved was also determined for the steady fuel recharging mode and comprises 1.1
percent.

Natural indicators of the fuel cycle. The natural indicators of the fuel cycle
such as consumption of enriched uranium, consulption of natural uranium, accunula-
tion of secondary nuclear fuel and so on are usually considered to cospare the en-
gineering and economic parameters of the RB“! reactor to those of other types of
reactors and to investigate fuel cycles. The natural indicators of the fuel cycle

Note. Analyses of the operational data and additional calculations showed the
possibility and feasibility of increasing the fuel enrichment. Conversion for
enrichment of 2 percent is now carried out. Conversion to enrichment of 2.4 per-
cent and higher is planned in the future.

The effective fraction of delayed neutrons A significant fraction of the output
in the RBMK reactor is generated as a result of fission of Pu-239 nuclei accumu-
lated during operation, the fraction of delayed neutrom of which is considerably
lower than that of 0-235: 80.235 - 0.0065 and 89“.;39 - 0.0021. The effective

interest. This is related to the fact that one or another reactivity reserve

systen and of the corresponding requirensnts placed on variation of reactor power,
which has a direct effect on the extent of fuel burnup. All the characteristics
of the Ram: reactor were calculated on the assuption that the operational reactiv-
ity reserve is eqml to 1 percent. In this case a reduction of reactor power to so
percent of the nominal level is possible without it falling into the iodine pit.
The operational reactivity reserve must be increased to expand the range of per-
missible variation of power, which either reduces the extend of fuel burnup or re-
quires an increase of the initial fuel enrichment to maintain the extent of burnup.
The number of control rods that coepensate for the operational reactivity reserve
also varies. These functions are presented in rigure 2.5. The operational reac-
tivity reserve also affects the permissible tins of complete shutdown of the reac-
tor or a reduction of power or on the tire of scraming of the reactor if it falls
into the iodine pit. Thus, if reactor power varies free the 100 percent level and
if the operational reserve is 1 percent, the pereissible tine for complete shut-
down of the reactor is approximately 1 hour and the forced shutdown time is approx-
imately 24 hours: these times are equal to 3 and 18 hours, respectively, for an
operational reserve of 2 percent.

ing of load up to 50 percent, but reactivity over a period of 24 hours varies by
approximately 1.2 percent (by approximately 0.8 percent toward a decrease and 0.4
percent toward an increase from the steady poisoning level during operation at

Structurally the rods are made of individual absorbing sections 967.5 In long each
with gap of 65 In between sections. The rods are cooled by a special water cir-
cuit with temperature of 60-90%. Il‘he RR, AZ and USP rods have displacers with
outer diameter of 74 an and length of 4,960 an to reduce the harmful absorption of

32

neutrons in the cooling water. Thus, if these rods are completely removed from
the core, a displacer is located in the channel sy-setrically with respect to the
center of the core while sections of the channel approximately 1 teeter long from
the top and bottom of the displaoer are filled with water. The All rods have no
displace: and the channel is completely filled with water when they are removed.

The travel of the RR and A2 rode is 6,250 n and that of the AR rods is 4,500 an.
Being located in the extreme upper position, these rods are completely renoved
from the core and are separated by 200 an frcu its upper boundary. The USP rods
have travel of 7,000 an and are cospletely removed through the bottom of the core
and in this position the Q90! and of the USP rod is located at the level of the
lower boundary of the core.

The efficiency of the individual structural cowonents of the 502 channels in the
reactor plateau zone are essentially independent of the reactor operating period-—
initial or steady. The efficiencies presented in Table 2.18 were calculated with
respect to a solid graphite block for an absorber equal in length to the height of
the core.

The neutron flux distribution through the height for a steady recharging node is
taken into account to determine the efficiency of rods with regard to their real
dimensions and arrangement through the height of the core. The curve of the rela-
tive effectiveness of the absorbent corresponding to this flux is shown in Figure
2.9 as a function of the depth of insertion. The reactivity introduced with com-
plete displacement of the RR, AR and USP rods located in the reactor plateau zone
is presented in Table 2.19. The distribution of reactivity through the rods of
different types is presented in Table 2.20.

The values of the total efficient of the rods in the reactor presented above were
calculated for a two-zone reactor model through the radius (the periphery plateau).
Therefore, the efficiency of the rods was also calculated by two-dimensional pro-
grams. The calculations show that if the peripheral rods whose efficiency is de-
ternined to a significant degree by the specific structure of the surrounding tone

33

are excluded from consideration, then the efficiency of the rods is proportional
to the square of the neutron field in the region of insertion of the rod with ac-
curacy up to 10 percent. Therefore, the efficiencies of the rods in the plateau
zone may differ in the range of i 30 percent according to deviations of the field
from a uniform plateau in the zone in the range of 1 15 percent. Nevertheless,
the experience of operating the RBMK reactor shows that in some cases, for exam-
ple, when determining the effects of variation of reactivity at which shifting of
a large nunber of rods occurs; the concept of average rod efficiency, which is
equal to approximately 5010' , can be introduced, which is less than the reactiv-
ity of the RR rod in the plateau zone since the peripheral rods are also taken in-
to account.

The deformation of the neutron field through the reactor radius with shifting of
the control rods was investigated from the results of the two-dimensional calcula-
tions made. Deformation of the neutron flux near the rod with total and partial
insertion of it is shown in Figure 2.10. The degree of deformation was determined
as the ratio of the mean flux density on a given radius after insertion of the rod
to the flux density prior to insertion of the rod. Averaging was carried out for
all cells located at the same distance from the rod. This ratio is less than 1 for
all rods at a distance up to 12 spacings of the channel lattice from the rod and
the ratio then becomes greater than 1 due to redistribution of the neutron field
through the entire reactor.

Efficiency of rods with film cooling. The design of control rods with displacers

in the RM reactor is not optimum in neutron balance. Actually, a considerable
amount of water that absorbs neutrons remains in it after the rod is removed from
the core. When all the rods are renowd from the core, the harmful absorption in

reducing the amount of water in the core, this cooling system has a number of
other advantages. For exunple, the conditions of equalizing the energy release
field through the reactor height are improved (the coefficient of field nonuni-
fornity in height comprises approximately 1.2 in the steady node) and the extent of
fuel burnup increases by approximately 700 moday/t. It essentially becomes pos-
sible to control the neutron field by varying the height of the water cola-I in the
$02 channel. Sons characteristics of the RR and az rods with film cooling are pre-
sented in Table 2.21. The design and dimensions of the AR and USP rods do not
change and the length of the an and 32 rods is 6,130 sun. The channels of the RR
and AZ rods operate in the file cooling node. The efficiency of the rod increases
by 9 percent in the hot state.

2. 5. Nuclear Safety

The core of the RBMK reactor and the fuel assemblies and also the reactor control
and safety system and its actuating posters are made with regard to the main re-
quirements of nuclear safety regulations of the reactor which is provided in all
operating modes and states of the reactor and also during any possible emergency
situations in the production circuit.

The efficiency of 21 A2 rods with ainim rod efficiency of 4.340" in the cold
state of the reactor comprises 0.9 percent, which exceeds the value of B in re-
activity with a reserve sufficient with regard to possible “hanging" of part of the
rods. The efficiency and number of A2 rods was selected on the basis of the maxi-
mum possible rapid variation of reactivity. Variation of reactivity upon 'col-
lapse" of steam in the core and cooling of the fuel elements to teaperature at in-
put into the reactor (265°C) and won dehydration of the fuel channels in a cold
reactor was considered. It was shown by calculations that the values and even the
signs of these effects are considerably dependent on the composition of the core:
on fuel burnup. the mater of DP. $02 rods, displacers and the water columns.
Therefore, states more typical for different phases of reactor operation were se-
lected to determine the effects of reactivity and the number of A2 rods. Of course,
the conditional calculated representation of the core structure was taken into ac.
count in this case. The values of the considered fast-proceeding variations of
reactivity used to determine the nuber of AZ rods are presented in Table 2.22.

According to the calculated efficiency of $02 rods in different states and accord-
ing to the data of Table 2.21, the minor of rods should be no less than 17. Tax.
ing into account that the error of calculating the efficiency of a rod may be es-
timated at 1 20 percent, the number of A2 rods was asst equal to 21. The
minimum efficiency of one group of AR. consisting of four rods, comprises 7.2-10"
and the efficiency of one AR group in the hot state comprises 14.4.10'4. with a
rate of displacmnt of the rods of 0.4 e, the minimum rate of input of reactiv-
ity by the AR rods comprises 0.75-10'5 s’ - 0.012 8/9 (on the linear section of
the graduated curve).

A decrease of the compensating capability of both the $02 and DP rods due to the
difference of their actual design and arrangement through the core from the ideal-
ized calculated models used was taken into account in the calculations. The re-
sults of calculations for different states of the reactor and different moments
with respect to the run are presented in Table 2.23, from which it is obvious that
the 302 system provides the required subcriticality of the reactor for all states.
It should be noted that a core structure in which the inserted DP channels were
partially replaced by fresh ms was arbitrarily assisted for burnup of lo GH-day/t.
Specifically, the core was assuaed to consist of 3S periodicity cells with 2 DP and
two displacers, 20 cells with one DP, one displacer and one 502 rod and 65 cells
with one DP and two displacers for bur-mp of S GPday/t: it consisted of 20 cells
without DP and with two displacers. 20 cells without DP and with one displacer and
one 502 rod and so cells with one DP and two displacers for burmp of 10 Gw-day/ .
The actual state of the reactor will naturally differ from that seemed. There-
fore, "instructions to ensm nuclear safety during recharging operations in the
RBMK reactor' were worked out to observe the conditions of nuclear safety during
operation of the reactor in the group DP recharging rode.

2.6. Physical and Power Startup of mactor

aperiments during physical startup of the first unit of the m reactor. Start-
up of the M reactor is an inportant phase of checking the correctness of the
calculated methods and of the applicability of the physical models and finding the
final, most dependable neutron-physical characteristics of the reactor. Special
attention should be devoted to obtaining information required for subseqmnt op-
eration of the reactor.

The main problems of experiments conducted during physical startup of the reactor
and assembly of full charge of the core reduce to the following. Several ever-
increasing critical systems for estimating the characteristics of the fuel assem-
blies. DP, 5112 rods and graphite stacking are assembled for comparison with exper-
imental data found on a bench or on previous reactors. The ninimsn critical
system, including the assemblies located in the center of the core. are first
assenbled according to the charging cartogram the critical systems with DP and
with DP and $02 rods are then assembled. The reactivity effects when the 802 chan-
nels, channels with assemblies and with DP are filled with water are analyzed as
full charge is approached. The neutron fields are measured in a full charge. The
initial charge of the reactor is shaped with regard to the specific production
characteristics of its components during the final phase by readjustment or removal
of several DP. The results of calculations are corrected parallel to obtaining the

experimental data. The detailed order of experiments with calculated substantia-
tion for each motor is determined by the working program of physical startup.

A systee without DP with standard suz rods resoved with dehydrated HPTs circuits
and cooling of $02 reached criticality after charging of 23 fuel assenblies with
two partially charged rods of the tesporary $02).

A system with additional absorbers was then investigated. which made it possible

to determine the critical sass with reuoved suz rods and to estimate the efficiency
of the initially selected composition. A DP composition with ratio of 3:1 of heavy
and light sleeves in the central part 5,000 I. long and ratio of 1:2 in the end
sections 1,000 I. long each was taken and charging was continued up to 77 periodic-
ity cells front the results of analyzing the experiment and calculation.

Reactivity effects related to filling the 502 channels and channels with fuel as-
semblies and DP with water were investigated in a system consisting of 77 periodic-
ity cells. The experiments were conducted in three phases:

1) study of the reactivity effects with $02 drannels filled with water with
"dry" HPTs circuit:

2) investigating the variation of reactivity with the arm circuit filled
with water with filled suz circuit:

3) determining the effect of dehydration of the $02 circuit with Ms cir-
cuit filled.

Each phase of the investigations was coupleted by bringing the reactor to the
critical state.

The $02 channel cooling circuit was filled separately for each group of rods.
Positive reactivity was observed with the channels having charged rods filled with
water, while the water in the channels with remved rods reduced the reactivity
as a result of neutron absorption. The total effect of filling the 802 circuit
with water was negative and was ccepensated for by remving 16 standard suz rods
and by inserting two RR rods of the teworary suz. l’illing the Ms circuit with
water led to determination of positive reactivity of 1.75 B. Dehydration of the
802 circuit with water in the Me circuit was compensated for by introduction of
19 standard 502 rods.

It was established as a result of the experiments that a system with Ms circuit
filled with water and dehydrated suz circuit has the highest reactivity. however.
further charging was continued in the coupletely dehydrated core with regard to
the need of conducting production work in the Me circuit.

The effect of variation of reactivity with dehydration of channels containing fuel
assemblies, which was negative and equal to 0.15 B, was determined in this system

01' 77 periodicity cells. RON-W31 of water from DP channels decreased the reac-
tivity of the system by 1.8 8 .

One of the important integral parts of physical startup was measuring the energy
release fields through the reactor. The purpose of these measurements was as
follows:

selecting the final arrangement of the fuel assewlies and DP;

analysis of the capabilities of equalizing the energy release field with $02
rods:

substantiation of using the physical calculation programs to predict the en-
ergy release fields:

determination of the effects of the field nicrestructure and other character-
istics required to process the discrete measurements of the energy release fields
during operation of the reactor.

The neasurements were made by small fission chambers whose design was specially
calculated for installation in the carrier times of the fuel asserblies with energy
release monitors. The maeurements were made at eight points through a height of
249 asseublies. The calculated distribution gives a good reflection of the micro-
structure of the energy release field, but yields exaggerated values of energy re-
lease on the reactor periphery. Analysis of the divergence of the experimental
distribution of the energy release field with the calculated value found by the
Bonk-€082 program showed that the structure of the zone, specifically the extent
of insertion of the rods, the presence of channels under the starting ionisation
chambers in the reflector and the axial distribution of the neutron field, must be
taken into account in detail for more accurate calculation of the energy release
field. Comparison of the experinental and calculated data found during physical
startup of the reactor of the second unit showed that the mean square deviation of
the calculated data found by the son-c032 program (with regard to the height dis-
tribution of neutrons) comprises 9.7 percent from the experimental values. This
deviation was also found for calculations made by the gum-2 program.

Investigation of the physical characteristics during power startup. Measuring the
reactivity effects and coefficients.

Determination of reactivity effects begins with determination of the integral ef-
fect of variation of reactivity upon heating of the reactor. Calibrated curves
for “weighing" individual rods, obtained in the reactor during heating, are used
to estimate the variation of reactivity compensated for by moving the suz rods.

The total temperature coefficient a; that takes into account the simultaneous var-
iation of temperature and water density, fuel and graphite temperature measured
during first heating of the reactor in the temperature range of loo-220°C was neg-
ative and equal to -(4 3 0.5)-1o-5'c‘1. The total temperature coefficient deter-
mined upon heating of the reactor after operation for 25 effective days comprised
-(s 1 0.5)-1o-5°c‘1 in the temperature range of 120-260°c. Comparison of the
states of the reactor with the constants of water temperature and power, but dif-
fering graphite temperature, permits one to determine the temperature coefficient

Precise determination of the reactivity coefficients, which however it is dupli-
cated to determine by calculation, is required to ensure reliable and safe opera-
tion of the reactor: therefore, a program of experiments to detenine the steel

and power coefficients is realiu i in the reactor. An estinate of the steam co-

efficient of reactivity. according to a mode with deviation of one power pup by
45 percent of noninal power, carried out with average fuel burnup of 500 m-day/t

Gw-day/t. The experiment was conducted with reduction of power and low opera-
tional reserve of reactivity (6-8 rode). Processing of the experimental data
showed that the steam void coefficient of reactivity bees-e positive: 6.1m.73.

The total power coefficient of reactivity (with ties constant of the effect less
than 100 seconds), measured at power of 2,060 m (t) with burnup of l GH-day/t,
was found to be negative: on - Ao/Au - -2.s-1o-6 not-1 (thermal): nu - -3.2-io‘6
W1 with burnup of 2 GWoday/t and with power reduction from 1,540 to 1,240 m (t).

“as temperature coefficient of graphite “C I 4.10‘5‘6'1 was determined by replacing
the heliue purging of the graphite stacking with nitrogen purging with constant re-
actor power and burnup of 3.5 Gw-day/t. Processing the graphite tesperature by the
readings of standard thermocouples with averaging through the reactor vole-s (with-
out regard to the nonuniformity of the graphite block through the values) shoved
that the increase of the mean graphite tenperature through the reactor per 101 of
thermal power is equal to 0.05'c/m for helium cooling of the stacking and was
equal to 0.1'CIMW for nitrogen cooling. Accordingly, the power coefficient of re-
activity thrgugh the graphite was equal to 0.2.10-5 url for helium cooling and to
0.4.10‘ HR“ for nitrogen cooling. The error of determining the data can be es-
timated at 1- 30 percent.

Experimental investigation of energy release fields. The distribution of the re-
sidual y-activity of the M was measured repeatedly in the shutdown reactor dur-
ing Operation of the R3!!! reactor. The Purpose of these experiments was to cali-
brate the radial distribution sensors, to determine the error of discrete
monitoring of the energy release fields and to estimate the error of calculating
the energy release fields. According to the experimental results, the mean square
errors of determining the output of the W8 comprise 9 percent forphysical calcu-
lation by the son-con program and 3 percent for y-scanning.

Satisfactory agreement of the calculated and measured power distribution of the
fuel assemblies made it possible to confidently use the calculated data for oper-
ational control of the energyrelease field in the core by using the Price pro.
gran in the plant computer. Besides the Prim program, the energy release fields
were monitored and controlled through the reactor by using calculations by a con-
plex of saris programs on an external Emu-6 cosputer. The complex of Basis pro-
grams combines the progru for physical calculation of the fields (son-m2). the
program of statistical interpolation of channel output from the readings of the
energy release monitoring sensors (Atlas) and the progran for thermohydraulic cal-
culation of the channels and calculation of the heat engineering reliability
(Zapas). The position of the control mere, fuel burnup in the channels, cur-
rents of the intrareactor sensors and distribution of the coolant flow rates
through the reactor channels are used as the input data. The power distribution

through all the operating channels of the reactor. the error of determining the
output of each channel and the reserve to heat transfer crisis in each channel are
determined as a result of calculation. The complex of Basis programs is a means
of monitoring the operation of the Prisna program.

Recharging the max reactor during operation. A loss of reactivity due to fuel
burnup is restored when the reactor is recharged. Recharging the channels during
operation by means of an unloading-loading machine (m) is provided in PM re-
actors. If putting the RZH into operation is delayed. the channels can be re-
charged in groups (the DP is unloaded during the initial phase) in a shutdown
reactor. The nunber and location of the removed DP is determined by the specific
operating conditions of the reactor prior to shutdown (the reactivity reserve, the
form of radial energy release and so on) and after shutdown (naxinum power and
proposed operating tine). Calculated prediction of the next recharging is made by
BOKR-COBZ and gum-2 programs. but a depoisoned reactor with dehydrated suz cool-
ing circuit (a state with maximum reactivity) is periodically brought to the crit-
ical state after each recharging to check that nuclear safety conditions are ful-
filled. The main characteristics of recharging carried out on the RBHK reactor of
the first unit of the Leningrad ABS are presented in Table 2.24 and the change of
the core structure is show.

All the DP were distributed on several lattices eabedded one into the other. which
were recharged in sequence, for convenience in selecting the DP during routine re-
charging. The peripheral DP are exceptions to this rule, which is related to the
characteristic features of the 502 rod lattice on the reactor periphery. The DP of
the peripheral group are recharged as necessary with regard to equalization of the
radial energy release field.

Physical startup of the second unit of the near reactor. Physical startup of the
second unit of the RBHK reactor was begun in May-June 1975. The most important
problem of the experiments carried out during physical startup was comparison of
the characteristics of the reactors of the first and second mite. Systems inves-
tigated in the reactor of the first unit were brought to the critical state several
times for this purpose during assembly of a full charge and a full charge complete-
ly similar to the initial charge of the reactor of the first unit was also assen-
bled. It was established by experiments that all the investigated critical systels
have lower reactivity than the corresponding systems of the reactor of the first
unit. This difference comprised 0.5 percent for a full charge with water in the
Me circuits and $02 cooling.

Analysis of the calculated and experimental data showed that this divergence can be
explained to a significant degree by the difference in the average graphite density
in the reactors of both units (1.73 and 1.67 g/an3. respectively). The effect of
dehydration of the fuel channels (0.65 3 for the second unit compared to 0.5 e for
the first unit) became somewhat more negative.

The number of DP was reduced to supplement the deficient reactivity in the reactor:
the initial charge contains 1,455 TVS and 230 DP and eight channels (on the reactor

periphery) remained uncharged. The initial reactor charge is presented in Figure
2.3. Physical startup of the reactor is an important phase of putting an ass into
operation. The startups of the m reactors showed that the difference of

characteristics of the core components and to ensure conditions of subsequent re-

steam is sent to turbines at a flow rate of 5,400 t/hr at temperature of 284°C and

Assembled steel sections of the reactor. The forces due to the weight of the in-
ternal assemblies, assemblies and piping of the reactor is transuitted to the con-
crete and the inner cavity of the reactor is also sealed by means of welded as-
sembled steel sections (see Figure 3.1) that at the sane tine perform the role of
biological shielding. The upper cover 10 serves as the floor of the central root:

of the upper piping of the reactor. The design of the lower part 11 of the cover-
ing 10 is made in the form of metal ducts filled with iron shot and serpentinite.

The graphite stacking is surrounded by water biological shielding located in the
side assembled steel section. The latter is made in the form of a cylindrical tank
of circular cross section with outer diameter of 19 meters and inner diameter of
16.6 meters. The reservoir is separated inside into 16 vertical airtight compart-
ments filled with water that also remove heat from the graphite stacking. The
cooling water is fed to the compartments from below and is removed from the top.
The channels of the starting and operating ionization chambers, drain pipes and
thermocouples sleeves for measuring the water temperature in the compartments are
located in the side structures. The installation space between the outer surface
of the side structure and the surrounding walls of the concrete shaft is filled
with sand.

The upper and lower assembled steel sections belong to the more complex and crucial
assemblies. The upper section 8 (see Figure 3.1) is a cylindrical shell 17 meters
in diameter and 3 meters high. The bottoms of the shell (the upper and lower slabs)
are welded to it along the periphery by airtight seams and are welded to each
other by vertical stiffening ribs. Openings are bored in the slabs after rein-
forcing assembly and welding of the structure during installation according to the
location of the precisely repeated openings in the graphite stacking for the fuel
channels. channel pipes for the fuel channels and the channels for the control
and monitoring system are installed in the openings and welded and the space inside
the formed reservoir between the pipes is filled with serpentinite. The airtight—
ness of the structure and the quality of welding should meet the reqiresents of
helium density. The upper assembled steel section is installed on 16 roller sup-
ports mounted on an annular projection in the upper part of the side steel section
and receives the force from the weight of the charged fuel channels, the slab floor
and the pipelines of the upper piping of the reactor.

The lower assembled steel section 3--the footing for the graphite stacking-~has the
shape of a tubular drum 14.5 meters in diameter and 2 meters high. The structure

is loaded by the graphite stacking installuxl on it and by the pipelines of the lower
piping of the reactor. Its inner cavity is filled with serpentinite and nitrogen.
The number and arrangement of the lower channel pipes for the fuel channels, welded
into the upper and lower bottoms of the assembled steel section, are the same as in
the upper steel section. After the channel pipes have been welded into the assets-
bled steel section. its inner cavity is tested with a mixture of air and helium to
pressure of 1.25 kgf/cm2 (approximately 0.125 MPa).

The main assembled steel support section 1 (see Figure 3.1) in the reactor is
loaded more since it transmits the weight of the lower assembled steel section, the
graphite stacking and the weight of the lower water pipelines to the laying part of
the foundation plate of the building. At the same time its design solution is dis-
tinguished by simplicity and originality. The design is two plates with stiffening
ribs 5.3 meters high perpendicular to each other that intersect through the center
of the reactor. The plates are welded along the axes of symtry (in the reactor
plane) to the bottom assembled steel section.

Anticorrosion coatings are applied during installation to all the assembled steel
sections of the reactor operating in a gaseous medium with the presence of water

vapor .

The assembled steel section of the upper covering 10 in the central room has a
passage for installation of the fuel and special channels. i‘he diabeter of the
passage exceeds that of the graphite stacking. The passage is covered by replac-
able flooring consisting of individual slabs. The flooring plays the role of
biological shielding of the central room against radiation of the upper piping of
the reactor and the fuel assembly men it is removed from the fuel channel and al-
so serves as heat insulation of the central row.

The slab flooring consists of upper and lower slabs and blocks resting on three
risers. The slabs and blocks of the flooring are assembled steel sections filled
with concrete-bariu-serpentinite meat stone (ZhBS'l‘sK).

The space between the upper and loser slabs and blocks of the flooring is used to
lead in the cables of the 502 servodrives, the energy release monitoring sensors
and thermocouples. Air that then passes through the ventilation duct is puaped
into the m of the upper piping of the reactor from the central room through
gaps of the plate flooring. me ptsaped air cools the plate flooring and eliain-
ates the possibility that radioactive discharges will enter the central room from
the upper piping of the reactor.

Hater is delivered and distributed through the reactor channels from group collec-
tors of the lower water piping through pressure-regulating valves and flow neters.
1b service, monitor and repair these assenblies, they are mounted in the passages
below the floor of the roon for controlling the regulating valves in the room of
the distributing group collectors. me passages are covered with slabs of con-
crete biological shielding through which rods from the regulating valves are
passed into the upper room.

The graphite stacking. The graphite stacking (figure 3.2) is assenbled on the
lower structure inside the reactor space. It is a vertical cylinder assembled
from columns (2,488) consisting of graphite block's. Bach black is a parallele-
piped in shape with cross-section of 250 x 250 an and 200, 300, 500 and 600 In
high. The main blocks are 600 as high while the shortened blocks are installed
only in the upper and lower end reflectors to displace the joints of the blocks
of adjacent colunns through the height of the reactor. The overall dimensions of
the core (the graphite moderator) are presented below, the thickness of the end
reflectors is 500 m and the thickness of the side reflector is an average of
1,000 m. The mass of the stacking is 1,700 tons. Graphite that meets special
requirements in nuclear purity and density is used to manufacture the blocks.
There are openings 114 III in diameter along the axis of the block that form chan-
nels in the columns for the fuel channels and the control and nonitoring channels.
Graphite rods 6 are installed in the openings (channels) of the columns of the
side reflector instead of the channels.

Bach graphite colunn is installed on a steel support slab 5 which in turn rests on
a support 4 welded to the upper slab of the lover assembled steel section. The
columns are attached and centered in the upper part through sleeve pipes 9 welded
into the upper assembled steel section by means of shielding slabs 7 and connecting
pipes 8. The shielding and support slabs are essentially identical in design.
Manufactured of steel, besides performing the functions of intermediate cosponents
for attaching the coll-Ins, they provide thermal shielding of the slabs of the

Figure 3.2. Graphite Shielding

A diaphragm 2 designed first to create some resistance to the flow of the helium-
nitrogen mixture fed through the lower assosnbled stool section to direct it through
the openings in the support housings into the gap botvoen valves and the stacking
blocks and second to reduce the heat transfer by radiation from the support slabs
to the upper slab of the lower assembled steel section, is attached to tho supports
by washers l and 3. The diaphragm is made in tho form of individual sheets of
0810118N10‘r stool 5 an thick. The gap between the diaphragm and tho inner surface
of the housing of the stacking ll is closed with a ring 12.

The graphite stacking is secured against displacements in the radial direction by
rods 10 located in the peripheral columns of tho side reflector. The rod is wel-
ded below to the support and is movably connected above to the sleeve pipe welded
into the lower slab of the upper assembled steel section. The upper joint provides

50

freedom to temperature shifts of the rod. At the ease tire the rod is a reflec-
tor cooling channel. It is manufactured from pipe with outer diameter of 110 am
and wall thickness of 5 use. The Iaterial is 0810118th steel.

All the enmerated asseialies are under intensive neutron irradiation and elevated
temperatures during reactor operation: thus, for example. the temperature of the
support structures reaches 350°C in the region of the upper lattice of the lower
assembled steel section and «O'C on the lower support slabs and the will. graph-
ite temperature (calculated) is 750'c.

The temperature conditions of the graphite stacking. The heat from the stacking
is remved to the fuel channels (partially to the suz channels), due to which its
temperature mode is determined by heat transfer from the graphite blocks to the
fuel channels. Gas with an average mass cosposition of 40 percent heliu plus 60
percent nitrogen was used to ensure heat transfer and to maintain the temperature
of the stacking in the range of 700-750'c. sleeves 8 (see Figure 3.3)--solid con-
tact split graphite rings 20 mm high, which were arranged along the height of the
channel tightly against each other such that each alternating ring has direct con-
tact along the lateral surface with either a pipe or with the inner surface of a
block and also with each other along the ends, are placed for this purpose on the
fuel channels. The minimum channel-sleeve and sleeve-block clearances were deter-
mined from the condition of the ispermissibility of the channel becoming clogged
in the stacking due to its radiation-thermal shrinkage during operation of the re-
actor. A total maximum reduction of the tolerances on the order of 1.5-2 II was
adopted on the basis of operation of uraniun-grephite reactors and also data on
irradiation of the reactor graphite, which ensures operation of the reactor for a
long time.

The graphite tesperature initially increases during operation of the reactor due to
an increase of the end clearances between the graphite blocks and then decreases
due to the prevailing reduction of the radial clearances. A stable tesperature of
the stacking is establist for approximately 5 years and in this case the taper-
ature in the corners of the blocks will be 660°C. The highest temperature of 740'c
(760°C in the corners of the block) is reached during the initial period of oper-
ation. The temperature of the outer surface of the fuel channel pipe under the
solid contact rings does not exceed 325°C. This course of argusents is supported
by data obtained during operation of RB!!! reactors at the Leningrad. Rural; and
Chernobyl'skaya ABS.

3.2. The Fuel Channel

One of the main assemmies that determines the economy and reliability of reactor
operation is the fuel channel. It is designed for location of TVS with nuclear
fuel and to create a coolant flow. The main heat engineering parameters of the
fuel channel at 100 percent reactor power are greeented in Section 3.1. The inte-
gral neutron flux (En > 0.7 MeV) reaches 3.101 neutrons/cal2 during the calculated
service life of the channel.

The reactor fuel channel is shown in Figure 3.3. The channel housing is a welded
structure whose middle part consists of a pipe 9 with outer diameter of 88 III and
wall thickness of 4- ms manufactured from 2r + 2.5 percent Nb alloy. while the

51

upper 3 and lower ll end parts welded to it are made of corrosion-resistant pipes
(oaxhlSNlOT steel) of various diameters. Selection of a zirconium-niobium alloy
for the middle part of the channel in the reactor core was determined by the fact
that this alloy has satisfactory mechanical and corrosion properties (0‘, 1 25
hot/m2 (approximately 250 HPa), 00.2 3 17 kgf/mz (approximately no MPa) and 6

is 17 percent) with relatively small thermal neutron absorption cross-section (s‘ -
- (o.2-o.3)-1029 oz). The middle part of the channel housing is joined to the and
parts by specially developed steel-zirconium adapters. '

2 and lower in assembled steel section. It is movably attached in the upper part
by a emport fillet and by argon-arc welding of. 'tendril“ seam 4. The lower part
of the housing is connected by welding to the slave pipe of the assesbled steel sec-
tion through the_bellows coupensator assenbly 12. which permits compensation of
the difference in the temperature expansion of the fuel channel and the assembled
steel sections of the reactor and also makes it possible to create reliable air-
tightness of the gas cavity. Moreover. a stuffing-box seal 13 is installed below
the bellows coapensator in case the bellows fails. The service life of the channel
housing is calculated at 25-30 years and if necessary it is replaced in shutdohm
equipment by means of a special unit which remotely cuts the 'tendril" seam between
the sleeve and channel inside the upper sleeve and after the channel has been re-
placed also remotely welds this seam and checks the quality by x—ray flaw detec-
tion. The lower sean between the bellows compensator and the channel is cut and
welded by a special automatic welding machine.

The fuel assembly is installed inside the channel on a suspension 5 which holds it
in the reactor core and provides replacemnt of the spent assesbly by means of an
RZH without shutting down the reactor.

A plug cap 7 installed in a housing 6 and which seals the channel with a gasket is
located on the upper end of the suspension. A solid steel plug 1, which is the
biological shielding is installed between the assembly and the locking plug.

The steel-zirconiun joint. Development of a strong and vacuuu tight welded steel-
zirconiml joint for the fuel channels of the max reactor was begun in 1965. Sev-
eral steel-zirconium joints developed and med both in the USSR and abroad were
known by this time. Methods of connecting steel and zirconiun parts by contact-
reactive soldering, explosive welding, joint molding and so on were known. how-
ever, all these methods could not be used for connecting the pipes of the fuel
channel of the W reactor. The joints produced by these methods were designed
to operate at lower parauters, had lower requirements on retention of airtightness
and were made with steels having lower level of permissible stresses at operating
tesperatures. Therefore, a joint design, the basis of which was the diffusion
welding method, was adopted for the ”MK reactor (Figure 3.4).

The inner part of the reducer coupling is made of a zirconium alloy and the outer
part, the enclosing part, is made of stainless austenitic steel. The design of the
adaptor coupling was develOped with regard to achieving a configuration and progres-
med stress state in the joint that guarantee strength and reliability under oper-
ating conditions. The welding technique ensures an optimus diffusion,interlayer in

steel-zirconium joint was checked with investigation of the stress state at oper-
ating temperatures. cyclic strength, corrosion resistance. prolonged corrosive
strength and resistance. Bench end reactor tests of the join con red their
high efficiency during prolonged operation, brief overheating and cyclic thernel

loads .

The adapter coupling is welded to a sireoniun alloy pipe by electric-arc welding
in a vacuum. The developed design and technique of the welded joint provide
strength with high degree of flexibility. Thermal-strain hardening conditions and
machining of the weld seams and near-seen zones were developed to fulfill high re-
quirenents in corrosion resistance. The steel part of the adapter coupling is
joined to the steel pipe of the channel by argon-arc welding.

The locking device of the fuel channel. The duct of the m fuel channel is
sealed on top by a locking device--plug. with regard to the fact that sealing, un-
sealing and replacement of the fuel asselbly operations should be carried out by an
122“ with remote control, the plug has a simple design that provides reliable con-
ducting of machine operations related to its rueovalo-rotation and vertical motion.
The requirements to ensure airtightness for the entire service life of the fuel
assembly (3-3.5 years) with 30 heat changes during the service life were advanced
during development of the locking device; the sealing gasket should he installed
and removed by the same RZM operations; the inner duct should have no sharp turns

and projections to avoid damage to the surface of the fuel element.

me main working members in the plug (Figure 3.5) are a screw and a holder made of
harder steel. During installation of the channel, the are works with a special
claw on screw 4, which ensures attaclmunt of the plug to the channel housing and
consequently ensures sealing. when the TVS is installed into the channel, the sus-
pension housing assembled into a single assembly with the plug, is lowered into the
duct housing. The screw is then tightened upward to the maximum, the balls 8 are
rolled into the bore of the spacer lo and do not go beyond the outer diameter of
the holder. For sealing, the screw is threaded in the nut by the ass hook and par-
tially forces the balls {run the seats of the holder during sealing by the in-
creased diameter of the spacer into the annular groove of the housing. Upon fur-
ther rotation of the screw, the balls, being at rest, prevent longitudinal movement
of the holder upward and create the possibility of grasping the gasket by the clamp-
ing sleeve.

Installation of energy release monitoring sensors (DICE) through the reactor radius
is provided in 270 fuel channels. The TVS in these fuel channels are distinguished
in design from other TVS by the presence of a sealing sleeve from the pipe passing
through the center of the suspension and the fuel assembly designed for installa-
tion of the me. When installed in the channel, the on is sealed in the upper
part of the suspension by a metal gasket.

Special channels. Besides fuel channels, special channels in the following quanti-
ties are installed in the reactor:

suz channels 179
Channels with DIG in height 12
Channels of ionization staring fission chambers (ND) 4
Reflector cooling channels 156

Channels outside the fuel lattice to measure graphite temperature:

in the plateau zone 8

the SUZ channels, channels with energy release monitoring sensors in height and
channels of the ionization fission chambers (RD) do not differ from each other.
The design of these channels and their loops is identical and is shown in figure
3.6.

me suz, KD and on: channels (in height) are attached to the upper sleeve pipe by
means of a locking fillet and ”tendril” weld 3 located on the outside. There are
bellows 2 in the upper sleeves that conpensate for the considerable temperature
lengthening of the channels. determined by the temperature drop between the upper
assembled steel sections and the cold sleeve pipes. Unlike the fuel channels,

lens compensator-s 6 are installed on the lower sleeve pipes of the special channels.
The upper and lower parts of the special channels are made of corrosion-resistant
steel, while the middle part is made of zirconium-niobi alloy. The middle part
is joined to the upper and lower parts of the ch nel by steel-zirconiun adapters
similar to those of the fuel channels.

The suz channels 1 have heads 4 designed to attach the actuating mechanisms and to
deliver cooling water to the channel. The $02 actuating mechanisms 5 are attached
to the heads of the suz channels, while sealing sleeves are attached to the heads
of the DICE and 10'.) channels, also on gaskets. The sleeves in the on channels are
designed for installation of sensors and are made of SAv-l aluminum alloy and the
sleeves in the K0 channels are designed for installation of the suspensions of the
ionization fission chambers and are made of corrosion-resistant steel. A permanent
throttle valve 7 whose designation is to create resistance to water flow through
the channel that provides reliable filling of it with water, is installed in the
lower part of the special $02, on and RD channels.

The reflector cooling channel (Figure 3.7) is designed for cooling the side re-
flector of stacking 4, the upper assembled steel section of the rods for attaching

The water and steam-water distributing pipes are part of the multiple torced cir-
culation (Ms) loop in which the coolant is transported in the following manner:
water from the two delivery collectors of the main circulating pumps (GTsN) enters
44 group collectors (22 each on each side of the reactor). The water is delivered
from the group collectors through a locking-control valve and spherical flow meter
through an individual pipeline to each fuel channel. The ooolaat-steam-water mix-
ture--is fad through the upper sleeve in the fuel channel into the pipeline
through which it is fed directly into a separator. The diameter of the water
distributing pipelines is equal to 57 an and the wall thickness is 3.5 II. Guide.
movable and fixed supports and suspensions are provided to ensure the efficiency
of the pipelines. The pipelines of the steam-water distributing pipes 76 In in
diameter and with wall thickness of 4 I- are separated alternately on both sides
of the reactor. symmetrically with respect to the axial plane. The rows are ar-
ranged in layout within the upper ass-abled steel section with spacing of 250 an
and are arranged in the separator room with variable spacing of 250, 500 and 1,000
m. The corresponding connecting pipes or the separators are arranged along the

channels through pipelines located under the lower assembled steel section into a
drain collector. Docking-regulating valves and flow meters are installed on each
pipeline that delivers water to the 802. 010-: and Id) channels. The valves have
manual control. An individual throttle washer or locking-control fitting that
serves to distribute the flow rate thrOugh the channels during adjustment is in-
stalled at the inlet to the housing of each flow meter or the reflector cooling

channel. The helium-nitrogen mixture is pimped out to the purification system
through the impulse pipes during normal operation. Detection of water in the gas-
eous mixture being pumped out indicates a leak from the fuel channel.

Besides the considered distributing pipelines, there are additional pipe systems
on the bottom and top of the reactor, for example, pipelines for delivery and re-
moval of nitrogen to the different zones of the reactor and the assembled steel
sections, for delivery of the helium-nitrogen mixture (discharge of the steam-
gaseous mixture), for delivery and removal of water from the side assammed steel
sections and different drain pipes.

3 . 4 . Flow Regulators

All uranim-graphite reactors have devices which are used to maintain the flow
rate of the working media: at a specific level or to regulate the flow rate in the
required range. These devices. nuely the shutoff-regulating valves, are installed
in the first loop of the M reactor, at the inlet to each fuel channel, and are
designed to regulate the coolant flow to achieve a specific steam content. The
fluid flow rate through the object of regulation is usually varied by the throttle
valve method in nuclear and power plants.

The shutoff-regulating valve (Figure 3.8) provides the necessary regulation and
possibility of preliminary monitoring of the water flow rate through the fuel chan-
nel in all operating modes of the reactor and also cutoff of the fuel channel from
the group collector during repair of the channel or pipes of the water distributing
lines. The valves are installed in the room of the water distributing lines on the
group collectors and are connected by rods to the indicators and control levers
located behind the concrete cover. water enters the valve cavity from the group
collector, passes through the throttle valve device and the flow meter and pipe of
the water distributing line to the fuel channel. Regulation is accomplished by
changing the gap between the and piece md the seat of the throttle valve. The
valve should provide continuous reliable operation for 50,000 hours (Table 3.1).

3.5. selecting the Structural Materials and the Hater chemical Regime

The main construction materials used in an ABS with RBHK reactor are stainless and
perlite steels, zirconiun alloys and mh-S-l copper-nickel alloy. Stainless steel
oenusmo'r is one of the main construction materials of. the HF'l‘s loop (pipelines.
plating of the separator housing and part of the fuel channel). The total stain-
less steel surface in the Me loop comprises approximately 25,000 m2. Steel of
this type is used to manufacture the housings and pipe bundles of the low-pressure
heaters.

Perlite steels are used for the pipelines of the condensate-feed channel, the con-
denser housings, the heating steam pipelines and the saturated steam pipelines. The
total surface of perlite steels comprises apprOxinately 5,000 102. Perlite steel is
used in the ”91‘s loop for large shutoff fittings.

The fuel channels, suz channels and fuel elenent jackets are made of zirconium al-
loys. The total surface area of zirconium alloys is 13,500 1:2. The pipe bundles
of the turbine condensers are made of copper alloys.

The distinguishing feature of the water regime of a boiling-water reactor is in-
creased oxygen concentration in the coolant, caused by radiolysis of water in the
core. Consequently, the materials for the 1191‘s loop are selected with regard to
this circtmstance.

Neutron irradiation essentially has no effect on corrosion of 0810118le steel.
Steel corrosion is not intensified under shutdown conditions. It may be subjected
to corrosion cracking with the simltaneous presence of chlorine ions and oxygen
or another. oxidant in the medium and with the presence of tensile stresses in the
metal. Cracking was not observed in stressed metal in a median containing only one
of these agents (1] . There were no cases of corrosion cracking of the metal (at

o = 33 kgf/lm2 (330 um) during 10,000 hours of testing) in water containing 0.1-
0.3 mg/kg of oxygen and 0.1 ng/kg of the chlorine ion at 285°C and in saturated
steam containing up to 20-40 mg/kg of oxygen.

Corrosion cracking of 08KhlBNlOT steel is observed with chloride concentration on
the surface. Concentration of the chlorine ion on the surface of steel in satur-
ated steam containing up to 30-40 mg/kg of oxygen, at which corrosion cracking of
steel is observed after 6,000 hours, comprises 1'10'3 mg/cnz. There may be a phase
interface of the medium in the separator at the possible location of chlorine ion
concentration under operating conditions of an ABS with the W reactor. Howver,
compressive stresses are prevalent at the interface.

An estimate of the operating life of stainless austenitic steel wider the Operating
conditions of a boiling-water reactor, carried out according to the functions from
[2), indicate that there should be no danger of corrosion cracking in the HPTs loop
during 25-30 years of operation if normal water regime is observed. The danger of
corrosion cracking determined by chlorine-ion concentration on the outer surface of
“91‘s pipelines due to possible leaks from the outside is prevented by electrochem-
ical shielding made in the form of an alminun coating with As-sn organosilicate
material.

The assembled steel sections of the reactor of perlite steel are made with the same
coating. Extensive use of perlite steels both in the MPTs loop and in the condens-
ate-feed channel is still limited since additional purification of the coolant is
required, especially after shutdown modes. The feasibility of replacing stainless
steel by perlite steel can be solved from the results of prolonged operation.

The high corrosion resistance of the zirconium-niobium alloys used in M reac-
tors in water and steam at 285‘c is explained by their capability of passivation
as a result of protective oxide films forming [31. Zr + 1 percent Nb alloy is used
for the fuel jackets and 2R 4: 2.5 percent Nb is used for the fuel channels. The
oxygen contained in the water effects these alloys at 285°C.

Reactor radiation is a specific factor whose effect should be taken into accomt
when estimating the resistance of zirconium alloys. It was established experimen-
tally and confier theoretically that the rate of the anode process and

62

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

consequently the rate of corrosion of 2r + 2.5 percent Nb alloy increases by only
5-10 percent under reactor irradiation conditions. The rate of corrosion of 2: 4.
+ 2.5 percent Nb alloy does not exceed 0.024 g/(mz'day) during 8,000 hours of
testing. The intensity of removal of corrosion products to the coolant comprises
1-5 percent of the corrosion rate. ‘lhe efficiency of zirconium-niobim alloys in
the cosponents of the fuel channel. welded joints and adapter is determined by pro-
longed laboratory and industrial tests [4-10].

Stable operation of near reactors confirms the correctness of selecting materials
and corrosion rates of structural materials for the 191's loop. Taking the selec-
tion of construction materials in an ABS with m reactor and also the character-
istic features of the corrosion behavior of these materials into account, a cor-
rectionless water regime was selecud and calculated with provision of high purity
in the aain water loops without any correcting additions and the minimum possible
oxygen content in the coolant.

It should be noted that steady oxygen concentration due to removal of radiolysis
products and the difficulty of recombination processes has not been established
during radiolysis of water in boiling-water nuclear reactors of the m type op-
erating in a single-loop ABS circuit. The final products of water, hydrogen and
oxygen radiolysis are rauoved by the steam-water mixture to a separator. They are
delivered together with steam fros the separator to the turbine condenser where
they are removed from the loop.

'lhe radiation-chemical reactions of water in the reactor detersines the stochia-
metric yield of hydrogen and oxygen of approximately 0.6 molecules/100 av and 0.3
molecules/100 eV. respectively. In this case the oxygen concentration in the sat-
urated steal of the separator couprises approximately 10 lag/kg and that in the
water of the m loop during steady operating modes comprises 0.03-0.05 mg/kg.
Suppression of radiolysis by special hydrogen additives or hydrogen-containing
compounds for boiling-water reactors operating in the single-loop ABS circuit is

not required.

If the quality of the reactor water is normalized, it had the purpose of providing
minimum rate of corrosion of the construction materials and also minimua deposits
on the fuel elements. The standards for the quality of the feed water were deter-
mined with regard to the coefficient of concentration by evaporation of the reac-
tor water, the corrosion rate of the materials of the condensate-feed channel and
the possibility of the condensate purification. The standards adopted for the
design stage are presented in Table 3.2 for the Rank reactor.

The standards are refined and corrected during operation. Thus, upon conversion
to automatic monitoring of pa, the normal range of this indicator was expanded to
6.5-8.0 for reactor water and the standards are made more rigid for the corrosion
products of iron, copper and hardness salts. Many years of operating ABS with the
arm reactor showed that the real water regime is considerably better than the
planned regime. The indicators of the water of the MP'rs loop are presented below:

Specific electric conductivity, novels 0.4-0.6
Content, mg/kg:
of chlorine ions 10.05
of iron 10
of copper 7-10

Sources of entry of contaminants into the coolant were considered when selecting
the means of maintaining the water regime and measures to control this were deter-
mined with regard to the physicochasical characteristics of their behavior in the
ABS loop. All contaminants of the coolant of a single-loop boiling-water ass can
essentially be divided into three main groups: saline, finely dispersed (corrosion
byproducts) and gaseous. he entry of saline impurities during operation of a
plant should be expected as a result of selection of cooling water in the turbine
condensers and also with the feed water.

Corrosion byproducts enter the coolant from the entire surface of the loop in all
operating modes of the ABS and the corrosion byproducts should be removed from the
coolant due to their relatively low solubility and capability of precipitation.

The main source of entry of gaseous impurities is radiolysis of water in the reac-
tor core. High purity of water with low specific electric conductivity (less than
1 UCm/cm) is provided by desalinisation of it on ion-exchange filters. Therefore.
the entire flow of the turbine condensate. the heating steam condensate of the re-
generative turbine heaters and also the additive chemically desalinised water pass
through condensate purification. It operates by the series-connection scheme of
the mechanical and mixed ion-exchange filters. The condition of loo percent con-
densate purification of all flows comprising the feed water is strictly observed in
this case. It is especially important to observe this condition with highly miner-
alized (sea) cooling water of the turbine condensers. A mixture of 1:1 m-Z-Gchs
and Av-l'l-Bchs ion exchangers is used as the load of the ion-exchange filter.
Special attention is devoted to the condensate density, which permits Operation
with influxes of cooling water less than 0.0001 percent.

since the dissolved impurities in the feed water are concentrated in the MP‘l‘s loop
in proportion to the coefficient of concentration by evaporation, purging of part

64

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

of the reactor water with replacement of it by cleaner water is required to main-
tain the given standards. There is intraloop purification in the RBHK reactor
that operates by the series-connection scheme of alluvial aechanical and ion-ex-
change filters with mixed load. Water for purification is collected from the 61‘s“
head and is delivered to the feed water line at its inlet to the separators. men
estimating the amount of purging water, the required flow rate to maintain each
indicator of the reactor water within normal limits was calculated. An equation
was derived in which the nuber of corrosion byproducts settling in the loop was
taken into account when calculating the amount of scavenging water. The water is
contaminated most by iron corrosion byproducts and a scavenging water flow rate of

180 t/hr (productivity of intraloop purification) was selected according to the
content.

Water is purified of oxygen in the turbine condensers and in a deserator. Hors-
over, there is blowoff of the noncondensed gases. including oxygen, from the hous-
ings of the regenerative turbine heaters. These measures ensure an oxygen content
of not sore than 0.05 mg/kg in the water after condensate purification and of not
more than 0.03 mg/kg in the feed water after the deaerator.

The water regime of the 502 loop with complete filling of the channels with water
is determined by the corrosion resistance of the main construction material-«lu-
inum alloy, for which the pH should be in the range of 5.5-6.5. This pa in the
loop is created by radiation-chemical reaction of nitrate-ion formation from nitro-
gen and oxygen that enter the water as a result of air being dissolved in it in the
open tanks of the loop. There is a purification system consisting of a mechanical
filter and ion-exchange filter with mixed load of m-Z-Ochs and AV-l‘I-echs to main-
tain the salt impurities and corrosion byproducts within normal limits. A purifi-
cation productivity of 10 t/hr is sufficient to maintain water quality better than
provided by the standards (Table 3.3). The results of operation confirm the cor-
rectness of selecting construction materials. the water-chemical regime of the
plant and also the feasibility of combining the system of indicator monitoring of
the materials with inspections of the equipment upon evaluation of the resistance
of the materials.

The water quality of the RBHK reactor is monitored by automatic devices with flow-
through sensors and by laboratory methods of analyzing water samples. The auto-
matic devices monitor the content of the most important indicators of the water
regime, measurement of which introduces greater and nonspecific errors without
automatic devices with flow-through sensors. These indicators should include the
specific electric conductivity of the water measured by a type Alt-310 conductometer
and pH measured by the potsntiometric method using a type pH-ZOl device. The set

of the device includes flow-through sensors and secondary devices with constant
recording of the indicators.

The chlorine ion concentration is measured by the potentiometric nethod using the
LTI-TslcrI laboratory device, and also the argentometric and nephelometric methods
of analysis. The triloaetric method with reverse titration is used to measure the
hardness salt concentration. Low concentrations of hardness salts (less than 1
ug-eqv/kg) are determined by the simulator scale. The concentration of iron cor-
rosion byproducts is recorded by the orthophenathroline method, while determina-
tion of the copper content is based on its reaction with lead diethyldithiocarbon-
ate. The basis of the eethod of determining silicon dioxide is formation of
complex silicomolybdemm acid. The content of radiolytic products of water-oxygen
and oxygen decomposition is measured by means of chromatographs whose operating
principle is based on chromatographic separation of gases from water.

3.6. Thermal and Hydraulic Characteristics
3.6.1. The Deteruuning Heat Engineering Parameters.

The main heat engineering factors that determine the efficiency of a uranium-
graphite boiling-water reactor are the tenperature of the nuclear fuel, the graph-
ite temperature of the stacking and the reserve to critical output of the fuel
channel in which a heat transfer crisis begins. Moreover, hydrodynamic stability
of the reactor is required.

An excess of permissible fuel temperature or the occurrence of a heat transfer
crisis may lead to failure of an individual fuel assembly, but after it is replaced
the reactor efficiency is restored. If there is an m, then the defective assem-
bly can be replaced in an operating reactor without reducing its power. However,
despite the possibility of rather rapid restoration of reactor efficiency, failure
of a fuel assembly is qualified as a reactor failure since it leads to resovsl of
the assenbly and to deterioration of the radiation situation at the A55. The ab-
sence o- catastrophic consequences of emergencies related to failure of individual
TVS provides the possibility during design of a reactor and also during operation
to be oriented toward proability-statistical methods of determining the maximum
fuel temperature and the reserve to critical output of the fuel channel.

The probability-statistical method takes into account the random nature of the co-
efficients related to the error of manufacturing the core elements, the accuracy
of measuring the parameters that affect the determining factors, the accuracy of
maintaining operating nodes and so on. This approach permits one to substantiate
the considerably lower reserves to permissible values of parameters than those
which the limiting method yields and is new employed extensively in the practice
of reactor construction. The state of the cores of RBMX reactors during operation
is also monitored on the basis of probability-statistical methods.

If failure of individual fuel elements and of fuel assemblies is permitted when
determining the reserves to critical output and maximtm fuel teaperature, one must
proceed from the condition of providing its efficiency during the entire operating
period of the reactor when calculating the permissible temperature of the graphite
stacking. Failure of the stacking means failure of the reactor for a prolonged

66

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USS ONLY

period. For this reason the maximum graphite temperature is calculated and it

is determined during operation by using the limiting method when all the parameters
affecting the temperature conditions of the stacking deviate in the unfavorable di-
rection toward the maximum possible values.

The marinas permissible temperature of the graphite stacking is assigned on the
basis of existing experience of operating uranium-graphite reactors and depends on
the composition of the gas filling the stacking and the amount of water entering
the stacking from nonpressurized channels. The composition of the filler gas and
the amount of water and water vapor in the stacking are measured continuously dur-
ing reactor operation and the value of the maximum permissible temperature is cor-
rected as a function of the operating conditions. The condition that the maximum
graphite temperature should not exceed the threshold temperature at which oxidation
of the graphite in the presence of water vapor in the stacking is no longer linear-
ly dependent on temperature but proceeds more intensively, in all operating modes
of the reactor was adopted in practice. The experience of operating existing uran-
ium-graphite reactors shows that the efficiency of the graphite stacking during the
entire operating period of the reactor is reliably provided if this condition is
observed.

3.6.2. Hydraulics of the Circulating loop and Heat Transfer in the Reactor core

The hydraulic characteristics of the circulating loop of a uranium-graphite boiling-
water reactor consist of the following hydraulic characteristics: the fuel channel
(including delivery and drain pipelines). the cutoff-regulating valve at the inlet
to the channel and the drain channel (drain pipelines, collectors and circulating
pumps of the fittings).

The hydraulic characteristics of the fuel channel of the m reactor were deter-
mined on a full-scale simulator bench with thermal output of 6 m. The heater
pipes on the bench were remotely controlled by lattices whose design was similar to
that of the spacer caponents of the reactor. The results were obtained over a
wide range of variation of the regime parameters. The method of calculating the
coefficient of frictional drag of the heated bundle of rods located in the two-
phase coolant flow was developed along with this.

Additional experiments were conducted on special benches to determine the coeffi-
cient of hydraulic drag of the spacer lattices, as a result of which the dependence
of the coefficient of hydraulic drag of the lattices on Reynolds number was deter-
mined; no effect of the mass steam content of the coolant on the hydraulic drag
coefficient was found. The frictional drag on the heated bundle of rods was de-
termined during two-phase flow of the coolant with regard to the pressure losses on
the spacer lattices, to acceleration of the flow and to overcome the levelling
drop. The experimental data obtained in this manner were then compared to the re-
sults of calculations by different methods. Processing of the experimental and
calculated material made it possible to select the method for calculating the co-
efficient of frictional drag of the heated bundle of rods washed by a two-phase
flow having the least error at flow parameters close to the working parameters of
the reactor [11]. The pressure loss to friction is determined by this method from

the equation:

Cold tests of a large series of shutoff-regulating valves were conducted at the de-
sign stage of the m reactor, as a result of which it was established that the
design of the valves provides the identity of their hydraulic characteristics in
the form Q/v‘APn . uh), where Q is the volt-eerie flow rate. APlu is the pressure
drop in the valve and h is the degree of opening. The calculated and experimental
data obtained on the reactor of the first unit of the Leningrad A38 for the hy-

The results of comparison show satisfactory agreenent of calculation and experin-t.

The hydraulic characteristics of the descending loop, the intake delivery collec-
tors and the distributing collectors and fittings were determined with regard to
bench and model tests of the corresponding equipment.

The critical output of the fuel channel of a uraniu-graphite boiling-water reactor
was calculated by the function determined as a result of analysis and processing
of experimental results and by the heat transfer crisis in the bundles of heated
rods, obtained on bench models and on a full-scale bench of the reactor channel.
The experiments were conducted on benches with different configuration of the bun-
dles with coolant parameters close to the working parameters of the reactor. A
function sinilar to that recon-sanded in [12] was selected as the calculating func-
tion to determine the conditions for the occurrence of a heat transfer crisis in
the fuel channels at the design stage of the R310: reactor. The mean square error
of the calculating formula comprised 8.7 percent with respect to the experimental
data available at the same time. This correlation is used in programs for nonitor-

Further experiments to investigate the phenomenon of the heat transfer crisis in
the channels of a uraniua-graphite boiling-water reactor were conducted toward re-
fining the calculating formula. Malysis and processing of the accumulated exper-
imental material made it possible to optimise the coefficients of the formula,
which in turn made it possible to increase the calculated value of the critical
output of the fuel channels by 5-7 percent. Despite the relatively small increase
of the calculated critical power. refinement of the function to determine an is
reasible since it has a positive effect on the operating and engineeringand eco-
nomic indicators of the reactor. The formula now reconnended to calculate “kr in

liminary analyses, this will make it possible to increase the calculated value of
N.“ by an additional 5-7 percent. Consideration of the nonuniformity of energy
release through the height of uranim-graphite boiling-water M reactors presents
no difficulties since a system for monitoring the energy release field through the
height of the core is provided.

3.6.3. The Heat Engineering Omaracteristics of a Reactor at Steady Power Levels

The reserves to critical power and the temerature mode of the fuel assembly fuel
and the graphite stacking of the nu: reactor is monitored during operation and
steady power levels by a special Prisms program using the plant cosputer. The
readings of the physical mnitoring system, based on intrareactor measurements of
the neutron flux through the radius and height of the core, are used to calculate
the energy release distribution through the core. Besides the readings of the
physical mnitoring system, the data that characterize the composition of the core,
energy generation of each fuel asseably, the position of the control rode, the
distribution of water flow rates through the fuel channels measured by a special
monitoring system, the readings of thermocouples located in different zones of the
graphite stacking and that measure the graphite tesperature and also the readings
of the coolant pressure and temperature sensors are entered into the computer.

As a result of calculations by the Prisms program carried out periodically by the
coaputer upon instructions of the operator, he obtains information on a digital
printer in the form of a cartogram of the core in which the type of charge of the
core, the position of the control rods, the grid for arrangement of intrareactor
sensors, power distribution, water flow rates and reserves to critical power for
each fuel channel are indicated. The plant cowuter also calculates the maxim
fuel and graphite temperature and indicates the meters of the channels in which
these temperatures occur, the total thermal pover of the reactor, the steam con-
tent at the output from each fuel channel and other parameters required to monitor
and control the reactor.

When the reactor is operating at steady power levels and also during a rise or fall
of power, the operator simultaneously with monitoring and control of the energy re-
lease field controls the distribution of water flow rates through the fuel channels
of the core. Distribution of flow rates is established on the basis of calculating
the distribution of reserves to critical power K, through the fuel channels by the
Prizma program: the permissible value of K, .>_ 1, and the probability of a heat
transfer crisis in the fuel channel cosprises 0.0013 at K. - 1. This value has now
been checked by the practice of operating existing RBMK reactors, but it can be
subsequently corrected toward an increase as statistical material is accomulated.

The need for simultaneous control of the energy release field and distribution of
the water flow rate through the fuel channels of a uranius-graphite boiling-water
reactor is determined by the large degree of nuclear fuel burnup and the possibil-
ity of recharging the fuel in an operating reactor. In this case the burned-up
and “fresh” TVS are operated simultaneously. As a result the core structure is
complicated with maratively large nonuniformity of the energy release fields
through the reactor radius and it becomes impossible to use the traditional equal-
ization of energy release fields with fixed radial profiling of water flow rates.

Consequently, profiling of the energy release fields and of the water flow rates
by algorithms that take into account the real specific conditions occurring during
reactor operation is required for effective operation of a uranium-graphite boil-
ing-water reactor.

Regulation of the water flow rates through the fuel channels during a nuclear fuel
run makes it possible to provide adequate reserves to the heat transfer crisis in
the channels thermal-stressed to the maximum with acceptable general water flow
rate through the reactor. The calculated dependence of the main parameters of the
RBMK reactor operating in the continuous fuel recharging node on the nuuber of
regulations of water flow rate through each channel is presented in Figure 3.ll.

It is shown in the figure that the probability of at least one of the reactor chan-
nels entering the heat transfer crisis node (R - l - 8) decreases initially with an
increase of the number of regulations and than the value of R becomes stabilized
with an increase in the number of regulations above 3. The optimum nunber of reg-
ulations of water flow rate through each channel found in this manner, equal to

2-3 regulations during the run, is acceptable in the continuous fuel recharging
node.

The nonuniformity of the energy release fields can be coaparatively high during
transition from the initial charge of the core to a charge corresponding to the
continuous fuel recharging node, which leads to the need to increase either the
number of regulations of the water flow rate through each channel or the total
water flow rate through the reactor (within the capability of the circulating
pumps). The main parameters of the mm reactor of the first unit of the Leningrad
ass during operation and nominal power in the transient core charging node are pre-
sented below:

Electrical output of unit, m 1,000
1herma1 output of reactor, HR 3,130
umber of channels with TVS 1,478
Number of channels with DP 215
Output of most heat-stressed channel, kw 3,010
Haximun linear thermal flux, kit/n 41
niniuum reserve to critical power 1.01
Maximum temperature of graphite stacking, °c 570
water flow rate through reactor, t/hr 42,000
Mean mass steam content, percent 13
Water temperature at inlet to reactor, 'c 270
steam pressure in separators, kgf/un2 69

The water flow rate through the reactor can be regulated by two methods: by chang-
ing the degree of opening of the throttle-regulating valves installed at the pres-
sure head of each G‘i‘sN and also by changing the degree of opening of the channel
shutoff-regulating valves. The throttle-regulating valves are fully opened at
nominal power level and the water flow rate through the GrsN is maintained in the
range of 6,000-7,000 n3/hr at power less than 150 an (electricity) to provide the
required reserve to cavitation. Due to the fact that the reactor is started up at
reduced productivity of the 01‘s", the distribution of water flow rates through the
core channels is determined by calculation during this period on an external com-
puter such that an adequate reserve to critical output in each fuel channel is
provided when it is brought up to nominal power. when bringing the reactor up to
power, the flow rate distribution through the fuel channels is corrected from the
results of calculations made by the Prirma program on the plant computer.

The experience of operating existing am: reactors showed that the design of the
graphite stacking and of the fuel elements at available thermal loads provides
maximum graphite and fuel temperatures considerably less than the maxinun persis-
eible values. The temperature mode of the stacking depends on how well the ther-
mal contact between the graphite block and the fuel channel pipe, to which heat
from the graphite is dissipated, is organized. The developed design of cut graph-
ite rings, from which one is installed with negative allowance on the channel pipe
and the other is calculated for negative allowance through the inner opening in
the graphite block, provided good heat dissipation from the stacking and the pos-
sibility of installation and renoval of the channel pipe during the entire reactor
operating time. With nitrogen filling the acceptable temperature mode of the
graphite at temperatures up to 750°C is provided to outputs of 800-850 MW (elec-
tricity). At higher outpuu, the stacking is filled with a helium and nitrogen
mixture. In this case the maximal: graphite temperature comprises approximately
600’c when operating at nominal power.

The value of the maximum fuel temperature determined by calculation using the
readings of physical monitoring sensors comprised l,800-2,000'C at nominal reactor
power, which is considerably lower than the melting point of uranium dioxide.

Along with monitoring the reserves to critical power and the temperature mode of
the graphite and fuel. selective monitoring of the fuel jacket temperatures is pro-
vided in the new: reactor under conditions of possible scale fomtion and deposits
of corrosion byproducts on the heat-transfer surfaces. Reference thermometer as-
semblies supplied with thermocouples located at different points along the height
and radius of the fuel assembly are installed for this purpose in the reactor core.
The temperature mode of the fuel jackets both in an operating reactor and during
repair operations is monitored and studied from the readings of the thermocouples.

3.7. Investigating the Strength of the Equipment and Pipelines

Complex engineering problems related to providing the strength of the equipment
and pipelines must be solved during design of an A88 [13]. This complexity is de-
termined on the one hand by the use of new materials not having wide distribution
in ordinary machine building and not adequately studied, for example, zirconium-
based alloys. On the other hand, the conditions of inserting parts in atomic re-
actors and the related systems differ considerably from those encountered in the
practice of operating thermoelectric power plants. This refers primarily to the
effect of neutron irradiation on material, as a result of which the plasticity of
the material decreases, it becomes ubrittled and creep processes are intensified.

The possibility of structures failing due to damage during prolonged static and
cyclic loading and extreme deformations acctmulated during creep and brittle fail-
ure initiated from the zones of different defects, should be considered when de-
signing structures operating under various load conditions and in different oper-
ating modes [14]. The problems of creep are of important significance for such
components as fuel channel pipes manufactured from zirconium alloys. The criteria
of cyclic strength determine the efficiency of the structural zones in which con-
ditions of repeated elastoplastic deformation are realized such as the zones of
openings, transfer of fluids, threads, joining of connecting pipes to vessels and
so on. Materials become brittle due to the effect of irradiation and thermal and
deformation aging and brittle failure of the structures is possible if there are
defects in them that exceed specific critical dimensions.

Since the components and assemblies of the Ms loop are subject during operation
to the effect of a wideband spectrum of disturbing high~frequency dynamic forces
occurring due to the effect of the flow of the working medium, problems of provid-
ing vibration strength acquire special timeliness.

The steam-water mixture at the output from the fuel channel contains a large amount
of oxygen (8-10 lag/liter), which requires that problems of corrosion-mechanical
strength receive special consideration. Contact of the coolant with the fuel chan-
nel pipes leads to separation of oxygen due to the corrosive metal-water reaction
and to absorption of it in the zirconium alloys with formation of brittle inclu-
sions--plates of zirconium hydride.

1he indicated features of the behavior of material from which the components of the
equipment and pipelines of the 14m loop are manufactured and the operating condi-
tons predetermine the need for investigations to ensure the strength of the equip-
ment and pipelines of ABS with arm: reactors. According to the "Standards for
Calculation of Reactor Components, Steam Generators, Vessels and Pipelines of Atom-
ic Power Plants, Experimental and Research Nuclear Reactors and Plants for strength"
[151, all the components of the reactor plant were calculated. The steady modes,
the heating-cooling modes, hydraulic tests, disruptions of normal operating condi-
tions and emergency situations related to consequences caused by a hypothetical
emergency at an ass, were considered as the main calculated modes. Bach mode was
characterized by the value and rate of variation of pressure and tnperature of the
coolant in time and the number of repeat cycles during the service life of the
reactor.

Thermal calculations showed that no significant temperature gradients occur in the
equipment and pipeline both inthe steady and transient modes. Temperature stresses

occur mainly in the zones where materials of different structural classes as joined
(steel-zirconium, carbon steel-austenitic steel). The stresses determined by cal-
culation were compared to the permissible stresses for the corresponding categories
of stresses. This detailed differentiation of stresses permits reliable estimation
of the strength, but requires the application of special methods of calculating the

stress state. Programs for nuerical calculation on a computer were usually the
basis of these methods.

The analysis showed that all the components of the reactor unit meet the require-
ments of normal calculation for strength and at the same time revealed the struc-
tural assemblies whose stress state required experimental confirmation. aperi-
mental investigations were carried out using models of optically sensitive
materials. plexiglass, metal and also direct measurement of deformations (tenso-
metric measurement) on operating ABS during starting-adjusting operations.

Thus, tensometric measurmaents of descent pipelines, the large-diameter pipes of
the G'rsN framing, the intake, delivery and distributing collectors, the pipes of
the steam-water distributing lines, the fuel channels, separators and assembled
steel sections were made during adjustment, startup and operation of the first units
of the Leningrad and Chernobyl' ass. The analysis of the given tensometric measure-
ments confirmed the conclusions of strength calculations on the nature of stress
distribution and its values.

Vibration parameters were measured simultaneously with tensometric monuments to
investigate the characteristics of the vibration strength of structures. check-
points of the measurements were selected on the basis of the results of preliminary
analysis of the behavior of the structures-at points where pipelines were joined
and at fixed supports in the middle part of pipeline runs. It turned out that vi-
brational stresses in the investigated structural components are very low and do
not exceed 1.2 kgf/cm2 (approximately 12 HPa) in transient operating modes and

0.5 kgf/cm2 (approximately 5 HPe) in steady operating modes of the reactor. no sig-
nificant vibrations of the fuel channels and also of the 1115 located in them were
found.

The reactor unit is operated under conditions of a combination of steady and
transient modes. The number of cyclically repeated modes, the range of pressure
and temperature variation and the rate of variation directly determine the fatigue
resistance of the stmctures. The method of cyclic strength calculation was regu-
lated by standards for strength calculation. The experimental investigations main-
ly concerned problens which are not reflected in existing standards. For exuple,
a great deal of attention see devoted to problems of the cyclic strength of a dif-
fusion steel-zirconitmt welded joint since significant cyclically variable tespera-
ture stresses that exceed the yield point of the material occur in it under operat-
ing conditions. '

The zirconium-niobiua alloy used to manufacture the components of the fuel channel
is characterized by high plasticity in the initial state, but plasticity may de-
crease during operation due to hydrogenation and neutron irradiation. The corre-
sponding investigations were conducted to study the effect of the indicated factors
on the fatigue strength, fatigue curves were found and it was shown that the given
operating life of the fuel channels is provided by the number of transient nodes.
similar tests and estimates were also made for welded zirconium-zirconium joints.
Direct experiments on cyclic loading by inteer pressure and temperature of full-
scale mockups of fuel channels under bench conditions confirmed the correctness of
the conclusions made.

A number of pipelines of the HPTs loop of corrosion-resistant chrome-nickel
oarmemor steel was protected by an anticorroeion aluminum coating that forms a
brittle interlayer of intermetallic compounds whose thickness increases during
operation in the contact zone with the base metal. The coefficients of a decrease
of fatigue strength, caused by the effect of this interlayer, were determined in
special experiunts which were used in making the strength calculations.

The possibility of developing the permissible standards for quality control of the
production flaws in fuel channel pipes and pipelines of the delivery and intake
channels of the GTsN were investigated. Data on the kinetics of fatigue cracks
in 2r + 2.5 percent to: alloy, steel of mark 22K and the welded joints of these
materials were used for this purpose. The analyses showed that there is no basis
to doubt that the given service life of the components of the MPTs loop will be
provided if the possible development of defects due to cyclic loading under oper-
ating conditions is taken into account.

The use of Zr + 2.5 percent Nb alloy as the material of the central part of the
fuel channel pipe required that an extensive complex of experimental work be car-
ried out to analyze its creep strength and ultimate strength. The investigations
were conducted both under laboratory and under reactor conditions. The extreme
creep of fuel channel pipes may lead, on the one hand, to selection of gaps be-
tween the pipes and stacking of the reactor and on the other hand, to exhaustion of
the plastic limit of the material with subsequent failure. It is known that ir-
radiation intensifies creep processes at relatively low stresses and temperatures
up to 325°C and the rats of creep is directly proportional to the influence of fast
neutrons. The anisotropy of the properties of zirconim alloys may lead to the
fact that the lengths of the fuel channel pipes may be increased under operating
conditions. All these circumstances were taken into account when estimating the
creep strength of the pipes. The analysis conducted with specific assumptions

resulting in a strength reserve showed that the maxim increase of the fuel
channel pipe dimter over a period of 25 years of operation will not exceed the
permissible increase.

It was established upon study of the variation of the ultimate plasticity of

Zr + 2.5 percent Nb alloy that plasticity characterized by relative elongation of
a specimen during failure is increased over time. Deformations on the order of
5-10 percent were achieved without failure in fuel channel pipes during experiments
under irradiation conditions. The ultimate strength of rirconim alloys increases
upon exposure to radiation and the data of laboratory tests of unirradiated speci-
msnts can be used as the strength reserve to estimate the ultimate strength. It
follows from theoretical estimates and processing of experimental data using the
Larson-Miller parameter that the given operating life of a fuel channel is provid-
ed by the criterion of ultimate strength [16]. Calculated estimates and “peri-
mental data obtained by foreign authors shows that an increase in the length of
the fuel channel is possible, which must be taken into account when designing the
system for temperature compensation of the channels.

calculated stress in fuel channel

Pipes manufactured from zr + 2.5 percent Nb alloy become brittle primarily due to
the effect of hydrogenation and irradiation. A shift of critical brittleness tem-
perature (much) of Zr + 2.5 percent Nb alloy and of its welded joints due to the
effect of hydrogenation even to a relatively low degree (0.02-0.03 percent by mass)
encompasses practically the entire temperature range of fuel channel operation.
Irradiation also changes the lmth toward positive temperatures and is greater, the
lower the degree of hydrogenation. The maximum value of m comprises about 350°C
and does not vary with subsequent increase of the degree of hydrogenation and ef-
fluent of neutrons [9]. A high value of K‘l'Kh indicates the essential possibility
of brittle failure of zirconium pipes and requires that the corresponding analysis
of the possibility of this failure be carried out. The critical opening of the
crack 6‘: was taken as the main characteristic for estimating the brittle failure

strength of the material.

Hydrogenation significantly reduces the value of 6;; at temperatures on the order
of 20'c and essentially has no effect on 6: at temperatures above 300°C. Special
investigations of specimens cut from pipes of experimental fuel channels of the
first unit of the Beloyarskaya ABS were conducted to study the effect of irradia-
tion on die. It was determined that irradiation has a significant effect on 6c

and reduces its value over the entire investigated temperature range (20-300'c).
There is no subsequent decrease of 6c after hydrogenation to 0.04 percent by mass
and after neutron flux of 1020-1031 neutrons/“2.

A diagram for calculating zirconium-niobiu pipes for brittle failure strength
(Figure 3.12) was constructed on the basis of the data obtained. The nature of
stress variation in the fuel channel pipe during operation (curve 4) is shown ar-
bitrarily. Curve 4 lies below the curve of the stresses permissible during opera-
tion (curve 3) over the entire range of operating temperatures, which means that
brittle failure strength of the fuel channel pipes will be provided.

Another important component of the m loop of the Rm reactor, failure of which
is a very serious emergency: are the delivery and intake pipelines with Dy - 800
mm. The investigations permitted construction of the failure diagram of pipelines
with Dy = 800 m. presented in Figure 3.13 (17]. Curves 1-7 were plotted for sur-
face defects of different depth. If a defect exists in the structure and its
dimensions and also the stresses in the structure are such that a point with cor-
responding coordinates is located below curve 8, then only a leak can form in the
structure. The plotted diagram was confirmed by the results of testing full-scale
straight pipes and elbows with by - 800 am with different surface cuts.

Consideration of the failure diagram permits one to conclude that a leak forms in
the pipelines at writing pressure of 85-90 kgt’/cn2 (approximately 8.7 HPa) if the
defect in it with length of 21 - 470 III reaches a depth equal to 0.75 of the wall
thickness.

The service life and operating conditions of the equipment and pipelines of the
reactor unit were selected on the basis of complex calculation-experimental inves-
tigations of the strength and efficiency of components of the Ma loop that en-
compass study of practically all possible failure sources.

Operating Conditions and Main Characteristics

High requirements on reliability during the entire service life are placed on the
fuel elements and TVS. The couplexity of realizing then is aggravated by the fact
that the length of the channel is 7,000 n with relatively seell diameter and ne-
chine recharging of the ease-hues both in a shutdown and in an operating reactor
should be provided. The stressful operating conditions of the TVS in reactors of
the described type predetemine the need to conduct a large couple): of prereactor
and reactor tests. The min parameters that characterize the operating conditions

of TVS are as follows:

A Tvs consists of 18 rod-type fuel elements, a housing and attaching parts: the
TVS are interchangeable. the housing is a central pipe on which are installed one
end and 10 spacer lattices. The and lattice is attached to the central pipe by
beading the pipe and serves to attach the fuel elements by clamping sleeves. The
nine spacer lattices are held in the central pipe by means of projections (pressing
the protruding end of the central cell into the grooves on the pipe) . which permit
them to move along the axis for a distance of approximately 3.5 III upon thermal
expansion of the fuel elements. One outer spacer lattice is attached to a key to
increase the stiffness against twisting of the bundle.

The spacer lattice is a honeycomb structure and is assembled from the central, six
intermediate and 12 peripheral cells and a rin joined to each other by spot weld-
ing. Spacer projections are provided on the rim.

The end of the central pipe of the housing has a rectangular cut to half the diam-
eter. The TVS are joined to each other such that the projectionof the pipe of one
TVS enters the cut of the other. This provides coaxiality of the fuel elements of
two W5 and eliminates rotation of then with respect to each other.

The fuel elemnts are rigidly attached to the end lattices of the TVS (on the wper
and lower boundaries of the core) and the clearance in the center of the core is
selected during operation as a result of thermal expansion. The fuel element con-
sists of a jacket with fuel pellets of uraniua dioxide. a lower end plug. cylindri-
cal compression spring, sleeve with opening and end cap. The fuel element is
sealed by electron beam and argon-arc welding. The inner cavity of the fuel ele-
ment is filled with an argon and helium mixture.

Reducing the distance between the fuel pellets in the center of the core sakes it
possible to reduce the spurge of heat release and thus to reduce the teaperature
of the fuel and the structural material in the zone of the fuel elensnt end plugs.
The use of two sections through the height of the core leads to the fact that the
fuel elements of each section operate both in the maximum and in the nininus zone
of energy release in height. In this case the inner pressure in the fuel elements
corresponds to the average fuel tenperature through the height.

5.2. Results of Main Experimental work to Analyze the Reliability of the NS

The majority of problems arising during development of the design was solved by
simulation or direct checking. Experimental investigations on electrically heated
models were conducted to confirm the heat engineering reliability. Experiments
were first conducted on a three-rod bundle and then on bmdles with 3. 7 and 19
simulators, but of the shortest length. with simulation of the TVS cell of the m
The purpose of these experiments was to investigate the effect of the nuber of rob
on the occurrence of a heat transfer crisis, which was not found. The tests on a
full-scale bench with electrically heated model of a standard assembly with param-
eters similar to those of the new: channel were the final tests.

One of the determining factors of the efficiency of fuel elements is the permissi-
ble temperature of the inner surface of the and plug of the fuel element in the
center of the core. The temperature distribution in the and plug, fuel and jacket
and also the thermal flux density in the region of a heat release surge at the
point where the TVS are joined, was deteinined on a coqmter by the electrical
analogy method. Experiments showed that the maximum tseperature of the and plug

in contact with the fuel does not exceed SZO‘C and that on the outer surface does
not exceed 330’C, while the temperature in the center of the fuel increases slight-
ly within permissible limits for the zirconium alloys used.

wind tunnel tests were conducted for cooperative selection of the designs of the
spacer and end lattices. The selected versions were investigated in water and in
a steam-water mixture to find the calculating functions of the frictional coeffi-
cients in the bundle to determine the local resistance coefficients. The hydro-
dynamic characteristics of the am TVS were calculated from these data. Omfir-
nation of the calculation results was obtained upon testing on a full-scale bench.

The zirconium alloys used as fuel jackets and other parts of the TVS were investi-
gated for efficiency. Autoclave and dynamic tests of the alloys , welded joints
and also the steel-zirconiun adapter available in an assembly with on were con-
ducted to check the corrosion behavior of the selected alloys during operation in
a steam-water mixture. The quality of the coolant. identical to the design qual-
ity for the M reactor, was provided during testing. The tests confirmed their
suitability for operation in the TVS structure. The materials underwent a final
check during reactor tests of the fuel elements and TVS. The results permitted
the conclusion that the properties of the selected zirconiun alloys are satisfac-
tory and that these properties are retained over a service life of 5 years. A
considerable part of the experimental investigations was conducted to check the
conformity of the actual efficiency of individual assemblies and of the design as
a whole to the requirements placed on them during different operating modes of the
TVS.

The program of preliminary strength investigations envisioned the determination of
the mechanical properties of the materials used and of the structural strength of
the parts and assemblies. The load diagrams corresponded to the assew1y operat-
ing conditions in the channel and also to the various possible situations during
recharging and transport. Thus, cases of seizing or "jasming" of the assembly in
the channel during unloading after prolonged operation were considered. In this
case the most crucial supporting parts should have a tenfold strength reserve.

The less crucial parts and joints were designed for lower strength reserves. The
most dangerous force acting on the assembly in the channel during reactor opera-
tion is vibration of the fuel elements and the assembly as a whole, which occurs
as a result of pressure fluctuations of the coolant during flow past obstacles of
the end part and lattice type.

Different versions of the design were compared from the results of model tests on
a two-component vibration table. The vibrational frequency and the dynamic load
were selected on the basis of the experience of previous developments and of ap-
proximate calculation of the frequency of natural vibrations of the rods and sup-
ports along the length. The model to be tested was placed in a steel channel with
inner diameter of 80 an, filled with distilled water. Strain gauges whose readings
were recorded wre glued to the fuel element simulators. The quality of the spacer
lattice was determined by visual inspection and by measurement of the dimensions
before and after the tests and also by the condition of the zirconiun fuel jackets
under the lattices. Tests of the finally selected lattice design on a vibration
table showed their reliability and there was essentially no wear of the fuel jack-
ets. All the joints of the assembly were checked and reguiresents on their manu-
facture were developed during the vibrational tests. The effect of vibration of
the fuel element core on the wear of the inner surface of the jacket was investi-
gated visually. No significant changes in the jacket were found and the pellets
also retained their configuration.

The effect of temperature lengthening on the efficiency of the design was investi-
gated to investigate the mechanical loads on the assembly during startups and
shutdowns of the reactor. It is obvious that the fuel element jackets reach a
higher temperature when brought to power than the central pipe or the carrier rod.
The temperatures should become equalized upon cooling (shutdown). An experiment
was conducted on a model in which the central rod was made of steel and the jackets
of the fuel elenmnt simulators were made of zirconium to determine the effect of
thermal fluctuations. The model was cyclically heated and cooled. The difference
in the linear expansions of steel and sirconiua simulated the difference of the
thermal expansions of the fuel elements and the housing. The test results con-
firmed the reliability of the TVS design.

A nuuber of experimental investigations to check the efficiency of the near TVS
was conducted on full-scale models of the assemblies. 3 special bench was designed
and manufactured to analyze the efficiency of the assembly during loading into the
reactor channels and removal from them. The bench made it possible to simulate the
deformation of the fuel channel. which is possible during installation and opera-
tion, and also the different fracture angles at points where individual sections
of the channel are welded. The channel was deformed by the clapping sleeves in
two mutually perpendicular directions and it was fractured by the flange connectors
of the channel. A full-scale model of the assembly was tested and the mass of the
assembly corresponded to the real mess. The mockup of the assembly was suspended
on a dynamaaeter and was inserted into the channel at different rates and in this
case the mean statistical forces of loading and unloading were determined for each
shape and degree of bending of the channel.

The spacer lattices were not damaged during motion of the assembly at rate of
3 m/min if the junctions were tapered with an angle of 60‘ at the vertex: therate of

travel of the cassette had to be reduced with smaller acute angle. The beads of
the welded seams have no configuration that can be checked: therefore. special re-
quirements were placed on the quality of manufacture of the channel. A rate of
travel of the assembly up to 10 m/min could be assused permissible on the smooth
sections of the channel. This was confirmed by loading of full-scale assnbliee
into the fuel channels of the reactor of the first unit of the Ieningrad ass prior
to standard charging of the apparatus. The dynamic characteristics of the ass-ably
were also determined on the bench and it was established that the assemblies did
not fail even with parts embrittled due to artificial hydrogenation when the assem-
bly dropped into the channel from a height of 0.5 meter and with rigid stopping
during travel at a rate of 10 m/min.

a complex check of the efficiency of the assemblies was made on an operating life
test bench. A full-scale assembly was placed in a fuel channel simulator. A cool-
ant whose chemical composition and parameters were similar to real conditions was
punped through the channel. Ste-I was delivered to three chambers along the height
of the channel to simulate the steam content. It was delivered through a cermet
throttle valve so as to provide quiescent entry into the channel without a trans-
verse shock stream.

The channel was supplied with heat engineering monitoring devices and strain
gauges were installed on the three fuel element simulators in the upper TVS to
determine the characteristics of fuel element vibration. The inner surface of the
channel and the assembly was inspected prior to the beginning of the tests and the
dimensions of the assembly were measured. The water and steam flow rates were
varied during the tests according to the program and the readings of the strain
gauges and assembly vibration sensors were recorded. Thermal cycling by variation
of the water temperature at the inlet to the channel (800 cycles) was carried out
to test the channel for strength under variable operating conditions. The assem-
bly was tested for 10,000 hours at nominal flow rate and the assemblies were in-
spected every 500 hours. The vibrational frequencies and stresses in the fuel
elements were measured in 16 modes. Operating life tests confirmed the efficiency
of the assanbly.

The transportability of the assembly was checked simultaneously with tests of the
container designed for this purpose. One fully charged container was transported
by rail for a distance of more than 5,000 km. The assemblies and containers were
then inspected: they passed the test.

The final check of the efficiency of individual assemblies and of the design of
the fuel assembly as a whole was conducted during reactor tests. They were con-
ducted on several loop installations. The efficiency of full-size fuel elements
was confirmed: the strength of individual assmblies of the fuel assembly, the
hydrodynamic characteristics and their variation in time, the possibility of pro-
viding reliable heat removal during the entire service life and the behavior of
the TVS under variable operating conditions were finally checked. The water con-

ditions during the tests were close to the standard water regime adopted for the
RBMK reactor or to an amonia regime to check the possibility of the fuel elalents

operating in this mode. Several hundred shutdowns and startups with different
rate of power variation were conducted during the testing of the TVS.

The results of testing full-scale TVS confirm the data obtained during lass tests
of the fuel elements. The average fuel burnup exceeded the given value and con-
prised 19,200 moday/t. The behavior of the material of the fuel jackets also set
the requirements placed on it. The values of elongations of fuel elements of
given design, occurring during operation in the reactor, were refined. They coe-
priee no more than 0.20 percent of the initial length during the given run. In

of the assenblies. The hydrodynamic characteristics were measured repeatedly dur-
ing tests of full-scale assemblies, which confirmed the correctness of selecting
the calculating formulas to determine the hydraulic drag in the channel of the
M reactor. They also made it possible to study the growth dynamics of hydraulic
drag in tine due to deposits of corrosion products on the fuel elusnt surfaces.
This growth was insignificant.

The condition of the TVS and also of the pipes of the fuel channels was studied
carefully after testing, as a result of which it was established that the assen-
blies and parts of the new: fuel assemblies have the required efficiency. No dis-
ruptions of configuration. no wear of the fuel elenent jackets and no failures of

parts were found. The dangerom action of the assembly on the pipes of the fuel
channels were also not established.

The efficiency of the RBMX TVS was confirmed as a result of a couples of prereactor
and reactor tests. Oonducing an extensive check of the design, having principal
distinguishing features, made it possible to guarantee that the required charac-
teristics would be achieved during the given service life in plants with uranium-
graphite channel-type reactors.

[meerptsl 6.1.8. Regulation ot Energy mlease Distribution

The operator monitors the energy release distribution, the reserve coefficient to
maxim: permissible power (by the boiling crisis) and the naxim- permissible power
(by the linear load). the water flow rates through the channels and the general
loop heat engineering parameters such as pressure, tlow rates ot the circulation
and teed water, levels in the separators and so on, during operation ot the reactor
in the power range ot outputs.

Operational monitoring ot the energy release distribution is accomplished by sig-
nals of deviations tron the given settings of DIG currents , side ionization chen-
bers. intrareactor uz chambers and it the m is shut down, of the m chanber.

The settings tor these systems are calculated periodically by the Prime program

and are entered nanually into the systems on the operator's instructions.

Reactor power is monitored tree the readings ot auto-atic recorders that record
the total Dam current and ot the side ionization chanbers. The reactor power
produced by the SHEER“) is compared in the ispreasions ot the Scale system to
the results obtained tron readings of the heat engineering devices. Detailed in-
tornation nay be issued to the operator both in the torn ot cartograns and in the
torn ot abbreviated smaries with indication of regions with the least values at
ran tor detailed analysis of the reactor's condition. werational control of the
remaining heat engineering paraneters is aeintained tron signals onto a ainic

panel .

The operator's regulating actions during operation of the reactor are reduced
mainly to variation at the position of the $02 rods and regulation at the water
tlov rates through the channels and settings. It is regulated by an autonatic
regulator during runup ot power while the energy release distribution is regulated
manually. Reactor power can be neintained and the energy release distribution can

be stabilized by the MR systu after rung) to steady modes. At the same time the
operator continues to slowly correct the energy release distribution.

Manual regulation of the energy release distribution is accomplished by alternate
movement of the RR and SP rods and includes elimination of radial-azimuth and local
axial misaligments. Hisalignmsnts developed only by the first axial harmonic are
eliminated in the height distributions. The remaining harmonics are very stable
and their presence is taken into account during long-term variation of energy re-
lease distribution related to recharging of the TVS, DP and so on. In this case
the radial surge in the presence of a surge in the bottom half of the reactor is
eliminated by introducing a rod from below in the given region or by identical
introduction of RR and USP rods in the given reg.on in the upper and lower parts
of the reactor, respectively, or by introducing an or US? rods separately if their
ends are located near the center of the core in height, since their travel does
not create a height misalignment in this case.

Thus. analyzing the foregoing, it is easy to see that the complex of monitoring and
regulating system is essentially hierarchical structures. The monitoring structure
has independent subwstems in its base. The computer of the centralised Shale mon-
itoring system with the Priz'ma program, which calculates and carries out logical
analysis of all the incoming information, mutual tie-in of systems and issuance of
recommendations on adjustment of them, is located at the top of the munitoring
structure. The control structure also has practically independent subsystems in
its base. The reactor operator, who performs direct cmtrol functions and provides

correct interaction of the control subsystems along with performing more cwplex
functions (by the logic and amount of intonation to be processed), is located at
the top of the control structure.

The adopted structures provide reliable, efficient and safe operation of Raw:
reactors. Runup to nominal power was fLrst accomplish-ed in 1974, a fragment of
the computer printout of the channel parameters during these runups is presented
in Figure 6.8.

6.2. Reactor Power Control System

The methods and means of control outlined in section 6.1 reflect the problems of
regulating the energy release distribution through the core. Moreover this regula-
tion is required to achieve high power. A system in which ionization chambers lo-
cated in channels behind the reflector were used as detectors is provided to
monitor and control the total reactor power in all modes, i.e., from the subcriti-
cel state to the nominal state. This system also reduces the power or ooepletely
stops the chain reaction if situations occur that do not permit the process to
continue at a given level (urgency situations).

Schematic diagrams of control, logic elements and shaping signals for control of
actuating nechanisms and of control mechanisms themselves are included in the giv-

and system as components. The energy release field and the total power level are
regulated by absorbing rods that are a unified structure.

by signals which are shaped in the logic control circuit. The rods are

placer is presented in Figure 6.9 and represents sleeves of molded boron carbide
enclosed in airtight cavities. The rods are moved by servodrives installed di-

subcritical to no-inal power level. A block diagram of the power control is pre-

The neutron flux in starting nodes and at low power levels in monitored by three
independent measuring channels by INT-31 fission dual-hers located in the side re-
flector. The neutron flux density in logarithmic scale and the runup period of
the reactor are measured by the secondary electronic devices operating from the
fission chamber. After values that exceed the marina: permissible values have
beer. reached by the neutron flux for the fission chadsers, the latter are revved
from the core. The neutron flux is monitored at intermediate power levels by sig-
nals from the lent-$6 highly sensitive starting current ionization chambers located
in the tank of the side water shielding. The chamers are surrounded with lead
shields to reduce the effect of the v-background. The neutron flux density and
the runup period are determined by the signals of these chambers and the emergency
shielding of the reactor during the rung period is also triggered by these sig-
nals. The mic-56 starting ionization die-hers are used as sensors of the auto-
natic power control apparatus and also as shielding against an encess of power at
low levels.

rents of the ionization chanbers and acting on the four control rods moving syn-

There are eight protection channels against excess power in the system and the
protection is triggered if signals appear in two channels adjacent to the detectors
located around the reactor. If signals appear about impermissible rate of runup or
about an excess of established power. all the rods with the exception of the USP
rods are switched on for insertion into the core. Travel of the rods is stopped
upon the disappearance of the signals that caused their initial motion.

Continuous automatic monitoring of the functional state of the measuring apparatus,
including the neutron flux sensors, is provided. The fmctioning of the actuating
channels is also monitored by the value of desynchronization of their mutual posi-
tion. If a malfunctioning measuring or actuating channel is «htected, the mal-
functioning channel is switched off. On the whole. the regulator maintains effi-
ciency during failure of one measuring or one actuating channel.

6.4. Dynamic Processes

Development of powerful units of ABS leads to the need to design new generation
reactors distinguished by significant physical disensions, high specific energy
intensity and high rate of burnup. Quantitative changes of the indicated charac-
teristics inevitably lead to qualitative changes of the dynamic properties of the
reactors. The characteristic feature or these reactors is the instability of
energy release distribution in the core, which largely determines the operating
properties of ABS and the requirements on control systems. The Ram-1000 reactor
in which all the characteristics of the dynamics inherent to large reactors were
manifested, appeared in the Soviet Union as the first serially produced new gener-
ation reactor.

This required transition in the investigations of energy release dynamics from a
point nodal to a three-dimensional model. Transit deformations of the energy re-
lease field are determined by the codaination of neutron-physical and thermohy-
draulic processes in the core. The problem of investigating the stability of en-
ergy release can be reduced in linear approximation to analysis of the roots of
the characteristic equation found on the basis of joint solution of equations that
describe all the known processes in the core. An approach based on representation
of the solution in the form of a series by the eigen-functions of the boundary-
value problem (harmonics) is widespread in this case. This approach is more con-
venient for analytical estimates and provides a clear idea of the deformations
when separation of harmonics is possible.

95

At the same time the use of a digital computer permits one to considerably expand
the capabilities of this method during practical solution of problems of dynamics
and regulation in those cases when separation of harmonics is impossible. A com-
plex of programs was developed at the design stage for calculating the dynamic
characteristics of the energy release field and for determining the boundaries of
the zone of stability within different parameters. specifically, special nono-
grams were constructed by the complex program for rapid analysis of the dynamic
properties of radial-azimuth energy release by the known values of reactivity ef-
fects (Figure 6.17). These same nomograms give an idea of the main principles of
variation of the dynamic properties of energy release which must to taken into ac-
count both during design and during operation of reactors, since significant vari-
ations of the physical characteristics of the core occur from the mount of
initial charging to runup to the steady recharging mode.

The main results of analyzing the dynamic properties of the energy release field
within the core were found even during the period of designing the m and reduced
to the following:

the least stable radial-azimuth energy release distribution:

the pattern of deformation development is determined by the shape of the first
azimuth harmonic 901 with the automatic regulator switched on:

the typical times of deformation of the radial-azimuth field vary in a real
range of physical properties of the reactor from hours to tens of minutes. so-
called "rapid" instability with time constant on the order of tens of seconds is
possible with steam reactivity coefficient of (3° > 58 and the approach of on to

this limit should be regarded as impermissible:

energy release distribution through the height of the reactor close to the
boundary of instability. The process of transient distortion of the height field
developing has the form of fluctuations with a period of approximately 24 hours.

Experiments to determine the effects of reactivity and the characteristics of
transient deformations during operation of a reactor at power under normal operat-
ing conditions were begun parallel with calculation-theoretical investigations
during the period of energy startup of the first unit of the Leningrad ABS. The
method of experiments to determine the dynamic properties of the field is based on
the results of theoretical analysis outlined above [13].

The experiment consists of the fact that operations tomaintain the shape of the field
are temporarilystcpoed and the deformation developing during this is recorded with
the automatic regulator switched on. The deformation pattern observed in experi-
ment is characterized by development of energy release misalignment through half
the reactor, whose profile is determined by the first azimuth harmonic. The asi-
muth orientation of the misalignment is arbitrary (figure 6.18). The amplitude of
development of misalignment is measured in time by approximately the exponent
(Figure 6.19). The index of the degree of this exponent l/T01 is the generalized
quantitative measure of the field stability in the current state of the reactor.

In August 1974 the value of the rapid power effect of reactivity comprised 4

4-10‘ ﬁlm in the first unit of the uningrad has. The calculated value of the
time constant, corresponding to this reactivity effect, was 1'01 . 1 hour (Figure
6.20). ‘lhe tine constant deter-ined in experiment by the field dynamics comprised
1.04 hour. fluctuations of the axial energy release distribution were observed in
October-Decewer 1974 in the reactor of the first unit of the uningrad A35. The
characteristics of these fluctuations also corresponded to the calculated values.
It should be noted that fluctuations of the axial energy release occurred at s tine
when the axial field was stable, but the stability reserve was law. According to
estimates, the tine constant of attenuation of the fluctuations cowrised several
tens of hours. Under these conditions the changes of the local nultiplication
factor uncorrelated with the axial defonations related to stabilization of the
radial field caused stable fluctuations of energy release through the height of
the reactor. An algorithm for volt-attic control of the reactor was developed and
put into operation to eliminate this phemnanon.

Further scientific and methodical developments of the problems of analysing the
dynamics of energy release are directed toward determination and refinemmt of the
main principles of the effect of the steady form of the field, nonlinear factors,
the dependence of reactivity effects on coordinates. the effect of the control
process on field dynamics and development on this basis of more improved methods
and programs for calculating the dynamic characteristics of energy release within
the reactor.

Optimization of dynanic characteristics. Investigation of the dynamics of m
reactors and analysis of foreign data show that instability of energy release in
the core is an inherent property of large power reactors. However, this instabil-
ity is manifested differently depending on the specific physical, thermodynuic
and geometric characteristics of the reactor. The shape and time of development
of deformations may vary over a wide range (from tens of seconds to tens of hours)
as a function of these characteristics. It is obvious that the simpler the form
of deformation and the longer the time of development. the simpler organisation of
control is.

The experience of operating the Leningrad ass shoved that the instability of asi-
muth distribution with time constant of more than 30 minutes essentially has no
effect on reactor control and is not even perceived by the operating personnel as
an instability. Moreover, special experiments were required to prove the insta-
bility. At the same time deformations of the height field with period of 25-30
hours had an appreciable effect on motor control and required development of
special control algorithms. This circumtance is related to the fact that the
appearance of axial deformations leads to the need to consider the reactor as a
three-dimensional control object and to develop three-dimensional control algo-
rithms. There fore, one of the most important problems of reactor development is
optimization of the parameters and structure of the core such that its dynamic
properties are most favorable for organization of control or at least significant
‘couplications do not develop.

The available practical experience of purposeful practical improvement of the dy-
namics of reactors of the first unit of the Isningrad ass confined the effective-
ness of this approach. The following setth of active interference in the dynam-
ics of a reactor can now be formulated on the basis of analysing the dependence of
dyanmic energy release properties on the physical and thermothydraulic
characteristics:

variation of the 0-235 nuclei and graphite ratio in the core due to variation
of fuel enrichment. an increase of fuel charge, variation of lattice spacing. the
use of graphite with lower effective density and so on:

formation of a specific energy release profile that provides high stability
of the reactor;

an increase of the mean effective steam content and temperature of the fuel
elements and a decrease of the aean effective graphite temperature in the core.

The possibility of improving the operational properties of reactors by purposeful
variation of their dynamic properties was used extensively when working out nea-
sures to increase the stability of Ram-1000 reactors and during design of M-
1500 and Ram-2400 reactors. As a result the decision to convert to fuel with
two-percent enrichment was adopted for all Ram-1000 reactors. This enrichment
was also adopted for Rum-1500 and mow-2400 reactors.

Characteristics of the effect of the external circuit on reactor operation. The
behavior of the production parameters of the ertemal loop, which is dependent both
on the output parameters of the reactor and on operation of the main equipmnt
(turbogenerators. deaerators. separator drum. feed assemblies, G'rsN and so on) and
their control systems, has a significant effect on reactor operation along w..th
the internal processes. Such parameters of the external loop as the pressure and
level in the separator drum, delivery water flow rate and flow rate through the
We loop act on the reactor by external feedback. It is characterised by its own
transfer coefficients and phase distortions which depend to a significant degree

on the quality of operation of the automatic thermal systems that switch on the
level and pressure regulators of the separator drum. The task of these automatic
systems is to bring the reactor and turbogenerator power, the steam flow rate to
the turbine with delivery of feed water into agreement and also to provide normal
steam separation conditions in the separator drum.

The dependence of the parameters of the external loop on the operation of its
equipment (turbogenerator, Grail, feed pups and so on) determines the nature of
the effect of this equipment on reactor operation, which must be taken into ac-
count when organizing the reactor control system and the mode management algorithms
during normal operation and in emergency situations.

Problems related to design of external systems are primarily related in provision
of the required operating properties of the reactor wit to selection of the re-
quired characteristics of the equipment and optimization of the automatic thermal
systems. Thus, based on the dynamics of the transient and emergency modes, re-
quirements on the inertial characteristics of the ms" were determined that provide
reactor safety when supplying its own needs. Investigations of the automatic
thermal systems showed that its optimization may significantly improve the quality
of the transient processes in the reactor unit by the integral power of the reactor.
the pressure and level in the separator drm and may increase the safety and reli-
ability of its operation in transient modes [14].

The essential feature of the external loop is the presence of two circulation
loops, each of which has its own production equipment with the corresponding con-
trols systems. a two-loop layout of the circulating loop is in itself a potential
source of asymmetrical disturbances of the reactor that stimulate the occurrence
of transient azimuth deformations. Therefore, both the space-time behavior of
energy release and operation of both loops of the external circuit with its control
systems must be simulated during investigations of the dynamic processes in the
reactor. This situation is based not only on theroretical investigations but also
on the data of the operating experience of ABS with seam-1000 type reactors.

The role of experimental investigations. A required step of investigations is an
experimental check of theoretical propositions which is the basis and stimulus for
further development of theory. Data obtained on operating reactors have the great-
est value in this case since it is essentially impossible to reproduce real inter-
related processes in their combination mder beach conditions. Therefore, exten-
sive complex investigations of the dynamics whose task was to confirm the main
design solutions and to refine. the relationships, principles and characteristics
of the processes, were developed from the first days of startup of the pilot unit
of the Leningra" hrs. The main task in organizing the investigations was to de-
velop methods of conducting and processing the results of experiments which would
yield preliminary results with minimal changes of the operating mode of the reac-
tor and ABS and observation of all the standards and safety regulations. The
significance of eXperimental investigations is not limited only to a check of the
theoretical propositions and confirmation of the design solutions. As indicated
by the experience of operating ABS, the experimntal methods developed and conven-
ient to operate become an essentially standard means of monitoring the dynamic
properties of a reactor [15). The need for this monitoring is determined by the
fact that there is considerable evolution of their physical and dynamic

characteristics during reactor operation, related to variation of the isotope
composition of the fuel and to the different measures to modernize the charge and
components of the core.

Very promising in organization of systematic monitoring of reactor characteristics
are statistical methods of investigations, despite the difficulty of introducing
them mainly by engineering concepts. These difficulties include the need to re-
cord the fluctuations of the production parameters with high resolution and auto-
matic processing of large files of accuulated information. The experience of us-
ing statistical methods to diagnose the dynamic state of the newt-1000 reactor [15]
shows the effectiveness and possibility of practical use of these methods under
industrial operating conditions based on standard monitoring-measuring equipment
at the plant. It should be noted that statistical methods may be useful to solve
a nmber of problems of reactor diagnostics and equipment operation of ABS and may
also be a convenient means of special investigations in existing reactors.

Data on the behavior of parameters during random emergency modes are very valuable
to deepen the concepts of the principles of processes and to refine the character-
istics and also to obtain information about real disruptions in the operation of
equipment. The main problem in this case is to organize monitoring and recording
of all main parameters upon the occurrence of an emergency with the required reso-
lution both in time and amplitude. The indicated problems can be solved by using
special measuring couplexes that include digital computers.

It is obvious that planned investigations should be conducted in all operating ro-
actors by unified standard methods (for comparability of results). The methods
should be developed and improved in coordinated order in this case.

10.1. Configuration and Design

he most important requirement placed on the m reactor is the need for it to
operate with mini-us: shutdowns. Therefore, fuel recharging and elimination of sons
emergency situations in an operating reactors is provided without reducing its
power. This can be carried out only by a special machine that perforls the follow-

ing operations:
recharging the TVS in an operating and cooled reactor:

checking the passage of the fuel channel in caliber that sisulates a standard
assembly:

sealing of the fuel channel with a plug (production or emergency):
mechanized elimination of some emergency situations.

Fuel recharging in an operating reactor should be carried out at operating para-
eters of the fuel channels.

'ihe loading-unloading machine (R214) should perform five operations on recharging
the fuel channels in an operating reactor during 24 hours without reducing its
power and no fewer than 10 operations of channel recharging on a shutdown reactor.

The working principle of the m in an operating reactor includes the following.
An RZM filled with condesnate at taperature of so'c is joined to the channel to
be recharged. Pressure equal to the pressure in the fuel channel is established
in the pressure vehicle and the channel is unsealed. Condensate is pumped into
the channel from the pressure vehicle at flow rate to to l n3/hr. The cold con-
densate prevents penetration of steam and hot water from the fuel channel to the
824. After the spent fuel assembly has been removed. the channel is sealed and

the pressure in the pressure vehicle is dropped to atmospheric pressure. The ma-
chine is disconnected from the channel and is sent to the point where the spent
assemblies are unloaded.

The main parts of the 82" are a crane, container, two replaceable pressure vehicles
(one installed on the machine and the other in the repair zone), truss, production
equipment, guidance system and control where. An overall view of the R24 is

sists of a gantry 18 with span of 21 meters and a carriage 19 which moves slang
the gantry. The crane gantry is moved to a distance of 39.6 meters and the car-
riage by a distance of 12.5 meters sleng the crane tracks ll meters from the floor
of the central room. The gantry and carriage have two travel speeds each: 9.75

the gantry is 105.8 tons and that of the carriage is 56.3 tons. A massive steel
ring is welded to the carriage and a container l7,which is the biological shield-
ing together with the ring, is attached to its lower end.

of 500 mm. It consists of six sections with total mass of 200 tons. There is
movable biological shielding 13 in the bottom section of the container that closes
the gap between the bottom of the container and the floor of the central room at
the mommt of recharging. A cab and platforms with ladders are attached to the
outside of the container. The ”active" lower half of the pressure vehicle is lo-
cated inside the container. A truss 6 with four platforms where the production
equipment 2 is located, electrical equipment and monitoring and measuring devices
are located is installed on the RZH crane carriage. There are term buckles on the
truss--tightening devices by which the pressure vehicle is held in the vertical
position. The production equipment is designed to supply the m systems with
circulation water, turbine condensate and air of the required parameters. Its
main parts are fed pumps, bellows type cocks, valves, containers and compressed
air tanks. The water pressure, flow rates and levels are measured by means of
monitoring and measuring devices.

We systems for precise aiming of the 82!! toward the fuel channel--an optical-
television systaa 12 (main) and contact system (reserve) 18 for loss of visibility
in a steaming fuel channel are installed in the lower part of the container. The

cle by small movements of the gentry and carriage. The contact system for guiding
the RZM is a pnemtoelectromechanical device designed to guide the m toward the

face of the fuel channel head. The m is controlled from the operator room. which
is located behind the end wall of the central room on the side of the reactor.
Moreover, a control console for moving the crane is installed in the 8214 cab.

The most crucial structure of the 32b! is the pressure vehicle, which is a high-

pressure vessel inside which are located the actuating neclunisms that perform
the following functions:

Figure 10.2. Grab with Equalizing mechanism

All the main parts of the pressure vehicle (upper 3, middle 9. lower 14 and shut-

off device 10) are joined to each other by flange joints and sealing gaskets. The
upper part of the pressure vehicle includes all the enchanisns related to hoisting

and lowering of the suspension and assembly: drive for novemnt and control of the
grab 4. The assembly is raised and lowered by the grab, moved and controlled by
means of two chains 3. The grab is served during joint notion of the chains and is
controlled (opened or closed) upon counter notion. Only the grab, chains and guide
sprockets are located in the high-pressure sons, while all the drives are located
outside the pressure vehicle housing. The rotating shafts are sealed by asbestos-

fabric cuffs of the herringbone type.

The grab (Figure 10.2) is made in the for: of a precast cylindrical housing 1 in
which are installed two gear racks 3 and S that interact with pinions 4 located

on the shaft of the grab drive mechanism 2. The grab is rigidly connected to the
chains by the upper ends of the racks. This version provides uniform load distri-

bution on both chains during hoisting and lowering of the suspension and assenbly.
A can 6 that acts on the jaws of the grab 7 is attached to the lower end or one of

the racks. The configuration and arrangement of one of the can profile are selec-
ted so as to provide separation or closing of the grab jaws during counteraction

of the racks.

me chains are made of channel-type links with bushings and rollers in the joints.
Both chains always operate together and their working sections are arranged in a
guide pipe while their free sections are located in the chain receptacles. The
middle part of the pressure vehicle (see Figure 10.1) is designed for location of
fresh and spent assemblies, gauge and plugs. The middle part includes a housing,
cartridge 1, chain winding mechanism 7 and cartridge rotation drive 8. The hous-
ing of the middle part of the pressure vehicle is structurally made in the form of
a vessel (a pipe 600 mm in diameter) which consists of three sections with total
length of 16.5 meters. There is a cartridge support with chain winding mechanise
and cartridge rotation mechanism in the upper section of the housing.

The pressure vehicle cartridge (a pipe 449 mm in diameter) consists of three sec-
tions with total length of 16.5 meters each. Pour containers of pipe 140 mm in
diameter over the entire length of the cartridge are installed in each section of
it. A fresh assembly, gauge and emergency plug are located in the containers.
One container is left free to place the assembly removed from the reactor in it.

The shutoff device is designed to open and close the working zone of the pressure
vehicle, to cut off the working cavity of the pressure vehicle from that of the
fuel channel, for emergency closing of the fuel channel cavity when performing
emergency work in the pressure vehicle and to ensure biological shielding of the
cavity of the lower part of the pressure vehicle when the assembly is raised into
the cartridge. It is two slide valves with parallel disks joined in series in one
massive housing which also perforss the role of biological shielding. The electro-
mechanical drives of the slide valves are removed together with the bellows type
seal beyond the wall of the container through stepped openings in the doors of the
third section. The lower part of the pressure vehicle is designed for airtight
remote connection of the pressure vehicle cavity to the fuel channel and also for
sealing and unsealing the fuel channel. A joining connecting pipe with mechanism
for moving it 16 and loops are located in the lower part.

The joining connecting pipe is designed to perform the main function of the lower
part of the pressure vehicle--it is joined to the head of the channel, sealed by
means of rubber inflation cuffs and acts on the shutoff device of the channel with
a special hook 15 (see Figure 10.1). i.e.. it seals or unseals it. The mechanism
for moving the joining connection pipe moves it vertically by means of two ball-
screw reduction gears and two conical and e distributing reduction gear. Sensors
that provide remote operation of the mechanism. sensors for limiting the free fall
of the joining connecting pipe and for canpensating for the thermal fluctuations
of the fuel channel and the upper position of the joining connecting pipe are at-
tached to the ball-screw reduction gears.

The loops are designed to deliver turbine condensate. air and electric power to
the movable part of the joining connection pipe. The hydraulic loop provides
filling of the joining connecting pipe with the turbine condensate, sealing of the
rubber inflatable cuffs and removal of leaks from the inflatable rubber cuffs to
the pressure sensor. Air is fed through the pneumatic loop to the sensor of the
lower position of the grab and connection pipe. Electric power is fed by means of
the electric loop to the level meter, sensors of the lower position of the connec-
tion pipe and grab and also to the thermocouple. A simplified kinematic diagram
of the drives that recharge and unseal the m is presented in Figure 10.3.

II‘he following machine service zones are provided in the central room.

1. The parking place is a zone in the central room designed for parking the ma-
chine during periods between reactor recharges.

2. A simulator bench designed for:
adjustment and checking of the mechanisms of the machine;
filling the pressure vehicle with condensate:
simulation of standard recharging;
loading a fresh assembly into the pressure vehicle:
decontamination of the inner cavity of the pressure vehicle:
replacement of the inflatable cuffs of the joining connection pipe.

The simulator bench has the corresponding equipment to perform these operations.

3. An assembly for receiving the spent assemblies is used to receive the gauge.

4. The repair zone is designed to replace a pressure vehicle that has failed. It
is located in the central room in the region of the simulator bench. A fully as-
sembled reserve pressure vehicle is permanently located in the zone.

10.2. Operating Modes

Preparation of the 3211 for operation. The machine is put into operation in the
following manner. The simulator bench is prepared: the plugs are removed from
the seat (seats I and II of the simulator bench) to fill the pressure vehicle with
condensate. The gauge and production plug are installed in these seats. me
electropneumstic power supply of the machine mechanisms is switched on and it is
fed from the parking place to the simulator bench to seat 1.

After power has been supplied to the RZM, the valve for filling the feeder tank
with condensate from the loop is opens! automatically. The machine is joined to
seat I on the simulator bench and the gauge is tightened into the dry machine and
the machine is then joined to seat 11 and the production plug is removed from it.
The pressure vehicle of the R214 is then filled with condensate in seat I]: until
the level in the filling tank of the joining connection pipe appears. After the
pressure vehicle has been filled with condensate, the sealed slide valves are
opened, the condensate is dumped from the seat and the joining connection pipe to
the pipi: g in the machine is separated from the seat.

Standard recharging. The following procedure is observed when the machine is op-
erating in the standard recharging node. The 8214 with pressure vehicle filled
with condensate (t a 30°C) is directed toward seat I or II of the simulator bench

in which fresh fuel assemblies are first installed. The joining connection pipe
is joined and sealed with the head of the seat. The seat and joining connection

pipe are then filled with condensate from the seat filling system. The slide
valves are then opened after this operation, a fresh TVS is screwed into the car-
tridge of the pressure vehicle and is installed in it. The protective slide valves
are closed and the condensate from the joining connection pipe in the seat are
dumped into the sewer.

The machine is disconnected from the seat and is sent to the reactor to recharge
the fuel channel.

Recharging of the fuel assembly. The operator instructs that a specific fuel chan-
nel be prepared for recharging according to the program for recharging the reactor.
The protective plug is removed from the channel and the cable of the y-detector is
disconnected from the assembly plug. These Operations are performed manually by
workers of the central room. The 3231 automatically emerges to the coordinate of
the channel to be recharged, is joined and the plug of the machine is then sealed
to the head of the channel by high pressure. The joining connection pipe is then
filled with condensate from the tank, the slide valves are opened, the feed pump
is switched on and a pressure of 73-75 kgf/cm2 is created in the pressure vehicle.
The grab is lowered and linked to the head of the asseubly. The sealing and un-
sealing mechanism is switched on and the channel is unsealed.

When the process of unsealing is completed, the hoisting mechanism is switched off
and the spent assembly is raised to a height of 7.5 meters to the cooling zone
where it is held for 10 minutes. The cold condensate (t I 30'C) begins to be fed
into the fuel channel at the moment it is unsealed from the machine (the pup op-
erates to feed condensate constantly to the pressure vehicle until a fresh assewly
has been installed in the channel and it has been sealed) at a flow rate up to
0.5-1.0 m3/hr. After the asscnbly has been held in the cooling zone, the hoisting
mechanism is switched off, the assembly is inserted into the pressure vehicle and
is installed in the cartridge. The passage of the channel is checked by the gauge
and a fresh assembly is then installed in the reactor. The pup feeding the con-
densate to the pressure vehicle is switched off after the channel has been sealed
and the pressure in the pressure vehicle is dropped to amospheric pressure. The
sealing slide valves are closed, the cavity of the connection pipe is joined to a
special blower and the airtightness of the channel head is checked. The condensate
is removed by compressed air delivered to the upper part of the joining connection
pipe, which forces the condensate into the tank, prior to disconnecting the connec-
tion pipe with the channel from the cavity of the joining connection pipe.

The RZM is then unsealed and disconnected from the fuel channel and the machine is
sent to the assembly for reception of spent assemblies. The receiving assembly is
prepared for unloading the spent assembly from the m pressure vehicle into the
jacket of the holding tank, which is installed in one of the seats of the receiw
ing assembly, even during operation of the m on the reactor. The jacket is
filled with condensate. The machine with the spent assembly in the pressure ve-
hicle automatically emerges to the coordinate of the prepared jacket. The machine
is joined and sealed to the jacket of the holding tank. The cavity of the joining
connecting pipe is filled with condensate from the tank, the slide valves are
opened and the spent TVS is removed from the pressure vehicle to the jacket. The
slide valves are then closed, the condensate is expelled into the tank from the
connection pipe by compressed air and the machine is disconnected from the jacket
and is ready for a new recharging cycle.

Recharging a shut-down and cooled reactor. A shut-down and cooled reactor can be
recharged by two versions:

1) unloading two spent assenblies with installation of fresh assemblies to
replace them:

2) unloading two spent assemblies and fresh assemblies are installed in the
reactor without using the RZH by means of devices and transport equipment pro-
vided in the central room.

In both versions the production operations of the 1!er are simplified in nature
since the excess pressure in the reactor is maintained at 2-5 kgf/cm2 (approxi-
mately 0.2-0.5 me) or is absent and the condensate is drained to the level of

the assembly heads. If there is pressure in the reactor, the m is continuously
filled with condensate and it is not delivered to the pressure vehicle by the R2“
systems. If there is no pressure in the reactor. condensate must be fed to the
pressure vehicle constantly when unloading the spent assemblies. The production
plug is first removed from the cartridge of the pressure vehicle when unloading two
spent assemblies and the gauge is also removed when unloading four assemblies. The
time of the recharging cycle for two assedalies is 350 minutes and consequently the
RZM is capable of recharging eight fuel channels per day. A total of 267 ainutes
is expended to unload four esseshlies, i.e., the m is capable of unloading 20
fuel channels per day.

11.1. Principles for Improving the Core

Channel-type uranium-graphite power reactors will be improved in their subsequent
development in engineering and econonic characteristics. These improvements will
be made as further design and planning developnents are made, experimental inves-
tigations are conducted and experience in operating reactors at existing ABS is
accmulated. As a result capital expenditures per unit of establist power of an
as, the cost of generated energy, the nmber of Operating personnel, specific con-
struction volumes and consumption of natal, including stainless steel, the labori-
ousnese and periods of construction and installation work should be reduced and
the operating reliability and maneuverability of the energy units with these reac-
tors should be increased. All this can be achieved by increasing the intensity of
the core and the extent of nuclear fuel burnup, conversion to the block principle
of constructing a reactor, introduction of nuclear superheating of steam with an
increase of its initial parameters and with simultaneous improvement of the thereal
layout of the unit, improvement of the configuration of the energy block and other
improvements in the designs of the basic equipment and of schematic and configura-
tion decisions.

One must also bear in mind in this case the tendency toward an increase of the
unit output of units caused by the constant increase of the requirement of the
total introduced power of ABS. Sane promising solutions to improve uranium-
graphite power reactors and energy units with these reactors are considered below.

An increase of the unit power is one of the possible methods of improving the
economy of ABS. This path was reflected in development of Roux-1500, near-2000
and usurp-2400 (1-4] with electrical output of 1,500, 2,000 and 2,400 m, respec-
tively, with respect to M reactors. The output of the fuel channel has been
increased l.S-fold in the Ram-1500 reactor compared to the ”MK-1000 reactor due
to intensification of the heat transfer, which makes it possible to increase the
power of the Bank-1000 to 1,5000 m while maintaining the overall dimensions and

design of the reactor. The channel diameter, number of fuel elements in the as-
sembly and lattice spacing have been increased in the smut-2000 reactor. This
makes it possible to develop a reactor with double output in the dimensions of
the RBHK-lOOO.

Development of a channel with increased output with respect to R8"! reactors opens
new opportunities toward improving their engineering and economic characteristics.
The experience of operating ABS with anus-1000 reactors showed that there is some
reserve both with respect to the linear loads on the fuel elements and with respect
to the maximum channel output (with respect to conditions of heat transfer crisis).
0n the other hand, it turned out that the stability of energy release distribution
decreases as fuel is burned up and as additional absorbers that compensate for the
initial excess reactivity are removed from the reactor.

As indicated by calculations and confirmed by experiments, the main factor that
determines the deformation of the energy release fields with time constant of the
first azimuth harmonic from several to tens of minutes is a positive steam reac-
tivity coefficient u¢. A decrease of its value improves the stability of energy
release distribution. An increase of the nuclear fuel to moderator nuclei ratio
can be regarded as the most economical and optimum method of reducing the steam
coefficient: an increase of enrichment is most economical and optimum for operating
reactors. The main characteristics of a reactor with an increase of fuel enrich-
ment for steady continuous recharging mode are presented in Table 11.1.

Conversion to increased fuel enrichment leads to an increase of the extent of burn-
up, variation of coefficient do that improves field stability and to a reduction of
nuclear fuel and fuel element consumption. 0n the other hand, an increase of en-
richment and a corresponding increase of the extent of fuel burnup leads to an in-
crease of output of a freshly charged channel, to an increase of the lifetime of
the fuel in the reactor and to an increase of linear loads on the fuel element
(Table 11.2). The possibility of increasing channel output (up to l.S-fold) has
been confirmed by development and creation of the fuel channel for the naureisoo
reactor.

Turning to discussion of the results, it should be noted that the given data
should be regarded mainly as comparative rather than as absolute data since the
calculations were made for a steady fuel recharging mode. Coefficients of nonun-
iformity x, and K1, found with regard to the experience of operating sear-1000
reactors, and the calculated recharging coefficients were used when determining
the output of freshly charged channels. Kg - 1.4 was adopted for reactors operat-
ing on fuel with enrichment of 1.8 percent and the coefficient of nonuniformity
by height was x: - 1.4. Based on the experience of operating near-1000 reactors,
the mean square error of determination and maintenance of channel output on was
assumed equal to 5.2 percent while that of the linear load on that of the fuel
element was at - 7.7 percent.

The data indicate that an increase of fuel enrichment in sear-1000 reactors is a
realistic method of increasing the effectiveness of fuel utilization. The use of

enrichment up to 3.6 percent is possible according to the permissible outputs of
channels and linear loads on the fuel element. The problem of increasing channel
output and the linear loads on the fuel element up to 1.5-fold has been resolved

transfer intensifiers; the channel design and the delivery and drain pipelines are
not changed. ‘l'vs without intensifiers can be used with more moderate increase of
fuel enrichnent in the Rum-1000. For example, conversion to 2 percent fuel en-
richment can be accomplished without any design changes in the TVS.

We also note that the maxim values of output presented in Table 11.2 were ob-
tained on the asemption that the algorithm for equalization of output through the
core remains the same as in existing arm-loco reactors. At the same time one can
suggest a ntsnber of measures, part of which has already been tested experimentally
in reactors. that make it possible to expand the capability of equalizing the en-
ergy distribution in the core. These measures may include the use of absorbing
rods inserted into fresh TVS and removed as channel output decreases, the use of
burnup absorbers. optimization of recharging procedures and so on. A specific

An increase of enricluaent leads to a decrease of fuel element and natural uranium
consumption. The annual consumption of fuel elements upon conversion from version
to version decreases by 20-30 percent and if three percent enrichment is used, it
decreases by one-half; the 0-235 content in the unleaded fuel is reduced to 0.25
percent, i.e., to the spent tailings of enrichment plants. and if enrichment of
3.6 percent is used, it is reduced to 0.2 percent, which resolves the question of
the feasibility of extracting the 0-235 from the spent fuel. An increase of in-
itial enricMent significantly changes the steam coefficient of reactivity, re-
ducing it compared to enrichment of 1.8 percent and even shifting it in the nega-
tive direction, which proves the stability of energy release distribution. but
requires special consideration of the transient modes.

core to 10-12 years when using enrichment of 3-3.6 percent accordingly requires
special investigations and confireation. The prognosis for development of fuel
elements with oxide fuel burnup of 45-50 GWoday/t of uranium may be assured real-
istic on the example of fuel eluents for was reactors [7. B]. A more difficult
problem is to provide viability and integrity of the fuel elements for prolonged
periods under reactor conditions.

‘lhe possibility of increasing channel output 1.5-fcld opens up new prospects for
Ram-1000 reactors and ensures a significant improvement of the economic indicat-
ors of the fuel cycle due to an increase of fuel enrichment. When fuel with en-
richment of 2.4-3.0 percent is used in newt-1000 reactors. development and
experimental confirmation of the efficiency of fuel elements that permit extent

indicate their promise.

11.2. Sectional-Block Design of a Motor

The channel-type reactor as a whole and its individual assemblies are now mainly
assembled at the construction site. The components oi the reactor in the torn of
parts or small assmbly units are delivered from different plants to the installa-
tion site, where they are asseabled into a single structure. A large number of
spot assasbly-welding operations with the necessary monitoring is carried out un-
der installation conditions in this case. It is understandable that the installa-
tion conditions are less adaptable for these types of operations than conditions
in specialized shops. Therefore, conversion of a large fraction of assesbly and
welding Operations from the installation site to plant conditions would make it
possible to incense the quality of reactor manufacture and to improve control and
increase its operating reliability. Moreover, thisde decision will provie a consid-
erable reduction of the periods of installation work in construction of ABS and
consequently of the total construction period. All this yields a large saving.

An overall view of the reactor is presented in Figure 11.1. Each section is as-
sembled from lower, upper and side blocks. Making the core and consequently the
reactor in the shape of a rectangle with constant width per-its one to increase

the reactor power to the required value by increasing its length by installing a
large number of standardized sections. (There is a limit in power in a cylindri-
cal reactor, determined by the maximun possible diameter of the upper plate). In
this case development of a new design or the main blocks and rearrangement of the
machine-building base are not required to convert to new. increased power. The

central sections are designed for arrangement of the fuel and special channels and
the side reflector in them, while the two end sections of the reactor are used to
locate the end reflector in them.

The lower and upper blocks (Figures 11.2 and 11.3) are hollow sealed boxes in the
form of parallelepipeds with internal longitudinal and transverse ribs to provide
stiffness to the structure, welded from sheet steel. ‘ihe blocks are transported
in assembled form from the manufacturing plant to the ABS construction site on
special rail transporters (Figure 11.4). Transport by water, air or on truck-
trains is also possible.

'Ihe sectional-block design of a uranium-graphite reactor permits an increase in
the quality of manufacture and at the same tine an increase of operating reliabil-
ity and also considerably reduces the period of ABS construction as a result of
conversion of a large part of operations in manufacture of the reactor from the
assembly site to specialized plant conditions. All this yields a large saving.

11.3. Steam Superheating in the Core

The turbines at most nodern ABS operate on saturated steam at pressure of 60-70
kgf/cm2 (approximately 6-7 “9a) in front of the check valve. These camaratively
low steam parameters are explained by the poor efficiency of existing zirconium
alloys used as the material of the fuel jackets at elevated temperatures and also
of the fuel channel pipes in channel-type m reactors. At the same time the
efficiency of the A35 is increased, capital expenditures for construction are re-
duced and the reliability and maneuverability of the turbounits are increased
vith steam superheeting in the core. Thermal discharges into the environment are
reduced and the flow rate of the cooling water through the turbine condensers is
reduced with an increase of efficiency.

If steam superheating to 450°C at presure of 6S kgf/clu2 (approximately 6.5 MPa) is
provided, then the thermal output of a reactor with superheating will be 11-12
percent less compared to an energy unit with saturated steam of the sane pressure
and same electrical output. This is a considerable advantage that leads to an
appreciable reduction of the nuclear fuel consumption. The specific steam consmp-
tion at the indicated superheating parameters are less by approximately a factor

of 1.4 than saturated steam consumption of the sale pressure. The turbounit is

121

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

improved, its reliability is increased and the operating conditions of the steam-
inlet and steam-outlet mmbers of turbines are improved due to use of superheated
steam and a reduction of its consumption. A reduction of steam consumption also
results in a decrease of the number of main circulating pumps and separators in
the reactor unit.

All these advantages yield a considerable saving. However, an increase of coolant
parameters with introduction or nuclear superheating requires the use of materials
efficient at elevated temperatures in the core.

Water-graphite reactors of the Beloyarskaya A25 in which steam is superheated in
the core to 510°C at pressure of 90 kgf/cn2 (approximately 9 MPa) have been Oper-
ating tor a long time in the Soviet Union [10). Since the coolant temperature in
the superheated channels is considerably higher than that in the evaporation chan-
nels. the superheated fuel elmnt jackets should now be made of steel. A zircon-
iun alloy should be used in the structure of superheated channels, as well as in
the evaporation channels, to manufacture the channel pipe. The fuel jackets must
first be pads of steel since their teuperature exceeds 600°C. This naturally re-
duces sonemat the neutron balance in the superheated part of the core.

However, the advantage is conparatively low and the total saving achieved from
steam superheating remains signiﬁcant when steel is used only for the fuel jackets.

The superheated channel (rigure 11.5) is similar in design to the evaporator chan-
nel and is a welded tubular structure 18-20 meters long. he channel is made of
zirconium pipe with outer diameter of 88 an and wall thickness or 4 mm within the
core. The zirconium pipe is joined at the top and bottom to pipes of corrosion-
resistant steel by means of steel-zirconium: adapters.

The characteristic feature of a superheated assembly design is the presence of a
housing. There is a slit 1-2 mm wide between the outer surface of the housing and
the inner surface of the channel pipe. As a result part of the saturated steam en-
tering the channel from below is passed through the slit to cool the zirconium pipe
of the channel. The temperature dependence of the steam and superheated channel
components on the thermal resistance of the housing for thermal output channels of
2,400 kit with saturated steam temperature of 290'c at the inlet and superheated
steam temperature of 470°C at the channel output are shown in Figure 11.6. The
results were obtained at steam flow rate through the slit, comprising 25 percent
of the total flow rate through the channel equal to 14.5 t/hr.

11.4. The Coolant Loop and Equipment Configuration

The sectional principle of reactor core configuration is feasible and can also be
used in the design of the entire reactor unit. with this principle the coolant
circuit is separated into several loops identical in output and composition and
equipment configuration. There are evaporation and superheated loops in a reactor
with superheated steam in the core. The evaporation loop is a circuit of multiple

forced circulation, while the superheated loop is an open superheated steam cir-
cuit. The equipment of each loop is arranged in individual boxes insulated from

adjacent bores by protective walls. which permits repair operations in them with-
out complete shutdown of the reactor.

The nultiloop principle of designing a reactor unit provides great advar tagee.
The entire unit seemingly consists of several relatively independent units. Be-
cause of this it has high flexibility. The individual loops or several loops can

124

operate at lower power compared to the remaining loops or can be switched off
completely. his capability permits repair operations on the loop with the reac-
tor operating at reduced power both during planned repairs and during repairs
caused by disruptions in operation of a given loop. The entire reactor must be
shut down in reactor units having no division into individual loops located in
protective boxes to carry out any repair work. Therefore. the repairability of a
sectional unit is higher than that of a noneectional unit.

Division of the unit into individual loops sharply increases its safety. The out-
put of each loop is relatively low. The diameters of all the pipelines and the
dimensions of equipment are also considerably less than that without separation
into loops. Therefore, the consequences of an emergency will be considerably lower
if the seal of the circuit is broken due to ruptures of pipelines or equipment
failures. Thus. the measures required to ensure the safety of the mvironmsnt and
population and also of plant personnel are easier to fulfill and require lower
expenditures.

The sectional-block design of a reactor and the multiloop version of the coolant
circuit permit easy variation of output of the power unit by selecting the re-
quired nunber of standardized reactor sections and loops of the coolant circuit.
Additional research work is not required and new equipment does not have to be
produced in this case, which yields a large saving.

It is known that the unit output of power units will increase constantly. This
trend will also be maintained in the future. The problem of increasing the unit
outputs is solved comparatively simply with a sectional-block design. 'lhe safety
