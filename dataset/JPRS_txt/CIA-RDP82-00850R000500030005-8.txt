JAPANESE TECHNOLOGICAL AID FOR SRV BICYCLE INDUSTRY
Tokyo NIKON KEIZAI SHIHBUN in Japanese 17 Dec 81 p 8 -

[Text] Shinys Industry on the 16th clarified the policy of giving Vietnam tech-
nological aid concerning the manufacture of bicycles. This was recently agreed
upon between the said company and "Autocycle-Bicycls United Enterprise" in Ho
Chi Hinh City (formerly Saigon City). In the future. technicians will be dis-
patched from Japan at the request of the Vietnamese side and they will give
technological guidance on the manufacture of bicycles as s vhole.

Shinya Industry is exporting bicycle rims to Vietnam, and because of this actual
record, the Vietnamese side requested aid in the technological field. This is
to be noted as a unique example of exchange on an enterprise basis, which

exchange has generally been suspended since the unification of North and South
Vietnam.

Shinya Industry and ”Autocycle-Bicycle United Enterprise” have agreed on guidance
in the technological field ranging over the manufacture and assembly of bicycles,
from the manufacture of pipe for bicycles to painting and assembly of bodies.

It is said to include also concrete knovhov for the building of plants, including
the improvement of various production lines and rationalization. Also, machines

to inspect the quality of finished pipe and those for the production of various
parts for bodies are scheduled to be supplied by Shinya Industry.

Therefore, the said company will dispatch technicians to Vietnam, from time to
time. In addition. it intends to invite technicians in charge from Vietnam to
Japan to help them acquire techniques through the inspection of plants.

In Vietnam. demand for bicycles is active as a means of transportation among the
people. At present. a plan is under way for greatly expanding the output capacity
for bicycles. to meet such demand.
