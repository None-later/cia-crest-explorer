lfex£7 Introduction. Many studies showing the harmful effect of SHF electromag-
netic waves ol_1 the reproductive system and its function in mamls have appeared
recently 11—31]. As yet. however. the problem of the genetic effect of 8111’ range
microwaves retains little studied. The data on the nutagenicity of a SHF electro-
magnetic field available in the literature are contradictory. There are data on a
weak mta;enic__effgct of SB? microwaves during a_fra£tionated irradiation of bone
marrow cells [[0, 2/ and sex cells of sale mice _/_6, 1/. At the same time, other
studies did not reveal changes in the properties of nucleic acids of the sperm-
togenic epithgium 13/ or a mtagenic effect under the effect of SH? microwaves on
yeast cells A]. 'lhe results of studies of the codained effect of say microwaves,
chemical mtagens and radiation are difficult to compare and often contradictory

11o. 1y.

Material and methods. Ihe genetic effect of a single and fractioned action of SIP
range microwaves with energy flux density of 60 and 800 Iii/c1:2 and a wave length
of 12.6 cm (oscillation frequency 2.400 MHz) was studied. ‘lhia range encompasses
the upper and lower limits of the values of energy of a SH? electromagnetic field
most frequently used in practice. Hybrid sexually mature sale mice F1 (CBAXCS7BL)
were subjected to the action. Nonline white females were used in the variant with
a single action and both white nonline and hybrid females aged 2.5 to 1. months. in
the variant with a fractionated action. Every case had its own biological identi-
cal control, which ruled out the effect of the female genotype on ebryonal mor-
tality.

To detect the mtagenic effect of SH? microwaves, three tests were used: frequen-
cy of dominant lethal mtations in sex cells of male mice; frequency of anomlous
spermium heads and frequency of chromosome aberrations in bone narrow cells.

Males were irradiated on the Parus unit in an anechoic charter under a single ac-
tion for 12 min with energy flux density of 60 uw/cm2 and for 21 s with energy
fltn: density of 800 Inn/cm . the time of irradiation was chosen so that the level
' of lethal effect of microwaves did not exceed 102. In this investigation the mor-
tality of animals depending on the series of experiments ranged from 0.1 to 10%.

llmlur a fractionated action the conditions of irradiation were as follows: energy
flux density 800 mw/cm2 and time of irradiation 21 s once a day for 10 days at an
aubient temperature of 21-22 'C.

To detect dominant lethal mutations, intact females were exposed to irradiated
males for a week. Under a single effect the succession of six implantations

made guaranteed participation in fertilization of gametes irradiated at the stage
of mature spermia (first week), late spermtids (second week), early spermtids
(third week), late spermatocytes (fourth week). early sperms acytes (fifth week)
and spermatogonia (sixth week). In case of a fractionated action irradiation
lasted 10 days. Therefore, spermia irradiated at the stages of spermia and sper-
matids (firsr week), spermatids and spermtocytes (second and third weeks), sper-
matocytes (fourth week) and spermatogonia (fifth week) took part in fertilization.
The nuuber of iuplantations in this variant was five. Eighteen days after the be-
ginning of crossing the pregnant females were anesthetized and cut open. the per-
cent of embryonal death was determined on the basis of the ratio of the nunber of
yellow bodies in the ovary. places of inplantation and live embryos in the uterus.

The frequency of induced dominant lethal mtatioas was determined on the basis of
a comparison of the following indicators: survival rate of eubryos (ratio of the
number of live eabryos to the nunber of yellow bodies); death before implantation
(ratio of the difference between the number of yellow bodies and places of inlan-
tation to the number of yellow bodies); mortality of embryos after implantation
(ratio of the nuuber of dead enbryos to the hunter of places of iuplantation) [1:27.
Nrthermore. the percent of effective crossings and the weight of testes 1.5 days
after the action were determined. These indicators made it possible to judge the
effect of SHF microwaves on the reproductive capacity of the sales.

To count anomalous apermium heads, smears from the content of the epididymis were
prepared on the 35th day after the action. 'lhe frequency of anomalous heads of
mature spermia developgd_from irradiated spermtogonia attests to the mtagenicity
of the action factor 113/. No less than 300 spermtozoids from each of the six
males were investigated.

Chromosome disturbancgs_in bone marrow cells were analyzed in mtaphases on per-
manent preparations 115.] on completion of a 10-day fractionated irradiation.

It should be noted that standard methods of statistical analysis of the data on
dominant lethal mtations have not been developed conclusively to this day £27.
The method x2 for an evaluation of the differences in postimplantation mortality
between the experiment and control was used in this work. Another method of sta-
tistical processing was used in some cases ﬁg]. According to this method the
evaluation of errors was calculated on the basis of the following formula:

 

 

25'. n ISM—TY + =(x,—'x)' _2 Madman—F) '
2—K. II—l ' (up! (510‘ (ﬁ‘NEm)

 

where n is the nuuber of investigated females; x4: is the number of yellow bodies;
y; is the number of entryos in some females; x, y are the corresponding average

values calculated for all females.

The evaluation of the significance of differences was made according to Student's
«t-criterion.

Results of investigations and their discussion. Table 1 presents data on elbrymal
death caused by genetic disturbances arising in sex cells of sales as a result of a
single “C10“ of SE? microwaves. As can be seen from table 1, the average nutter
of yellow bodies, places of implantation and live embryos per female did not dif-
fer significantly between the experiment and control. Nor did we find statisti-
cally significant differences between the experth and control in postimplanta-
tion mortality. which, as is well known. is the basic indicator of the frequency .
of dominant lethal mutations. We would like to note that nongenetic factors, such
as the level of fertility of spermia. the nuaber of ovulated ova and so forth. can,
also have an effect on the_amounts of preimplantation losses and, accordingly, the
survival rate of entryos 1137. A certain increase in postimplantation mortality
observed under the effect on late spernatids (fourth week) proved to be statistic-
cally insignificant (x’-2.lo; P>0.05). Thus. induced dominant lethal mtations were
not detected atany stage of spermatogenesis.

The percent of effective crossings in the experimental groups of mice was even
slightly higher than the control level. Porty~five days after the action the
weight of testes did not differ from the control level. In control and experimen-
tal groups it averaged 207, 210 and 213 mg respectively.

Table 2 presents the results of analysis of eutryonsl mortality in the offspring
of males subjected to a fractionated irradiation. As follows from the data, in
this experimental variant, as well as under a single action. there were no differ-
ences between the experiment and control in the average number of yellow bodies,
places of implantation and live embryos per female. Under the effect on gametes
realized during the first 2 weeks after processing a small increase in postimplan-
tation mortality in the experiment was observed. In one case the differences bet-
ween the experiment and control proved to be statistically significant (xz-SJ; P
<0.05). However. it should be noted that, since the method X does not make it
possible to take into consideration the individual differences among females, in
this case we additionally used another method of statistical data processing 1127.
which did not confirm the statistical significance of the observed differences
($0.4; P>0.5). If the data on the contined effect of SR? microwaves on all the
stages of spermtogenesis are presented, as follows from table 2, the lack of a
Imtagenic effect can be seen clearly.

Under a fractionated. action of SB? microwaves disturbances in the form of spermium
heads were studied. According to the data in the literature, the period of 35 days
is optimal for the use of this indicator during a study of the effect of ionizing
radiation on apermatogenesis. because the largest nutter of anomalous heads is ob-
served during this period. It is assumed that anomalous spermium heads are formed
as a result of genetic disturbances 2f_the type of point mtations in sex cells
subjected to some mutagenic action 113/. As an analysis of the preparations
showed, the frequency of anomalous apermium heads in the experiment and control

was on the same level and averaged 1.6 and 1.62 respectively.

The results of study of the effect of SHF microwaves on bone narrow cells are pre-
sented in table 3. As follows from the data, the percent of aberrant metaphases in
the experiment and control comrised the same values.

Thus. not a single test used by us disclosed a mtagenic effect of SHF microwaves
under the given experimental conditions. A comparison of our results with the
data on this problem in the literature often is difficult. because the conditions

of irradiation are not comparable. Thus, with a local irradiation of mouse testes
a_wea§ increase in the frequency of induced dominant lethal mtations was obtained
16. 1]. However. no pattern in a rise in the level of mutations depending on the
stage of spermtogenesis subjected to the effect was observed. If another method
of statistical processing is used, that is, the number of yellow bodies, places of
iuplantation and live edaryos is presented in the form of an average number per
female, the differences between the experiment and control in these studies will
prove to be insignificant. Another author _/_57 obtained a mtagenic effect of SE?
microwaves under a fractionated action on bone marrow cells. However, the condi-
tions of irradiation in our experiment differ from those used in the above-mentioned
study. which makes a comarison of results difficult. An analysis of the data from
sources in the literature available to us mites it possible to assume that, appar-
ently, the degree of a mtagenic effect or its absence depends primarily on thecon-
ditions of the action. In the opinion of some authors. to this da there are no
direct proofs of a specific nonthermal effect of SHF microwaves _ll7, because there
are no data on the existence of a molecular interaction of the biosystem with the
absorbed energy of a SIIF electromgnetic field. Proceeding from the above-stated.

it is possible to explain the lack of a mtagenic effect in our experiments.

when this article had already been prepared for the press, a study confirming the
data obtained by us on the lack of a nutsgenic effect of SHF microwaves in sex

cells of manuals appeared. The authors, varying the timeof admonic irradiation of
rule rats with SHF microwaves with energy flux density of 5 and lO ﬂ/cmz. did not
detect induced dominant lethal untations or a decrease in the fertility of ani-

M19 55/.

Conclusions. As a result of the study of a single action of SE? microwaves with
energy flux density of 60 and 800 mil/cm2 and of a fractionated action of SE? mic-
rowaves with energy flux density of 800 WICIIZ on sex and somatic cells of ale
mice, a mtagenic effect of this factor was not revealed by any of the tnree used
tests (frequency of induced dominant lethal mtations; frequency of anomlous sper-
mium heads and frequency of chromosome aberrations in bone narrow cells).

The authors are grateful to V. S. Lysenkova and N. V. Chernysheva for their help

[Text] The reactions of organs isolated from the effects of imunological factors
by histohematic barriers are of special interest to experimental morphology. It is
possible to investigate the role of antibodies and sensitized lymphoid cells in
development of autoimmune processes on models of damage to the brain, peripheral
nervous system, testes, thyroid and eye (V. V. Serov, 1968; A. D. Ado, 1972; A. I.
Strukov, 1972).

Heretofore, the study of the testes by inunomorphological methods had been conducted
in experiments where traumatic factors (8. S. Raytsina, 1970), imunization with
antigens of homologous testes (J. Freund et al., 1955: B. H. Haksman, 1959; P. C.
Brown et al., 1963) and cross-reacting antigens of microorganisms (R. P. Ogurtsov
and Yu. N. Zubzhitskiy, 1978) were the triggering mechanisms of the process.

A superhigh-Erequency electromagnetic field (SH? M) of nonthermal intensity elicits
aspermatogenesis and development of lymphoid infiltrates in testicular interstitial
tissue, even with brief exposure (V. V. Grigor'yev, 1978). Since this affect cannot
be sttr1‘-:ted to the thermal effect of the field on cells, there is reason to
believe that the damage is possibly related to lesion to the hamstoteaticular
barrier (ms) and is associated with development of an imnopathological process.

Our objective here was to make a study of the possibility of development of an
insane reaction to testicular antigens and its relation to impairment of structure
and permeability of the MB under the influence of 8H? m of nonthermal intensity,
using inunomorphological, histological methods and electron microscopy.

Material and Methods

Experiments were conducted on 77 puberal male rabbits weighing 2.5-3 kg. The
testes were submitted to local irradiation for 6 min delivered from a Lucia-58

radiotherapy machine (wavelength 12.6 cm, intensity 8.8 mH/cmz). The control group
consisted of 15 nonirradiated rabbits. The animals were weighed 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21,
30, 60, 90 and 210 days after exposure, sacrificed by decapitation, after which the
testes, blood and spleen were taken for examination. We determined the ratio of
red to white pulp mass of the spleen by the method of Gammar, as well as weight of
the testes and the animal. Various parts of the same testis wrre fixed according
to Carnoy and Colfield, the spleen according to Carnoy and imbedded in paraffin,
and the testes were also imbedded in epon. 812. Part of the testis was frozen in'a
mixture of ice and petroleum ether to obtain cryostat sections. The paraffin sec-
tions were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, while the ultrafine sections were con-
trasted with uranyl acetate and lead nitrate. The preparations were viewed under
a light microscope and type JD! 100 CX electron microscope.

For demonstration of antibody globulin fixed in the testes, the cryostat sections
were eluated for 10 min in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and, after drying, incubated
with FI‘l'i‘s [fluorescein isothiocyanatel-labeled antirabbit serum (produced by the
Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology imeni N. P. Gama'leya,
USSR Academy of Medical Sciences). Antibodies to antigens of rabbit testes were
assayed in blood serum with the complement fixation test under refrigeration (V. I.
Ioffe and K. H. Rozental', 1943) with homologous testicular extract in a dosage

of 1 mg/ml protein and by the indirect imunofluorescence method (‘1'. H. Weller and
A. H. Coons, 1954), using cryostat sections of homologous testes fixed in 96°
ethanol as antigen.

vaersensitivity of the delayed type was tested after 9, 14, 30 and 90 days, for
which purpose a group of 17 experimental and 6 control animals was given intra-
cutaneous injections of homologous testicular extract (in doses of 1-0.01 nag/ml
per rabbit). The reaction was evaluated 24 h after the injection.

In order to examine permeability of the HTB 1 and 14 days after irradiation, we
gave intravenous injections of 3 m2. ox serum albumin in a concentration of

100 mg/mt/kg animal weight, conjugated with rhodamire chlorideor Evans blue dye.
After 2 h, the testes were removed, cryostat sections prepared and examined under
an HL-4 fluorescence microscope with UPS-3 and $28-14 light filters, and ZhS-3
ocular filter.

Results and Discussion

The experimental animals were divided into three groups, according to the individual
reactions to the deleterious effects of SH]? 84F.

The first group (25 rabbits) developed mild reactive changes in the testes, mani-
fested by death of only a few cells of the spermatogenic epithelium in both cen-
trally situated tubules and near the testicular membrane after 1-3 days. After
5-6 days, spermatogenesis was virtually normal.

Already 1 day after exposure, the second group (22 rabbits) presented microscopic
hemorrhages, which were the most extensive in the region of the testicular rete.
Lymphoid infiltrates were formed in areas with hemorrhages after 2-5 days. The
damage to the testis was notably nonuniform: complete atrophy of spermatogenic epi~
thelium in the region of hemorrhages and adjacent zone, confined to the lobules,
whereas in tubules of adjacent lobules removed from the lesion site the process of
spermatogenesis continued.

In the third group (30 animals), the changes in spemtogenic epithelium were the
most significant; after 1 day spermatozoa disappeared, spermatids and spermatocytes
were sloughed off, the nuaber of mltinuclear elenents derived from sex cells in-
creased. After 2-3 days, there was appearance of lymphoid infiltrates (chiefly

in interstitial tissue near the tunica albuginea) (Figure l, a, 6). Sone lymphoid
cells infiltrated the seminiferous tubules. At the later postradiation stages, the
dystrophic changes in convoluted seminiferous tubules and lymphoid infiltration of

testicular tissues progressively increased and reached a maxim between the 6th
and 16th day.

After 14 days, electron microscopy revealed severe changes, primarily in the struc—
ture of the tunica propria of the convoluted tubules (see Fig“re l, a, P). There
was no longer parallel arrangement and spatial correlation between layers; there
was an increase in amount of vesicular structures in them, as well as in the cells
of the basal zone of the tubules, particularly in sustentocytes. The cells no '
longer had a capacity for pinocytosis, whereas their topography became jagged due
to intensified flow of metabolic products through them.

Testicular atrophy was associated with reduction of their mass in the second and
third groups of animals. The relative mass of the testes decreased to 90°10’517-10‘5
after 3days, remaining low after 5 days and coming close to normal (140-10-5225-10—5)
only after 7 days. The third group of animals presented loss of mass again after 60
and particularly after 90 days (to 95-10-523-10‘5).

The lesion demonstrable at the early stages could be related to the deleterious
effects of SHF EMF on testicular tissues. Appearance of lymphoid infiltration

at the later stages was indicative of development of an immune reaction to testicular
antigens (H. H. wnksmun, 1959; S. S. Raytsina, 1970). This reaction could be directed
to antigens of borh injured and uninjured tissue, if they entered the blood stream

due to impairment of "TB structure after exposure to the field. To test this assump-
tion, experiments were conducted to evaluate permeability of the “TB under the in-

fluence of SHF EMF.

Already 1 day after exposure, there was accumulation of albumin in interstitial
tissue between the seminiferous tubules in the region of the vessels, and after 14
days albumin was demonstrable within the tubules (see Figure 1, n), which was
apparently related to impaired permeability of the HTB.

Antigenic stimulation of lymphoid tissue altered the proportion of white and red
pulp mass of the spleen. It constituted 0.16 in control rabbits, 0.23 in experimental
animals after 1 day, with reduction of white pulp mass to almost one-half after 3
days. Later on, the mass thereof increased again, reaching a maximum after 14 days
(0.34), again reverting to normal after 21 days; however, it increased reliably
again after 30 days.

In some rabbits, complement-fixing antibodies (in a titer not exceeding 1:10)
appeared in blood serum 5-7 days after exposure to SE? field. Starting on the 20th
day, they were demonstrable only in animals of the second and third groups, in
titers of l:20-l:b0. The blood serum of these groups of rabbits also presented
antibodies on the 20th day (in titers of 1:20-1:60) capable of specific reactions
in the indirect immunofluorescence method with spermatid structures on sections of
the testis (Figure 2). Examination of cryostat sections of testes treated with
fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled antirabbit serum revealed fixing of globulins
both on spermatids and spermatozoa, as well as the external surface of the tunica
propria of the seminiferous tubules, 20, 30 and 90 days after exposure to SR? EH?
(Figure 3). Complement-fixing and fluorescent antibodies were demonstrable up to
the 90th day after exposure (Figure 6), whereas in the third group of animals comple-
ment-fixing antibodies were even demonstrable after 7 months, in a titer of 1:20.

The reaction of hypersensitivity of the delayed type revealed positive skin tests

strable after 30 and 90 days, with build-up of intensity, only in the third group
(Table).

Concluslon

The capacity of blood serum antibodies to react in the indirect fluorescence test
with spermatid structures is indicative of their being directed against autoanti-
gens of the testis (G. A. Voisin and F. Toullet, 1969).

There are grounds to believe that the inmmnological reaction complicates the course
of the reactive process in the testis. This is related, in the first place, to
development of hypersensitivity of the delayed type to autoandgensand appearance

of lymphocytes in testicular tissue and, in the second place, to appearance of anti-
bodiea capable of fixing complement and having a cytotoxic effect on testicular
cells. In the latter case, the impaired permeability of the HTB allows immuno-
globulins to enter into the convoluted seminiferoua tubules or interact with auto-
antigens discharged from the seminiferous tubules. Different antigens are fixed
differently on testicular structures. The two types of fixation of globulins that

we demonstrated (on the spermatogenic epithelium and tunica propria of the tubules)
confirm this assumption.

Thus, local exposure of the testes to superhigh-frequency electromagnetic fields of
nonthermal intensity shows that both immunological mechanisms-~humora1 (antibodies)

and cellular (sensitized lymphocytes)--have a deleterious effect on the testes in
the presence of impaired MTB permeability.

EFFECT OF INDUSTRIAL CURRENT EWNETIC FIELD UPON NATURE 0? GROWTH AND HITOTIG
ACTIVITY OF HUMAN FIBROBLAST CELL CULTURE

3 Dec 79) pp 9-12
[Article by V.D. Dyshlovoy, A.3. Panchuk, and v.8. Kachura, Kiev Medical Institute]

[Text] Introduction. Growing interest in the study of the effects of musical
factors of an electromagnetic nature upon man and the environment has come about
as the result of widespread introduction of generating sources for those factors.
Specifically, a need for researching the nature of changes occurring in animals
and man resulting from the effects of electromagnetic fields of 503s (M sons)
has arisen in conjunction with the introduction into operation of electric power
transmission lines (1.3?) of the high and super-high current categories having power-
ful electromagnetic fields in the area of the conducting surfaces [1,2]. Although
data on the nature of biological effects and the degree of potential danger are

at this time questionable, there is no doubt that it is booming an important
ecological and hygienic factor (3-5]. Additionally, the study of the nature of
changes occurring in the organism and its cells as the result of the effects of
electromagnetic fields is one of the most powerful instruments for learning their
structures and functions, as many processes in the organism are electromagnetic
transformation based.

Particularly significant in establishing the nature and biological effect of EMF,
specifically its direct effect upon cellular structure would be research anploy'ing
cell cultures as a model subject [6]. This article presents study results relating
to the nature of changes occuring under the influence of 5032 M in human albryonic
cell cultures.

Materials and Methods. Subject of the research was primary cultures of mbryonic
fibroblast cell cultures from human embryos, cultivated in covered glass according
to accepted methods. The electromagnetic field was created between plates of a
capacitor in a thermostatically controlled chamber. Required field current was
achieved by varying the current on the plates or the distance between them. After

Statistical analysis of digital material was made with the "Mir-1" caputer elploy-
ing the Student-Fisher method for comparing aggregates with mutually related
variants. The studies were conducted using 58 cultures.

Research results and discussion. Under nonnal conditions, human embryonic fibro-
blast cells in culture are polygonal in shape, and possess a large number of cyto-
plasmic extensions or appendages, which, as a rule, contact the extensions of other
cells, fanning at given stages of culture development the so-called "nonolayer".
Layers of culture monolayer cells have a different orientation in the substrate.
with daily 5-hour exposure to 5032 EMF, on day 5 or 6, a reduced number of cytoplasm-
ic extensions is noted in the fibroblast cells. On subsequent days, the cells are
more rounded, and often lose contact with each other. with constant 2h-hour expo-
sure to field effect of the same or different current, changes are analogous, but
somewhat more expressed during the same study periods. Subsequently, a portion

of the cells creeps from the substrate, and "windows", free from cells, appear on
the glass, usually colonized by young cells. In those cultures subjected to EN?
exposure, morphological characteristics of the nuclear segments of the cells change,
that is, the number of improperly formed nuclei--dense, vacuolized, and containing
large quantities of condensed chromatin, increases.

With intensified field current to 100kV/h, rounding of the cytoplasm was recorded
by day 3 or k, and subsequently a segment of cells loses contact with each other,
and the orientation of cell strata in the monolayer is disrupted. The effect of

a 1SOkV/m field results in more clearly expressed degenerative changes: the cyto-
plasm concentrates, cells reduce in dimension, frequently lying isolated, monolayer
strata orientation is disrupted, and nuclei virtually devoid of cytoplasm are
encountered. with extended exposure to EMF, nuclear fonms change, forming "windows"
as the result of a segment of cells creeping from the substrate; those ”windows"
are not colonized by young cells. At the same time, total loss of irradiated
cultures was observed only in single instances. It must be noted, that rapidity

of onset and pronounced nature of changes were dissimilar in various cultures, which
apparently is related to the condition of theinitialembryonic material from which
the cultures were prepared, and to individual peculiarities of their development.

18

Parallel with an evaluation of the general state of the cultures in a dynamic state
with 1 to 8 day exposure of EM? SOkV/m current. certain indicators were studied
relating to the rate of their reproduction by determining mitotic activity.

Research demonstrated that under normal conditions. the number of cells dividing

in the cultures throughout the entire period of observation was maintained at the
same approximate level. The average value of the mitotic index was 1.’o--10.20/00,
characteristic for cultures in the stationary development period. Under the effect
of the field, a gradual reduction in the number of dividing cells is seen and. toward
the end of the 24-hour period of exposure to EMF, differences attained statistically
significant levels (table 1). Hith increased eaposure time, the mitotic index

drops by an approxinately equal value in every observation period.

The results obtained in this series of experiments provide a basis for mothesising
that increases in exposure times to the field will result in s more pronounced re-
duction in the nmber of dividing cells. To verify this hypothesis, the following

series of rinents were conducted in which the time of field exposure was in-
creased to ‘4 hours with the same intensity.

As can be seen from table 2, after a hB-hour field exposure during the experiment,
a statistically significant (P less than 0.01) reduction in the mitotic index of
29.75 is noted. Subsequently, after cessation of the exposure, mitotic activity
in the experimental testtubes grows more intensively than in the control, and in
12 hours, the differences between the control and the experiment become statisti-
'cally insignificant (P greater than 0.05).

Comparison of the results from the first two series of experiments indicates that
with increased time of field exposure by a factor of two, no adequate increase of
reaction in cultures including increased degree of decreased mitotic activity was
observed. This may be related to the fact that the researched factor, after a
short-term exposure is sufficient to disrupt the normal course of the cellular
cycle, and further increases in time of its effect does not lead to more pronounced
changes. It can also be hypothesised that the reduction in the mitotic index
occurs as the result of damage to only a part of the cells, i.e.. those most sensi-
tive at a particular tine to the effect of M. A second, more resistant group

of cells continues to pass through the cellular cycle and divide.

To verify the hypothesis regarding the absence of a direct link between extended
field exposure and the degree of reduction in the mitotic index, the following
series of experiments exposed cultures to a field over a 7-dav period. Every 1-

2 days, the mitotic index of a segment of teettubes in the control and the meri-
ment was determined.

growth in the mitotic activity in tha begin to drop.

the condition of the cultures under the effect of 50113 m are related to the

Materials and Methods

The research was conducted on '49 male rabbits of the chinchilla variety weighing
2.5 kg which had electrodes for stimulation implanted beforehand in the area of
the ventro-medial nuclei of the hypothalamus. Only those animals displaying a
passive-defensive reaction to the electrical current stimulation of the ventra-
modial nuclei of the hypothalamus (intensity 2-8 v, 5032 frequency) were selected
for the experiment.

During the experiments, the rabbits were kept immobilized in stalls, and administer-
ed alternating and simultaneous short-term stimulation to the hypothalamus and
various skin segments. Aporiodic stimulation demonstrated the most pronounced
stressogenic effects (Abramov, 1973: Mamedov, Shumilina, 1975; Weiss, 1971). The
electrical stimulation was effected using needle electrodes implanted in the skin
of the front and rear extremities, and also by special clamps or terminals attached
to the rabbits' are. Imputs were employed which elicited an elevation of arterial
pressure on the order of 20-30 mm of mercury without a pronounced motor reaction of
the animal. The rabbit received six stimulations during a 10 minute period. An
impulse current 10-15v, SOHz was employed for nociseptive effect. Duration of a
single impulse was 20 msec. Each stimulation lasted from 1-10 secs. Each animal
had a catheter implanted in the femoral arterty, and through the use of a tensometer
and myngograph of the "Siemens-Elena" firm, the arterial pressure and cardiac
contraction frequency were recorded.

The condition of the neurons and the metabolism of certain cellular formations of the
peripheral allttmo‘ﬂic nervous system was studied using cytochemical methods provid-
ing information on indicators noticeably changing during the process of the nervous
system functioning. Thus, the results of the biochemical and cytochemical research
uniformly demonstrate the presence of relationships between the state of functional
activity and the level of nerve tissue protein metabolism (Palladin, 1959; Brodskiy,
1966). Based upon the example of the study of proteins differing in chemical
properties in structures of the nodal, superior cervical, and stellate ganglia, to
include the segment of the sympathetic circuit at a level of 11-6 thoracic segments,
an attempt was made to determine the nature of changes occurring in them during the
course of acute emotional stress. Changes in metabolism of nerve cells also served
as an indicator of their functional state (Geynisman, 19716). The content of water
soluble proteins in the structures studied was determined according to Lowry (lowry,
at al., 1951). The results were processed statistically according to the non-
parametric criterion of Van der Varden (1960). To establish the dry weight of the
cytoplasm and neuron nuclei, volumes of nuclei and nerve cell bodies of the nodal—
vagus nerve and the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion were fixed in Carnot‘s
liquid and poured into paraffin. The dry weight of the cytoplasm and neuron nuclei
was determined by the interferometry method with sections 7mm using an interfero-
metric microscope of the "Opton" firm. The volume of neurons studied and their
nuclei was determined according to the formula of ellipsoidal rotation

Research of mononuclear and dinuclear cells of the superior cervical ganglion was
conducted separately. All digital material was processed statistically according
to the method of variational statistics (Plokhinskiy, 1970). The correlation of
aerobic and anerobic carbohydrate conversions was studied using the electrophoresis
method in polyacrylamide gel, determining content of lactate dehydrogenase (LDG)
isoenzymes in the cited formations of the nervous system as well as in the function-
ing organ--the heart, anatomically related to these structures, and separately in
the conductive system of the heart, isolating the atrioventricular fascicle with
elements of the right crus of the His bundle (A—V bundle) (Umovist, Sinev, 1969).

A quantitative evaluation was made of the activity of individual isoenzymes using
the recording IFO-h51 micmphotometer produced by the Kazan' Optioo-Mechanical Plant.

Serving as control in the cytochemical research were rabbits maintained in a
vivarium.

According to the nature of changes in arterial pressure in animals under emotional
stress, it was possible to isolate three groups irrespective of initial hemodynamic
parameters (fig. 1).

The first group was composed of rabbits whose arterial pressure did not change

throughout the experiment. An instability of frequency of cardiac contractions
was seen; an increase in it and a decrease, as well. was noted. Ami-ale of this
group (6 rabbits) we designated as stable to the action of stressogenic factors.

The second group 01' animals (11 rabbits) developed changes in arterial pressure

not resulting in death. With a portion of the rabbits, arterial pressure at the
beginning of the experiment dropped by 17.0111 .3 mm of mercury, and frequency of
cardiac contractions increased by 50 in 1 minute. A gradual increase of arterial
pressure and a certain reduction of cardiac contraction frequency was then observed.
Within 1.5--2.0 hours after the beginning of the experiment, arterial pressure in-
creased by 28.0:20.6 mm compared to the initial level, and the frequency of cardiac *
contractions on average increased by 90 in 1 minute (5 rabbits). The other set

of animals (6 rabbits) demonstrated increased arterial pressure at the onset of

the experiment by 5.823.? mm, and within 1.5--2.0 hours a steady reduction of
23312.? mm from the initial level. Pr uency of cardiac contractions for the dura-
tion of the experiment increased by 50-— 0 per 1 minute. The animals of this group
we evaluated as adaptive.

The third group included animals termed predisposed to the development of stress,
dying during the course of the experiment (3'1 rabbits). This group was broken down
into three subgroups. The first subgroup included those animals (8 in umber) which
expired within 15-40 minutes from the beginning of the experiment. Those animals
evidenced, with the administering of the initial stimulations, elevation of arterial
pressure by 16.029.11 mm with insignificant increase or reductiou in cardiac contrac-
tions, followed by a sharp reduction of arterial pressure, cardiac contraction
frequency, and death. Rabbits of the second subgroup (16 animals) with the onset
of the experiment demonstrated a gradual drop in pressure, resulting in their deaths
within 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Frequency of cardiac contractions in these rabbits for
the duration of the experiment was. on the average, 55 higher than the initial level
and reduced to the moment of death. With animals of the third subgroup (10 rabbits),
a unique phasic nature of changes was detected. With onset of the stimulation,

the arterial pressure either increased insignificantly, or did not change: frequency
of cardiac contractions remained stable. After this, arterial pressure dropped
below the initial level by 13.03143 mm, and remained so for 1.0 to 1.5 hours with

a frequency of cardiac contractions 50-100 per 1 minute greater than the initial
frequency. A subsequent secondary elevation of arterial pressure then developed

by h0.0:11.3 mm, accompanied by a reduction in cardiac contraction frequency to

the initial level. Death occurred at the peak of the arterial pressure elevation.

Thus, data was obtained indicating that in a population of rabbits of the chinchilla
variety, individual animals are encountered demonstrating varying stabilities of
cardiac-vascular functions to acute experimental emotional stress.

Cytochemical research has demonstrated that a definite reduction of watersoluble
protein content occurs in nodal ganglia homogenates in rabbits predisposed to the
deve10pment of stress (Table 1). In homogenates of the stellate ganglion, a defin-
ite increase in their content was detected relative to the control, and in the
sympathetic circuit, only a tendency toward increased content was noted. The con-
tent of watersoluble proteins in homogenates of the superior cervical ganglion

did not differ from the control animals.

A morphological analysis indicated that in those rabbits predisposed to the develop-
ment of stress, the volume of cell bodies with mononuclear neurons of the superior
cervical and nodal ganglia and their nuclei, as well as the volume of dinuclear
neurons of the superior cervical ganglion was definitely reduced relative to the

control (tables 2,3). The weight of dry cytoplasm and nuclei of mononuclear neurons,
nuclei of dinuclear neurons of the superior cervical ganglion, and of nodal ganglion
nuclei were substantially below the level of the control (tables l3,5). Protein

concentration in the cytOplasm and nodal ganglion nuclei was definitely higher than
the control, vhile at the same time, its level in superior cervical sympathetic
ganglion neuron cytoplasm did not differ from that of the control.

In other words, facts are presented which indicate that during emotional stress in
rabbits predisposed to its development, changes in metabolic activity of both the
sympathetic system and the vagus nerve structures occur. In the stellate ganglion
and the sympathetic circuit (trunk), the change of metabolic activity takes place

as a predominance of anabolic processes, indicated by the increased content of water-
soluble protein, particularly important in the accomplishment of cellular functions,
including providing for mediator synthesis. In the superior cervical ganglion, a
reduction occurred of structural protein content in cytoplasm of mononuclear and di-
nuclear neuron nuclei, progressing against a background of maintaining uatersoluble
protein content at a normal level. The reduction noted in the nodal ganglion of
uatersoluble and structural proteins in nerve cell nuclei bears witness to the pre-
dominance there or catabolic processes (tables 6,7). This appears probable, inasmuch
as the noted increases in protein content in the nuclei and cytoplasm of nodal gang-
lion neurons does not indicate a reduction in their rates of protein synthesis. The
predominance of catabolic processes in the nodal ganglion may indicate a functional
overstress or its structure.

It is possible that under conditions of stress, with the effect of the extraordinary
stimulation, a rapid mobilization of the organism' s reserves occurs, where energy in
this instance is fomed not only by the most effective neans-—oxidising phosphor—yie-
tion and glycolysis, but through a decomposition of proteins, possibly one of the

neurons are dependent upon the oxidizing conversion of carbohydrates, whereas excitation
of nerve cells in the transynaptic transmission of nerve impulses to a great degree is
associated with glycolytic processes. An absence of shifts in the correlation of

the autonomic nervous system, but bears witness to the great level of balance in
their metabolism. It is known that only long-tom (sore than 8 hours) stimulation
of the pro-ganglion fibers of the superior cervical ganglion in cats may result in
a reduction of up content (Kalyunov, 1975). With short-tern stimulation of the
superior cervical ganglion, reduction of ATP content is achieved only after with-
drawal from a perfused solution of glucose.

*t--Studont's criterion of reliability

 

In the study of rabbits' functioning nyocardia, specifically those dying under

stress conditions, changes could not be established in the correlation of myocardium
LDC isoenzyne activities (table 8, figure 3). The spectrum of rabbit wooerdim

LDC isoenzynes indicates that in the cardiac muscle, the conversion of carbohydrates
is accomplished by aerobic means. In those animals dying under stress conditions,
there occurred a pronounced tendency toward changes in IDC isoenzyle correlations
(table 9, figure ). The correlation again occuring with isoensyne fraction brought
the LDC spectrum of the cardiac conductive system closer to the functioning myocardial
LDC spectrum. An analysis of biochemical mechanic-s underlying pernicious effects of
emotional stress upon the heart, conducted in the laboratory of F.Z. Heyerson (1979),
demonstrates the decisive role of glucoccrticosteroids and catecholamines. Such a
metabolic disorder of the nyocardiua is not related to reactions of the energy pro-
vision of the cardiac muscle, and ATP concentration in the mcardia of animals
under stress does not change; the latter closely agrees vith our observations on the
maintenance of the nomal LDC spectrum in the functioning ayecardim of rabbits
during emotional stress. A change of the LDC isoenzyne spectra of the conductive

system under stress indicates the close relationship of tissue metabolic processes

and the functional state of the heart. We demonstrated that with the control

animals, LDC isoenzyme spectrum of the conductive system is classified as cardiac,

but relative to the spectrum of the functioning myocardium, includes more pronounced
slow fraction (Figure h). Stimulation of the negative emotionogenic zones of the
hypothalamus resulted in changes in the conductive system's TDG spectrum: a growth
was noted in the activity or the rapid "cardiac" isoenzymes. Thus, emotional stress

is accompanied by changes in the course of energy processes in the tissues of the
cardiac conductive system, and this must influence also its functional characteristics.

Data was obtained to the effect that not all individuals of the population of
chinchilla variety rabbits develop identical cardiac-vascular disturbances with the
stimulation of the negative emotionogenic zones of the hypothalamus. The nature
of the changes in cardiac-vascular reactions permits the establishment of three

groups of animals: stable, adaptive, and predisposed to the development of stress.
This information is novel.

It was established that not all cellular formations of the peripheral autonomic
nervous system are involved to the same degree in the stress process, with greatest
changes detected in the neural structures of the nodal ganglion of the vagus nerve,
where a disruption was established in the metabolism of proteins, that process being
catabolic in nature, and conversely anabolic processes developed in neurons of the
stellate ganglion and the sympathetic circuit, and the superior cervical sympathetic
ganglion occupies an intermediate position. The observations cited indicate the
preeminent role of the vagus nerve system in the development of acute experimental
stress. The cardiac conductive system undergoes changes in the energy exchange: -
these shifts may be of considerable significance in the pathogenesis of emotional

stresses of varying origin.

[Text] Information regarding the effect of microwaves on the body of animals and
man has been generalized in a number of suuariee [Presmam A. 8., 1965; Tolgskaya.
H. S. and Gordon. 2. V., 1971; Hinin. B. A.. 1974]. However the structural-
metabolic changes in the muscle tissues in microwave injury to the body have been
covered extremely little in the literature. especially where modern research '
methods have been employed.

This work presents the results of a study on the effect of the energy of super-
high frequency. of low-intensity electromagnetic field on the ultraatmctural orga-
nization of the skeletal muscle tissue of developing chick esbryos.

Material and Technique

In the first series of experisents. 16 chick embryos of the Legorn breed were
irradiated on the seventh, eighth and ninth days of esbryonal development. In the
second series. 15 embryos were irradiated on the 12th. 13th and lloth days of de-
velopment. Thirty unirradiated embryos of the same chick breed were the control.
Chick eggs weighing 5032.5 g were irradiated for 20 min with a superhigh frequeacy
field with wavelength of 12.6 cs and power flux density (PFD) equal to 10 ail/cm .
The microwave generator was a "hath—58" unit. The P?!) was controlled with the
help of a "PO-l" instrument at s distance of 60 cm fros the microwave emitter

in the location plane of the study object.

The skeletal muscles (m. tibialis anterior) of the eabryoswere studied on the 12th.
16th and 19th days of incubation and on the 3rd day after hatching. Tissue
fragments were fixed in a 2.51 solution of glutaric aldehyde for 2 h and
additionally treated with a 11 solution of Cook for l h. The fixatives were
prepared in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer with sucrose (pl! 7.10). The speciaens were
dehydrated in alcohol-acetone and poured into araldite. Sections were pre-
pared on an LKB-III ultratome, contrast—stained with uranyl acetate and lead,
and examined under a L'EMV-IOO K electron microscope. Specimens from three-nine
animals for each period of study were used for stereosetric analysis. Morpho-
netry of the cellular organoids was done with a Haibel system [Heibeh _F.. P...
et al.. 1966; Kiseleva, Ye. V.. et al.. 19710]. The following were analyzed

in the suscle elements: volumetric density of the mitochondria located on the

Study Results

In the first group of irradiated embryos, on the 12th day of incubation, indivi—
dual muscle fibers were found in the skeletal muscle tissue whose myofibrils
occupied a greater area of the myon as carpeted to the control. and whose cross
striation of the myofibrils was poorly pronounced. The mitochondria in these myone
were smaller and the cristae were destroyed. On the whole. the structure of the

muscle tissue did not differ significantly from the control.

In the skeletal muscle tissue of the l6-l9-day old irradiated embryos. expansion
of the perinuclear spaces in the myosatellites and the mscle fibers. and the
presence of different-sized vacuoles in the sarcoplasm were observed. The nuclei
of the muscle fibers contained large nucleoli and had numerous protrusions of
the karyolemna. This indicates their hyperfunctioning. The sarcoplasm contained

a large number of spiral polysomes and glycogen granules. The mitochondria were
swollen. Some of them had destroyed cristae (fig l,a). Disintegration of the myo-

fibrils was defined in individual myons. The altered muscle fibers were adjoined
by myosatellites. Their number was greater as compared to the control (see fig

l.b). when contracted muscles were fixed, the sarcolelna of the myons formed
numerous protrusions.

In 3-day-old irradiated chicks. a number of muscle fibers contained a large number
of fatty inclusions (see fig l.c). The mitochondria formed accumulations in the

center of the fiber. Hyosatellites adjoined the altered myons. At the site of
contact between the myosatellites and the muscle fiber. vesicle-formation and

ruptures of the cytolelmna were observed. This is associated with the merging of
the myosatellite and the myon.

.a In the second group of embryos that were irradiated on the thh-lloth day of
development. a set of ultrastructural changes in the muscle fibers was found that
was similar to the first group. However. the processes of destruction were

less pronounced. The compensatory-adaptive reactions of the muscle and other
tissues in the muscle as an organ were traced more clearly.

Hyosatellites with expanded perinuclear spaces (see fig l.d) were defined in the
muscles of the l6-l9-day-old embryos of the second series of experiments. The
peripheral mitochondria of the myons were swollen. with partially destroyed cristae.
Individual myons had sections of ceraceous necrosis of the myofibrils. The

skeletal muscles of the 3-day-old chicks had numerous polysomes in the peripheral
part of the myons and large mitochondria with electron-dense matrix (fig 2.a).

The cytoplasm of the capillary endotheliocytes contained a large quantity of
pinocytic vesicles. This may indicate in favor of activation of transcapillary

transfer of macromolecular compounds (see fig 2.b).
The data from stereo-etric study of skeletal muscles in the control and second

group of embryos are given in the table. In the myons of the skeletal muscles of
lé-day-old irradiated embryos. an increase was noted in the volumetric myofibril

and the numerical density of the subsarcolemma mitochondria by 262 as compared

to the control. The lipid content doubled in the myons of the irradiated embryos.
The centrally located mitochondria changed quantitatively little.

1n the 3-day-old experimental chicks. the volumetric lipid density tripled in the
muscle fibers. The surface area diminished reliably by 381 and the numerical

density by 342 of the centrally located mitochondria.
Discussion of the Findings

The conducted study shows that with irradiation by a SHF field of nonthermogenic

intensity of chick embryos. the set of ultrastructural changes in the myons of
the first group of embryos is more pronounced than in the second group. This

may be associated with the developmental features of the skeletal muscle tissue.
The seventh-ninth days of development of the chick embryos are characterized by a

36

transition from myoblastic to myosymplastic stage of myogenesis. In this period.
the primitive nerve-muscle synapses appear for the first time [Atsumi. 8.. 1971;
Kikuchi. T. and Ashmore. C. R., 1976]. The thh-léth days of embryonal develop-
ment are a period of intensive myofibril genesis occurring under nerve control.
The greater sensitivity of the early stages of myogenesis (stage of myosylplasta
and myotubes) to SHE-irradiation is apparently associated with reconstruction of
the intracellular processes for synthesis of myofibrillar proteins and the lack
of sufficient nerve-trophic effect. The more pronounced sensitivity of the myo-
tthes to the effect of radiation as compared to the myoblasts and muscle fibers
has been described in the works of A. A. Klishov (1971).

In addition to the processes of destruction. reactive-restorative processes are
found in the skeletal muscle tissue which occur on the intracellular and cellular-
tissue levels of organization. They are expressed as hyperplasia and hypertrophy
of the orgsnoids. activation of protein synthesis, and increase in the number

of myosatellites. The myosatellites are probably less sensitive to the damaging
effect of the SHF-field by the myogenic elements. When the myosatellites merge
with the damaged muscle fiber, the nuclear apparatus of the myon is restored and

the reparative processes are improved since the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio in-
creases.

In embryos of 16-day development the content of myofibrils increases in the myons.
This reflects the intensification of protein synthesis in response to the effect
of the SHF-field. This agrees with the previously conducted study on protein
biosynthesis in muscle tissue of irradiated chick embryos using labeled amino
acids and cytospectrophotometry [Danilov. R. K. and Yegorova. L. 1., 1977].
lntensification of protein synthesis in the myons is accompanied by a doubling in
the numerical density of mitochondria. Increase in the number of mitochondria

in the cells. according to the data of l. S. Nikol'skaya and L. I. Radzinskaya

(1976). and N. D.0zernyuk (1978) indicates intensification of the load and rise
in oxygen consumption.

From the l6th to the 19th day of development, the rates of accumulation of con-
tractile proteins in the muscles of the irradiated chick embryos is considerably
lower than in the control. The content of myofibrillar proteins in the muscle
tissue in the control and in the experiment are equalized. In l9-day-old experi-
mental embryos, the subsarcolemma mitochondria suffer the most strongly in the
myons. This is probably associated with the heterogeneity of differentiation

of the central and peripheral mitochondria during the development of the muscle
elements. According to the data of H. Muller ([976), the peripherally located
mitochondria of the muscle fiber react differently to the load and are dis-
tinguished from the interfibrillar by a number of morphological and biochemical
properties. The work of N. D. 02ernyuk (1978) has shown that the mitochondria
of the peripheral zone of oocytes are more differentiated because of the inten-
sive influx of oxygen from the oocyte surface. According to the studies of L. A.
Kopteva et a1. (1972). in the myocardium the variously localized mitochondria

are distinguished by the rate of oxygen absorption, inclusion of labeled amino
acids, and functional activity.

By the third day of development of the irradiated chicks. the morphometric para-
meters of the peripheral mitochondria approach the control values. The quanti-

tative data of the myons of irradiated chick embryos diminish in the central site-
chondria. This is associated either with the disrupted consumption or supply of
interfibrillar mitochondria with oxygen. or change in the enzyme systems of the
mitochondria. Deterioration in the intracellular bioenergetic processes results
in fatty regeneration of part of the myons. 'l'he damaging effect of microwaves on
oxygen consumption by the tissues is shown in the work of P. S. Neelakantaswany
(I978). Changes were not noted in the properties of the mitochondria themselves
during irradiation. A special study of the espiratory control in isolated
irradiated mitochondria with PFD of 10 mH/cm did not reveal a disorder in

oxidizing phosphorylation [F.lder. J. A. and Ali. J. 3.. 1975].

Thus. the compensatory-adaptive response to SHF-irradiation includes reactions

that occur on different structural levels of muscle organization: intrace11u1ar,
cellular-tissue and organ. In this case, the interaction and interrelationship

of cellular and cell-tissue processes are traced, as well as the vascular and
nerve components of the muscle organ.

t0? detected by us ll-ﬁ7. This work is a continuation of the study of the nature
of changes in cell passages of aitotic cycle periods ensuing under various regimes
of the effect of an industrial-frequency electromagnetic field with 50 kV/mvoltage.

Material and methods. Initially trypsinized cultures of eubryonal fibroblast-like
human cells grown on cover glass by the standard method served as the object of
investigation. Culture tubes were placed in an industrial-frequency slectronag-
netic field. The latter was created between the plates of a condenser placed in
a thermostatically controlled charber. Ha-thymidine of specific activity of 4.3
k/mnol in the dose of l uCi per ml of nutrient medium was introduced into the cul-
ture medium. On completion of incubation the preparations were fixed, covered
with liquid emulsion of the P or H type. exposed at 4°C. developed with an amidol
developer and stained with Mayer's hemtoxylin. The index of labeled nuclei was
determined at the count of 1,000 cells and the nutter of granules of reduced sil-
ver, above 100 nuclei. The results obtained were subjected to statistical proc-

essing on the Mir-l computer.

Results of investigations and their discussion. The index of labeled nuclei, in-
tensity of DNA synthesis and length of S and G periods were determined as the
criteria of evaluation of the speed of cell passage of mitotic cycle periods. In
all, six series of experiments on 62 cultures were set up. The time of onset of
changes under the effect of an industrial-frequency electromagnetic field with 50
kV/In voltage was determined in the first series. For this purpose H’-thyuidina

100

was introduced into the culture medium. culture tubes were placed in the field and
after 0.5, 3, 6, 12 and 26 hours the index of labeled nuclei was determined in the
experiment and control. Investigations have shown (table 1) that 3 hours after the
beginning of the effect there is a reduction in the speed of rise in the index of

labeled nuclei. However, only at the end of the 24-hour period of effect the dif-

ferences between the experiment and control reach a statistically significant lev-
el (P<0.001).

Apparently, this points to the existence of a certain dependence between the Inni-
festation of changes and the length of the field's effect.

The subsequent series of experiments were devoted to a verification of this as-

sumption. ‘lhe possibility of observing the reversibility of the ensuing changes
and the speed of reducing reactions was also clarified.

Thirty minutes after a 5-hour period of stay of cultures in the field (the second
series of experiments) the number of labeled nuclei in the experiment is bigger
than in control (2a.6 and 19.12 respectively. P<0.001). Subsequently the nunber
of cells entering into the period of DNA synthesis increases at a lower speed in
the experiment and after 20 hours the index of labeled nuclei does not differ in
the experiment and control (table 2).

Thirty minutes after a 48-hour effect of an industrial-frequency electromagnetic
field the index of labeled nuclei is 27.31 lower in the experiment than in con-
trol (P<0.001), that is. with an increase in the time of stay of cultures in the
field the unnifestation of changes rises. However. the ensuing changes are rever-
sible and 3 hours after the cessation of irradiation the differences between the
experiment and control become statistically insignificant (P>0.05) (table 3).

At the same time. as shown earlier /_lo_/, after a 96-hour effect of an industrial-
frequency electromagnetic field the mitotic activity of cultures increases. Ap-
parently, such an increase in mitotic activity in cultures during their long stay
in the field is not due to the stimlation of cell passages of mitotic cycle
phases. but is connected with the transitionofpart of the cells from the cz-period
to mitosis in connection with the removal of contact inhibition during the death
of cells.

The slowing dean of cell passage of mitotic cycle phases in response to the dam-
aging effect of certain factors can be not only the consequence of a block of cell
transition from one cycle phase to another (as, for example, under the effect of
colchicine). but is also the result of prolongation of some phases as a result of
the inhibition of metabolic processes in the cell. In order to detect the char-
acteristics of the effect of an industrial-frequency electromagnetic field on the
mitotic cycle of cultivated human cells, we determined the length of the s and G;
periods. as well as the intensity of inclusion of H'-thymidine in the nuclei of
culture cells subjected to the field's effect. Since Quastler's equation is not
applicable for systems in which the number of cells entering into a certain mitot-
ic cycle period is not constant. the length of the S period was determined by a
saturation curve analysis according to the following formula:

I-!

I. = 7737. I5]-

The length of the 8 period calculated in this way was 11.2 hours in control and
6.8 hours in the experiment.

It was not possible to determine the nature of changes in the length of the G:
period under the effect of an industrial-frequency electromgnetic field owing to
its great variability in individual cultures. Both in the experiment and in con-
trol labeled mitoses appeared after 5 to 24 hours.

'lhe intensity of DNA synthesis was judged by the amber of grains of reduced sil-
ver over cell nuclei in the experiment and control. Cultures subjected to the ef-
fect of an industrial-frequency electromagnetic field contain sore nuclei with a
greater nuuber of grains as cowared with control, which can point to an accelera-
tion by the field of the speed of inclusion of H’-thymidine during DRA synthesis.

Conclusions. mus, under the effect of an industrial-frequency electrongnetic
field cell passage of mitotic cycle periods is disturbed in cultures of fibroblast-
like cells of human embryos. The disturbances are not connected with a block of

the transition of one phase into another. but are due to the prolongation of in-
dividual periods of the cycle. in particular the 5 period, owing to the field's
effect on metabolic processes in cells.

monograph (1) discusses this subject in detail. Consequently the original
interpretation V. Ye. Zhvirblis proposed for the phenomen\ he observed seems to us
to be indisputable. The principal difference between our positions is that
according to V. Ye. Zhvirblis' interpretation. an external factor influences the
symmetry of the polarimeter. i.e.. the apparatus. disturbing it. here. the role
of man is reduced to merely ascertaining this fact. Our data on the nephelometer
without the use of polarized light indicates. rather. that the receiver of
exogenous disturbances is. in fact. man and not the apparatus. The fact that the
effects described by V. Ye. Zhvirblis are easily demonstrated on simple
polarimeters only when operated at maximum transmission. but that precision
polarimeters (with reading accuracy of up to +0.0001 degree) are required in order
to observe them at minimum transmission. has a simple explanation if we assume
that the culprit for the described effects is not the apparatus but the human
operator. For this. it is natural to assume in working with the polarimeter that
when the Nicol prisms are parallel. the accuracy of reading the angle of rotation
of the apparatus dial proves to be higher than the threshold of sensitivity for
the human visual analyzer. Accordingly when the dial is rotated within a certain
range close to the maximum transmission of the polarimeter the difference in the
brightness of adjacent visual fields is not visually perceptible. In essence. the
method used by V. Ye. Zhvirblis is extremely close to the one we used in this
study and to the method of determining human sensory sensitivity. This method.
which is well known in psychology. was developed more than 100 years ago by
Fekhner and is known as the "standard deviation method." as one of three classical
psychophysical methods. It may be hoped that experiments investigating
correlations between fluctuations of sensory sensitivity and variation in the
intensity of penetrating geophysical factors will give further grounds for forming
opinions on the validity of correction of established concepts. The results of
the experiments of this sort conducted will be published.

[Text] This monograph sums up and analyzes extensive material from the literature,
as well as the authors' experimental data on the biological and biophysical effects
of electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range. The authors studied the
quantitative correlations between biological effects and radiation density, time
of exposure and type of biological object on different levels of organization-
cellular, systemic, organismic-in different species of animals-mice, rats and
dogs.

This book is intended for specialists concerned with radiobiology, aviation and
space medicine.

There are 6 tables, 69 illustrations; bibliography supplied on 29 pages.
Introduction

The intensive development of science and technology in the last 5-10 years has
resulted in a significant increase in number of various instruments and equipment,
which are the source of nonionizing electromagnetic radiation (EH3). In this
regard, the radiation burden on man increased and continues to grow. This applies
in particular to such fields as aviation and cosmonauics, where even now the
density of radiation output [power?] is sometimes many times higher than the
existing standards. The prospect of developaent, in particular, of radar techno.
logy, will be related to further increase in the radiation burden.

Nonionizing electromagnetic radiation has become one of the significant environ-
mental factors. Por this reason, it is logical for medical men, biologists and
engineering physicists to be very interested in studying the biological effects
of EHR, mechanisms of action, determination of permissible levels of exposure.
questions of dosimetry, etc.

The increased interest in this problem is indicated, in particular, by extensive
discussion thereof at the 6th International Congress on Radiation Protection in

France (Paris, April 1977), international symposiums on the effects of electro-

magnetic waves in the United States (Arly, October 1977) and Finland (Helsinki,

August 1978), and others.

In the last 10 years, many comprehensive surveys have been published (Petrov,
Subbota, 1966; Guy, Lehmann, 1976; Hichaelson, 1975), as well as monographs (Gordon,
1966; Presman, 1968; Petrov, 1970; Baranski, Czerski, 1976, and others), which

deal with analysis of experimental and clinical data on mechanisms of biological
effects of EHR, questions of setting standards, ways and means of protection
against radiation, etc., attention being focused chiefly on EHR in the radio-
frequency range.

Our objective here was to summarize and submit to critical analysis the existing
data in the literature of an experimental and clinical nature, concerning the
biological effects of EUR, as well as to discuss our own findings on the biological
effects of microwave EHR. He tried to find approaches and criteria that would
enable us to assess quantitatively and prognostically the main patterns of damage
to the organism.

In view of the fact that exposure to EMR during space flights is associated with
the set of various flight and space factors. in particular ionizing radiation, we
deemed it purposeful to discuss some theoretical aspects of the problem of the
combined effect of flight factors and specific experimental data concerning inter-
action between EHR and gamma rays.

Critical analysis of literature sources and our own research was made from the
standpoint of quantitative radiobiology, on the conception of "energy interaction"
between Elk and biological objects. We tried to examine the quantitative functions
between biological effects and density of radiation power, time of exposure and
type of biological object on different levels of organization-cellu1ar, organic,
systemic and organismic-in experiments on three species of animals (mice, rats and
dogs). We believe that this approach enabled us to make a conparative analysis of
the biological effects of nonionizing and ionising EHR.

While we adhere to the conception of "energy interaction" between EHR and biological
objects, we do not reject the possible "information interaction," formed in the
course of evolution. As we know, such interactions are characterized by transforma-
tion of information, transmission, coding and storage thereof. The biological
effects due to these interactions may not depend on the energy added to a given
system, but nature of information.

The first chapter of this book offers a brief description of the biophysical bases
of interaction between EHR and matter and, mainly, biological systems. The

second describes comparative analysis of biological effects of EUR in critical
systems of an organism--nervous, reproductive, visual and hemopoietic. The third
chapter describes and analyzes data on the lethal effects of EHR. Some patterns of
effects of EHR on the integral organism of mammals are discussed in the fourth
chapter. The fifth chapter describes some reactions of the neuroendocrine system,
mainly the adrenals. Finally, the last chapter of the monograph discusses the
biological effects of combined flight factors, including the results of studies of
biological interaction between microwave EHR and ionizing radiation. The book ends
with a conclusion and bibliography, which lists all works that the authors could
find on the subject through 1979.
