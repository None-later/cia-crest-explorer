PLO PLAN TO ENLISH BASE m JORDAN REVEALED
was“ London rue ossmn in august: 29 Nov 81 p 7
[Report by Colin Legun: "'PLO Plans Foothold in Jotdau'"]

[Text] A document has reached western capitals purporting to be a secret plan
under study by six leaders of the Palestine LiberationOrganization to re-
establish a foothold in Jordan from which to carry on the fight against Israel.

The docment reached neighbouring countries from Allen.

The need for a new independent base for Iilitary operations has become acute
because of Syria's hostility to the P10 leadership. especially Yasir 'Arafat
and the opposition they are encomtering in South Lebanon fron the Christian
militias. their Israeli allies and the Lebanese and Syrian authorities.

Due to the extremely sensitive nature of the plan. the document outlining the
new strategy is said to have been givm fcr study to just the six top leaders
who attended the secret conclave. It is said to have leaked out despite
extreme precautions. '

Those attending the neeting were Yasir 'Arafst; his deputy Salah Khalaf (also
known as Abu Iyad); Abu al-Halid, the head of the PLO's operational wing;

Abu el-llul. the chief of intelligence; Rani al-ﬁasan. 'Arafat's close confidant;
and Faruq Qadduni, head of the political departuent.

The purported plan examines at length the 'developnents in the Palestinian
revolution' since Black September 1970. when the PLO guerrillas were driven out
of Jordan by King Husayn. leaving than only Lebanon as a centre for military
operations.

After reviewing the advances achieved in the Arab world and the international
conunity since 1970. the document concludes that no real progress has been
nade towards fulfilling the PLO's main aim of liberating Palestine.

Analysing the reasons for failure, the purported plan emphasises the 'physical
separation' between the area of military operations in Lebanon and the main
concentrations of Palestinian popula ion in the Rest Bank and Gaza Strip.

POI omcm. USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

't attributes responsibility for this separation to 'the Syrian occupying forces,
the Lebanese Christians and their militias. and Israel's military intervention
in Lebanon.

The document concludes that Jordan is the only place from which it would be
possible to reach the Palestinians in the occupied territories and where the

PLO would be free from the military pressures of the Syrians and Christian
Lebanese.

It would also allow close contact with the Palestinians who asks up 50 percent
of'Jordan'e population. The document stresses that their passive support

could be converted into active cooperation through a PLO military presence
in Jordan.

The conclusion reached is that, unless the PLO military presence can be shifted
to Jordan, there will be no future for the Palestinian revolution.

What is needed, the document insists, is that the Palestinians should acquire
the same rights as they enjoy in Lebanon to establish autononous areas of
control, free from Jordanian interference. It goes on to discuss ways of getting
Jordanian acquiescence to allowing the PLO to return.

The document admits it will not be possible to get King Husayn's agreement to the
return. It will be necessary to conduct clandestine nationalist activity among
Palestinians in Jordan setting up 'revolutionary cells' which will serve as

the bridge over which the Palestinian revolution will march back into Jordan.

GULF DIPWATS mm on HBDIA'I'IGI EFFORT
JN301351 London name in English 1306 6'41 30 Dec 81

[Excerpts] Bahrain, 30 Dec (ammo—Syria and Saudi Arabia have apparently
agreed on a sajor diplosatic drive to heal divisions in the Arab world following
Israels annexation of the occupied Syrian Golan heights, Gulf Arab diplomats
said today.

An understanding was reached last week by Syrian President Refit al-Asad and
Saudi Crown Prince Pahd and supported by other Gulf states which envisaged fresh
attempts to end the Gulf war and reconcile Syria and Iraq and Saudi Arabia and
Libya, the diplomats. who asked anynonity, said.

They said they were not confident of the outcoae because of the cosplexity of

the rifts and what they called sany negative factors combining against reconcilia-
tion. They were unable to give specifics of how the understanding would be
carried out.

But the diploaats said they expected other unidentified Arab countries and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) to join the efforts at ease stage.

Hr Asad, who ended a tour of Saudi Arabia and other states of the Arabian
Peninsula on Hondsy. was expected to try to persuade Islasic revolutionary
Iran. with which he has strong ties. to accept peaceful efforts to end its
lS-sonth-old war with Iraq, the diplosats said.

Syrian officials in Danascus said today a high-level Iranian delegation was
expected there tosorrow.

Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will at the ease tine approach Iraq on the possibility
of ending the fighting and restoring its relations with Syria. severed by
Baghdad at the start of the war over alleged Syrian support for Irans war effort,
the diplonats said.

Relieving Iraq of the war burden and nornalising its ties with Syria are

regarded as essential to enable the Arabs to present some sort of cohesive
front on Israels eastern border.

Hhile Iraq has been responsive to peace efforts by United Nations, non-aligned
and Islaaic mediators, Iran has rejected any notion of a ceasefire until after

Iraq had withdrawn all its troops fron Iranian territory captured in the first
weeks of the war, the diploaats said.

Relations between Syria and Iraq, both ruled by rival factions of the Ba'th

Party, had been at a low ebb even before the war, reflecting political and
ideological disagree-ants and deep nistrust.

The diplonats said Syria was also expected to work for noraalised relations
between Saudi Arabia and Libya. one of Damascus partners in the hardline Arab
steadfastness front.

The Syrian and Saudi leaders also agreed on the need to hold an Arab sun-it if
the Security Council failed to act against Israel, the diploaats said.

An Arab sunnit in Morocco last month collapsed because of conflict over the

Saudi peace plan. which was opposed by Syria and other radicals for its implied
recognition of Israel's right to exist.

mam EOONMC SITUATIW REVIEWED
Paris WES TROPICAUX 8T minimums in trench No 1882, ’0 Dec 81 pp 3215-3221

[Text] At a time when French-Algerian relations seem to be taking
a new turn and experiencing a revival, we are presenting a number of
essential elements of the economic situation in Algeria, as that
country endeavors to apply the new developnent strategy that guided
the conception of its 5-year plan for 1980-1986.

Based on area (2,381,000 square kilometers) , Algeria is the second largest country
on the African continent, after Sudan, and tenthtlargest in the world. Because of
an extremely high rate of demographic growth (3.2 percent), its population has
nearly doubled since independence, nubering almost 20 million inhabitants, over
half of which (57.5 percent) are under the age of 20 and heavily concentrated in
the northern region of the country, with nearly 90 percent of the national territory
constituted by Saharan zones.

Despite the problems posed by this strong population growth, Algeria has been able
to attain and maintain a particularly high rate of formation of fixed capital,
nainly thanks to massive investments which. from 10 percent of the gross national
production (GNP) during the first decade of independence, went as high as loo percent
of the GNP in recent years. These investments, essentially nade in the productive
sector (70 percent in 1980), have absorbed oil revenue (which nade up nine-tenths
of Algerian exports from 1970 to 1979 and about one-third of the GNP) and are at the
root of the foreign debt, service on which amounted to 21.7 percent of the value

of exports at the end of 1978. however, because of the increased cost of hydrocar-
bons in 1979, service on the debt dropped to about 20 percent at the end of 1981.

Algeria's development strategy was based on the establishment of a heavy industry,
financed by oil revenue, which rm to become the country's subsequent instrment of
development when hydrocarbons reserves would be exhausted. Actually, despite a"ten-
fold increase in investments between the first plan (1970-1973: 12 billion diners)
and the second (1976-1977: 129 billion diners), industrial production still repre-
sents only 10 percent of the GNP, while the share of agriculture is stagnant at

8 percent. Purthernore, it is income from gas that apparently must complete, then
replace, oil revenue in ensuring the continuity of the development of the Algerian
economy. The productivity of the industrial public sector has not lived up to

hopes. Some plants have reached only 60 percent and sometimes as little as 15 per-
cent of their capacity.

FOI1OFFKJALIIIIONLY

The perhaps excessive priority reserved for industrialization, criticized by certain
economists, and the adoption following independence of a foreign pattern of develop-
ment have imposed heavy sacrifices on the people, whose essential needs, particular-
1y in the area of health, housing and basic consumer needs, have been neglected.

Therefore, after two years of reflection and in keeping with the orientations de-
fined at the beginning of 1980 by the Central Committee of the PIN, the new 5-year
plan for the 1980-1984 period proposes to correct past errors and deviations,

gain control of the national production apparatus in order to improve productivity,
particularly through the decentralization of responsibilities at the level of pro-
duction units, give a new thrust to agriculture and make up for the lag in meeting
the basic needs of the people. The era of accelerated industrialization making
massive use of foreign assistance and peak technology seems to be coming to an end
in Algeria. The country must henceforth invest in keeping with its needs and means,
economize on its oil resources and rely more 0: its own resources, while the utili-
zation of foreign loans must remain limited. In 1978. Algeria was the third-ranking
net borrower of all Third World countries, following Brazil and Mexico. One of the
objectives of the 1980-1984 Plan is to reduce the weight of the debt to 15 percent
of the value of exports.

Algeria undertakes this new phase of its development with solid assets. Among the
poor countries, Algeria is a rich nation with a gross national product in 1980 of
154 billion diners (some 184 billion francs). In 1979. the per capital GNP was
$1,580 (Morocco: $740; Tunisia: $1,120) and it placed Algeria in a good position
among intermediate-income countries in World Bank classifications. Even if its
construction was onerous and even if errors were made, the public industrial sector
constitutes a platform for future development if Algeria does succeed, as it seems
to want to. in putting together a diversified industrial fabric of small and medium-
zie enterprises that should revive it and increase its wealth. Algeria has been
wise enough to tenaciously build one of the instruments that can guarantee future
generations of the country's economic independence and meet social needs, particu-
larly employment.

Retrosctively marking the beginning of the new 5-year plan, the year 1980 began

with the main reorientations of Algerian policy on the working and marketing of
hydrocarbons, industry and agriculture.

FOI:0I1!C1AI.USIINVLY
ﬁontﬂﬂﬂCJAllﬂﬂEONLY

The priority given "to the conservation and preservation of national strategic
reserves" led Algeria to make a voluntary lZ-percent reduction in crude oil produc-
tion in 1980. Nevertheless, the discovery of new deposits in 1980 increased petro-
leum reserves to 1,213,000,000 tons, which could guarantee production at the current
rate for 20 years.

Natural gas production is linked to its marketing and Algeria has come to prefer
halting deliveries of liquefied gas in certain cases, waiting for results from the
negotiations it has entered into with its main customers concerning prices, which
it wants to link to the price of crude (see MARCHES TROPICABX of 27 November,

p 3169). It has also put off construction of the LNG 3 liquefaction complex at
Arzew.

For the time being, the predosinance of the hydrocarbon sector in the Algerian

economy remains very marked, representing 32.3 percent of gross national production
for the 1976.1979 period (annual average) and 37.5 percent in 1980.

The agricultural sector remains the "poor cousin," despite an improvement in cli-
matic conditions. It contributed only 7.3 percent of the GNP in 1980, down from
the average for the 4 previous years.

Finally, the substantial investments made in the industrial sector did not prevent
a certain decline in its contribution to the GNP, which, from an average 10.6 per-
cent for the 1976-1979 period, dropped to 10.4 percent in 1980.

The 1980-1984 Plan aims to correct these imbalances. The volume of investments
will reach 400 billion diners, half for the cost of projects included before

startup of the plan and not yet completed. The essential objective - that is,
the implementation of actions that could meet the people's aspirations by about

1990 - will be achieved through a far-reaching transformation of the general
investment planning system, greater flexibility in and decentralization of the
management of the economy, the establishment of forms of organization that will
provide greater control of the production and marketing apparatus, maximum utilita-
tion of capacities and better organization of.work.

This plan provides for a real annual growth rate of 8.2 percent, higher than that

of the previous plan - 7.5 percent - although it had actually been only 6.2 per-
cent for the 1970-1976, 7.2 percent in 1979 and the low 6.5 percent in 1980, marking
a substantial improvement over the 1960's, when the average was 0.6 percent.

An important change compared with the past is expressed in the more vigorous rate
of the growth in consumption compared with-the growth in investments. Growth in

consumption will be 8.6 percent annually, compared with a little over 7 percent
for investments.

Inasmuch as the utilization of foreign borrowing has been limited to 50 billion

diners for the duration of the plan, plan financing must essentially come from
budget savings, estimated to total 200 billion diners during the period. Some

60 percent of resources will come from oil taxes and 38 percent from regular taxes,
as well as savings of enterprises and private parties.

At 1979 prices, import needs for the period of the plan are an estimated 270 billion
dinars, an annual growth rate of 6 percent.

Aithough it represents by far the main source of foreign exchange, Algerian oil car-
ries little weight in the international oil balance. Algerian production is not
over 2 percent of all world production, 4 percent of OPEC production and 6 percent
of Arab production, although Algeria has taken from its reserves the highest pro-
portion registered in the world, reaching 6 percent in 1979, compared with an aver-
age of 3 percent in Arab oil-producing countries and 1 percent in Norway and the

Crude oil production. which reached a ceiling of between 50 and 54 million tons
between 1976 and 1979 and which was deliberately reduced by 12 percent in 1980.
should experience a forced regression of some 25 percent in 1981 as a result of the

decrease in deductions fron foreign companies 'because of the-reduction in world
consumption but also the high cost of Algerian oil.

Brought down to $37.5 a barrel following the OPEC nseting of 29 October 1981, the

cost of Algerian crude is anong the highest in the world and Algeria must face the
conpetition of Nigerian crude and crude fron the North Sea. Nevertheless. bartering

(using oil to pay for all or part of the equipment or consumer good inports), the
generally predicted increase mounting to 3 percent of the price of crude annually
in real terns over the next decade, and the increase ih upgraded products in the
forn of condensates and refined 011. should largely conpensate for the reduction

in value of the production of crude.

Actually. it is gas and not oil that is the main energy resource of Algeria, whose
intense proven reserves. sons 3 trillion cubic hetero. represent 3.9 percent of
world reserves in 1981 and put Algeria in fourth place in the world, after the
Soviet Union, Iran and the United States.

Algeria produces two kindsnof gas: natural gas and gas combined with oil. but at
the present tine. Algeria reeells only the for-er. As for the latter. it is either

burned or used as an auxiliary neans for the extraction of oil.

Algerian gas production is still low (between 16 and 16 billion cubic meters a
year (1978-1980). It is estimated that it could reach 100 billion cubic neters in

1981.. providing Algeria with foreign exchange equivalent to its oil revenue.

If the country agreed to export unrefined gas in order to respond to the urgent
needs of the international market. it was on the condition that in the future, the

najor portion should 'be turned into liquid gas before export. However. Algeria now
has an excess liquefaction capacity. In August 1981, the national liquefied natural

10

gas production capacity has doubled, reaching 30 billion cubic meters, with the

startup of the latest three liquefaction lines at the GL 1 K unit in Skikde. how-
ever, three liquefaction programs vere abandoned this year (6L 3 2 at Arzew; GL 2 K
at Skikda; and GL 1 C at Issers).

Actually, 1981 like 1980 was a year of transition for Algerian authorities, a year
that should gradually lead to the equivalence of crude oil and gas prices. For
that purpose, Algeria has gone so far as to break several contracts with American
customers (Tenneco and El Paso, at 20.5 billion cubic meters a year). Sales con-
tracts that are currently operational were reduced from 16.8 to 6.3 billion cubic
meters.

SONATRAGH is turning back to Europe. The two partners ready to receive additional
quantities are France and Italy. However, in both cases. although the laying of the
Algerian-Italian gas pipeline and construction of the Hontoir terminal have just
been completed, negotiations begun on prices have turned out to be difficult.

Actually, the Algerians, who have invested heavily in vorking their gas, do not
intend to "sell it off" (see MARCHES TROPICAUX, 27 November, p 3,169, Algerian
position on the price of liquefied natural gas).

Industry

Industry is in second rank after energy in the Algerian economy. It concentrates
on heavy industries: iron and steel metallurgy, machinery, electronic and

11

petrochemical complexes. The objective of Algerian planners was to replace indus-
try for oil in the future as the main source of national revenue. But the results
have not been in proportion to the sums invested. ‘In 10 years, the industrial
sector absorbed 170 billion Algerian dinars, which were spent to set up plants that,
based on the quality of their equipment, were to vie with those in many industrial-
ized countries. Poor management and carelessness, joined with the control exercised
over then by foreign experts, reduced their capacity to 60 percent, 30 percent and
sometimes less. '

Consequently, the growth in investments in the industrial field was accompanied
by a considerable drop in production and, consequently, in production. In metal-

lurgy and iron and steel, production dropped by 27 percent between 1976 and 1978.

Lead production dropped much more than iron and steel production, dropping by 75
percent in 1978 compared with 1972. The same is true for zinc (down 62 percent).

Reading the industries with noteworthy progress are weaving, spinning and tanning.
As for the equipment industry (trucks, tractors, harvesters, and so on), part of

the production is still stored because it was not marketed to selfdmanaged proper-
ties and farm cooperatives under the agrarian revolution. By way of example, out of
200 trailer tractors already built, 176 were still in stock.

Actually, according to the objectives of the new 1980fl986 Plan, investments in
industry should increase moderately until they represent 38 percent of all invest-

ments, compared with 60 percent for the previous plan. New plans tend to strengthen
industries that can meet the urgent needs of the population and increase productiv-

ity.

Half of the expenditures provided for in the plan will be devoted to the completion
of projects underway (paper mills, cement works, petrochemistry) or already planned
(chemistry, mechanical industry). The other half will be allocated for the con-
struction of smaller and more concentrated units in the building materials sector
(iron and cement) and the durable consumer goods sector.

Nevertheless, of the investment program for 1981 (83.8 billion dinars), some
38 billion will be devoted to industry (45 percent). However, the 72 percent of the

industrial investments already ccsaﬂtted actually correspond to investments pre-
viously planned and not completed.

The share of the industrial sector in the GNP showed a slight decline in 1980é1981
to 10.5 percent, but processing industries rose 11 percent in 1980 comapared with
1979. This improvement corresponds to.a certain resurgence in productivity covering
25 percent of production capacity. The latter suffers in particular from difficul-
ties in receiving supplies of agricultural products due to the deterioration of the
agricultural sector.

By way of example: the Relizane agroindustrial unit, which represented an invest-
ment of 200 million dinars, went into production in 1975 with a processing capacity
of 15, 000 tons a year for five assembly lines (processing of oranges, tomato paste,
grape juice, processing and packing of olives and various vegetables). At the pre-
sent time, two lines are operating regularly, with the others being halted for lack
of supplies of the necessary agricultural products. The plant handled 4,588 tons

of farm products in 1980 (30 percent capacity), compared with 2,h90 tons in 1979

(16 percent of capacity).

In addition, the SONIC (National Cellulose Industries Company) alfalfa complex
produced 20,000 tons of paper pulp in 1980 (30 percent of the capacity of 66,000
tone), up 12.5 percent compared with 1979. This complex still suffers from agri-
cultural supply problems (alfalfa). Normally, 1t should receive 500 tons a day of

alfalfa, but it never received over 60 tons a day.
Building and Public Works

The building and public works sector (ST?) is of such importance in the Algerian
economy that it is the second employer after agriculture and in third place in the
structure of the GNP after services and industry. This sector now includes 6,236

enterprises, 5,500 of these in the private sector (86 percent employing fewer than
20 wage earners).

The instability of the private enterprises and the negligence of the public sector

have significantly emphasized the imbalances between production capacities and the
BTP demand induced by the high rate of investments, which engenders longer delays

in building and increased spending that is intolerable for the national economy.

All means of construction, whether it be a question of design or construction
capacity, national or local means, will require the injection of over 20 billion
diners in constant terms during the 1980-1984 period. In value, housing programs
will be five times higher than those included in the latest 6-year plan. Major
means will be granted to the private sector and do-it-yourself construction will
be encouraged, mainly in rural areas. By appealing to foreign builders, in keeping

l3

FOI4OFFKJALIENEONIY

with terms of intervention to be defined, the Algerian Government hopes to complete
construction of 100,000 housing units a year, compared with 25,000 at present
(see MARCBES TKDPICAUX, 16 October 1981, p 2616).~

Agricultural Sector

The agricultural sector represents only about 7 percent of the gross national pro-
duct, although it employs_over half of the population. Actually, it has been so
neglected by the government that the increase in agricultural products has not
exceeded 30 percent in 17 years, an average of 1.7 percent a year, while the popu-
lation dc:bled and the increase in-the cost of living tripled.

It should be noted that the per capita share of food products has gradually declined
over a period of more than a quarter century, dropping to half in the 1970's com-

pared with the 1950's, a drop that had to be made up for by imports. to 1979,
Algeria imported over one-third of its consumption of grain and milk, 80 percent of

its oil consumption and nearly half of its sugar consunption.

Algerian development plans have given-priority to the industrial se.tor at the ex-
pense of the agricultural sector, with the development of the former making it
possible to improve the products needed to develop the latter. That is why the farm
sector has begun to receive investments in the field of development only starting
with the second plan. however, it can be noted that credits made available to the
sector scarcely exceed 75 percent of the credits allocated by the plan.

This policy has resulted in a rural exodus toward the cities. Incapable of engaging
in industrial activities because of a lack of professional training in the technical

and technological fields, rural people join the army of the unemployed, thereby
worsening the social crisis and making the country even more dependent-on foreign

countries for food, whose prices have increased considerably. Nor have government
subsidies aimed at stabilizing the prices of basic products, in order to make them

accessible to the poor who make up the majority of the people, increased in the same
proportions. In 1981, the Algerian Government devoted 2.3 billion diners to sup-
porting the prices of these products (oil, sugar, flour, in particular).

The government has decided henceforth to grant top priority to agriculture. The
1980-1984 Plan doubles investments devoted to agriculture itself, compared with the
previous plan, and increases credits allocated to waterworks five times. The total
represents 11.7 percent of the investments planned during the period in question.

The farm policy tends to reintegrate the crop-livestock-forestry association in the
three climatic zones (steppes, high plains, coastal tell), combining irrigation and
dry farming so as to break with the traditional specialization. The plan provides
for continuing development of the soil, protection and expansion of the forestry
patrimony, development of sheep and cattle raising and development of orchards.
Sons 25,000 hectares of old farm areas will be renovated and 50,000 of new peri-
meters should be developed, in connection with the use of new dams and the drilling
of more wells.

Credits reserved for waterworks will make the construction_of a number of large
dams, including one at Oran, possible, but essentially, the creation of many small
reservoirs and systematic use of isolated water resources. A survey of resources

14

liﬂl‘ﬂlllClAl.lll£(ﬂ¥lY
FOR OIWWCJAI.IHNE(MVLY

will be made to permit the implerentation of medius- and long-term programs. The
upper plateaus and the semi-arid zones will receive priority in the development of
small and medium-size water projects.

Nevertheless, the plan provides for an average growth rate of only 4 percent sn-
nually, scarcely higher than the rate of population growth. As the plan states,
the result envisaged will require an improvement in production structures, parti-
cularly the cooperatives, true interest on the part of producers in short- and
medium-term results and a policy of encouraging young people to remain faithful to

agriculture by guaranteeing then social advancement in keeping with progress in
other activities and priority training for foreman and management posts.

As for the fight against food shortages, it will depend on better organization of
distribution, thereby eliminating speculation and hoarding that leads to waste and
preventing any increase in the food imports which weigh so heavily on the trade

balance. By way of example. wheat imports alone now represent the equivalent of
two months' oil exports.

At the present time, wheat, barley, grapes and dates head the list of Algeria's
agricultural products. While oil and gas constitute the essential basis of Algerian
economic development, dates are considered to be the cornerstone of the Saharan
economy. Their harvest, approaching 140,000 tons a year, actually places the coun-
try in sixth place in the world after Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
"heat production, which totaled an average 1,444,000 tons a year between 1970 and
1980, places it in third place among Arab producers after Morocco and Egypt, as

does barley production, after Morocco and Iraq.

Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments

(In the following section, certain apparent contradictions will be found between

the figures on the trade balance in the first table and those given later for the.
balance of payments. Actually, the first table, drawn up based on statistics from

the International Monetary Fund, uses exports at the F03 stage and imports at the
CIF stage, while the other table uses both imports and exports at only the P03
stage.)

Foreign Trade

The strategy followed for economic development in Algeria helped increase the share

of foreign trade in the gross national product and accentuate the dependency of
the Algerian economy on foreign countries. From 1974 to 1978, the value of Algerian

imports exceeded half of the GNP, while exports represented only one-third.

This situation is naturally reflected in the trade balance, which has shown a con-

stant deficit except for 1974, when the trade surplus was due to a partial recovery
of the real value of oil. In 1974, it had remained under the 1958 level despite

the strong increase in oil prices. In 1979, despite the increase in price for Al-
gerian oil amounting to 46 percent and the restriction on imports (down 1.5 percent),

Algeria's trade balance still showed a deficit (- $313 million).

The trade deficit that marked the last decade in a constant manner, except for 1974,
can be attributed to two factors:

15

ilﬂl(lﬂﬂ(1Al.lEﬂ!(HVLY
ROI OFINCIAI.IIHE(NULY

l - an inport demand that has increased to the point of far exceeding the level
required by the real rate of growth in revenue, whence an increased demand for
finished and semi-finished products (representing 22 percent of all imports), whose
value in 1978 quadrupled compared with 1973, although local products had been ex-
pected to take their place.

2 -- an exorbitant increase in inport prices, first of all for equipment (making up
40 percent of the total), whose value in 1978 more than quadrupled compared with
1973 for a substantially lower quantity, and for food (representing 30 percent of
the total). The increase in import prices is attributable to the worsening of
inflation in industrialized countries, the depreciation of the dollar, a gauge of
the value of imports, and the readjusteent by industrialized nations of the prices
of their exports to developing countries, including oil-producing countries, in
terms of the higher prices for oil in 1974.

Consequently, the trade deficit experienced a strong increase in 1975 (totaling
$1,318,000,000), nearly quedrupling compared with the 1971 figure, while in 1974
the balance showed a surplus for the first time. What further worsened it was the
tension in trading relations between Algeria and France in 1975, with which the
trade deficit amounted to $1 billion, while it did not exceed $240 million in 1974.
(France actually greatly restricted its imports from Algeria, although Algeria did
not do the same. Consequently, total Algerian exports did not increase at all,
while the overall value of imports increased 41 percent over the preceding year.)

During the same decade, the trade deficit reached its second record figure in 1978

($2.335,000,000), when it nearly doubled compared with 1975. This is due to a
worsening of the world economic crisis during a year when oil prices tended to

dwindle with the drop of the dollar. Consequently, Algerian exports showed a
small increase (up 7 percent over 1977), while the value of imports continued to

rise (up 21 percent over 1977), despite the policy adopted by Algeria aimed at re-
stricting the importation of products not considered basic.

The trend was reversed in 1980, when the Algerian trade balance registered a record
surplus of $1,696,000,000 (nearly quadruple the 1974 figure) due to the increase in
oil prices (up 23 percent). Rising Algerian exports (up 51 percent) reached a

16

FOR10FFKJAL.USB(MVLY

record of $12.4 billion, compared with $10.7 billion for imports (up 25.9 percent).
In 1981. the reduction by several companies -— essentially American -— of their
collections of Algerian oil, from 10 to 20 percent, due to the pressures of excess
Saudi production sold at an exceptionally low prices had strong repercussions on
African exports. Algeriafs sales reportedly dropped in volume by one-fourth com-
pared with 1980.

Despite the reduction in oil sales, it is estimated that the 1981 trade balance
will still show a surplus of $1.7 billion, due to the estimated 6.5-percent drop

in value of imports, compared with 5.7 percent for exports. '

Structure of Exports

Algeria's dependency on its oil has increased in recent years. 011 deliveries
actually constituted 92 percent of all exports for the 1974-1980 period, compared
with 88 percent in 1972. As for the rest, the already small portion has declined
even further: For example, manufactured products dropped from 6-percent in 1972 to
2 percent in 1978, while exports of food products,which represented 3 percent in
1972, became almost negligible in 1978.

In fact, the lack of diversification of Algerian exports is one of the major prob-

lems posed by the single-product economies of-Third World countries in general.
including oil-producing countries. And yet, the efforts Algeria has made and the

’-

suns it has spent on the industrial sector in order to be able, once freed froa its
dependency on a single product, to obtain foreign exchange by substituting manufac-
tured products for oil, have had no equal in any other country, even anong those
that produce oil. Nevertheless, Algeria is doomed to export its oil and gas for a
long time to cone.

Algeria's Principal Trading Partners

For France, Algeria is a particularly important trading partner. It is in fact its
front-ranking African customer, as well as its main custo-er among Arab countries
and its prime custoner among Third Horld countries, surpassed for purchases of
French products only by the BBC, the United States and Spain. Algeria's imports

of French products and equipment represented 35 percent of all Algerian iaports.
This share remained at about 25 percent in 1979 and 1980, despite Algeria's desire
to diversify its connercial trade. Mechanical industries retain a preponderant
place (50 percent) among Preach exports to Algeria. In 1981, it became the third-
ranking custoler of the machine and metal processing industries with, for the

first six months, 6.03 percent of French exports from the sector. It occupied only
fifth place with 5.04 percent in 1980. This progression is explained by the
choices of orientation of the 1980-1984 Plan.

The essential portion of French imports from Algeria is sade up of crude oil,
natural gas and refined petroleum products. Out of a production of 47.2 million

tons of oil in 1980, the share of the French oil companies was 10.4 million tons.
For natural gas, French imports experienced quantitative fluctuations in 1980 as a

result of the nearly total halt in deliveries from Skikda between March and July.
Nevertheless, gas imports held steady in value last year. Gas deliveries increased

18

FOI<0511C1AI.1EH!(HVLY

substantially at the beginning of 1981 (up 168.9 percent between the imports for the
first half of 1980 and those of the first half of 1981).

For oil, Algeria went from third p1ace among France's eupp1iers in 1976 to fourth
place in 1977 and fifth place in 1978, behind Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Nigeria and the

Emirates. 0n the other hand, in 1980, Algeria was the third supplier of natural
gas to France after the Netherlands and the Soviet Union.

Overall commercial trade between France and Algeria in 1980 totaled 18.5 billion
French francs. According to figures available for the first nine months of 1981,
it should reach and even exceed 20 billion francs for the entire year.

The deficit in the trade balance with France has steadily grown since 1973 and it is
a constant concern of Algeria to restore the balance in its trade. Nevertheless,
the trend seems to have reversed during the months of July and August 1981, during
which the value of Algerian imports dropped 30 percent compared with the average

for the preceding months, while the value of Algerian exports to France shot up

(+ 72 percent). The result, for the two months considered and for the first time

in the history of French-Algerian trade relations since 1973, is a surplus in favor
of Algeria estimated at some $150 million.

Among Algeria's other trading partners, the top-ranking ones are the United States,
the prime customer for oil (and whose balance gave a surplus in 1978 of 10 billion
diners). the Federal Republic of Germany (whose sales to Algeria have remained
stable for 3 years at 6 billion francs and represent lb.6 percent of Algerian in-
ports), Italy (13.5 percent), Belgium (13 percent) and Japan. which could make a
spectacular entry on the Algerian market after the development of large Japanese
equipment contracts paid for in oil. In fact, the overall amount of commercial
trade between the two countries, at a low point 10 years ago, increased considerably

at the end of the decade and at the end of 1981, doubled the 1980 amount, which was
40 times the 1971 total! Japan's acceptance of compensation contracts expresses its

desire for long-tern cooperation with Algeria.

Balance of Payments

Hhile the (FOB) trade balance showed a surplus two or more times during the 1970's.
the balance of invisibles has always shown a serious deficit. That deficit has
grown alarmingly worse in recent years. increasng 13 times and over in 1980 com-
pared with 1972 ($5,103,000.000. compared with $328 million). This is mainly due to
an increase in service on the foreign debt (interest and repayment of loans) equi-
valent, on the average. to half of the total imported services (over $6.3 billion
in 1979, compared with $621 million in 1972): transport costs. insurance, transfer
of revenue for foreign investments and other invisibles, which also increased in the
same proportion.

The effect carried over to the balance of current operations. which showed a contin-
uous deficit. except in 1976. The deficit has therefore grown worse in recent years
to the point of a total of 83.539.000.000 in 1978. compared with $126 million in

1972. Nevertheless, the surpluses registered by the trade balance in 1979 (total of
31.688.000.000) and 1980 ($6.07 billion). compared with a deficit of $953 million

in 1978, have helped reduce the deficit in the balance of current operations to
31.718.000.000 in 1979 and $663 million in 1980, despite the worsening of the deficit
in the balance of services.

It is estimated that maintaining the surplus in the 1981 balance of payments would
once again make the situation of the balance of current operations and the balance
of payments less erratic. Foreign reserves dropped slightly in August (down 3 per-
cent compared with 1980), corresponding to three aonths of imports, or the sane
level as the previous year.

Foreign Debt

Algeria has undertaken to balance the growing deficit in the balance of current
operations through foreign loans, whose amount was $3,652,000.000 in 1978 and
52.727.000.000 in 1980 (compared with $200 million in 1972), thanks to which it
was able to cover the entire deficit mentioned. Its balance of payments showed a
surplus of $92 million in 1978 and $495 million in 1979, compared with a deficit of
$348 million in 1977.

At the sane time, foreign loans helped consolidate foreign exchange dreserves,
totaling $3,773,000,000 in 1980 (compared with $285 million in 1972), an amount that
willgo to pay for imports for a period of 3 Ionths.

* Including undistributed debt.

It is thought that in 1979, Algeria paid back $2,687,000,000 as service on the for-
eign debt, or 25.6 percent of the value of exports, compared with 9 percent in 1975.

FOR OIIICIAI.USEdﬂVLY
FOR OFFICJAI.UE€40NIN

According to the preceding table, one can see that the foreign debt in 1979 exceeded
23.3 billion, of which $15.3 billion were actually drawn off. The rate of increase
rose nearly tenfold compared with 1972. But Algeria, which resorted to foreign
loans to pay back its previous debts, has contracted for no new loan on the-finan-

cial markets for 2 years. Service on its foreign debt could therefore fall to
20 percent of Algerian exports in 1981, compared with 25.6 percent in 1979.

The FIN weekly, REVOLUTION AFRICAINE, carried an article 2 years ago strongly con-
demning the excessive dependency of the Algerian economy on other countries, which
had"gainedcontrol of the strategic sectors of the national economy through loans,

studies, construction, the supplying of equipment, technical assistance and-the ex-
port market."

As expressed in the plan, the policy of the new authorities is ained at restoring
a balance and better responding to the social needs of the population and manifestly
intends to break that domination.

HIRE FLEXIBILITY SEEN IN POLICY on BBRBBR LANGUAGE. CULTURE
Paris HARCHBS TROPICMIX ET MBDITERRANBBNS in French No 1882, lo Dec 81 p 3223

[Text] Latent for nany years, then suddenly exposed in the spring of 1980 by the
disturbances in 'l‘izi-Ouzou, the problem posed by the insertion of Berber culture
and traditions into a centralized, Arabic Algeriahas in recent months constituted
one of the major concerns of the government in Algiers. Following lengthy reflec-
tion and deliberations, the question would appear to be on the way to a relatively
liberal resolution, albeit within a unitarian, Arabic perspective.

For several months, a liberal orientation has been fecal-landed by a number of ad-
visers to President Chadli Bendjedid, particularly by Dr Ahmed Taleb Ibrahini. In

a report submitted at the beginning of this year, Taleb states that "dialects must
not be pitted against the national language, nor does the national language need
dialects to disappear in order to develop." The son and spiritual heir of an illus-
trious reformist doctor and comrade of Abdulhamid hen Bsdis, Shaykh Bachir Ibrahini.
Taleb also shows his attachment to Arab and Islanic values in this docummt: "It is.

cosmopolitsnisa that threatens the national culture," he writes. "not the people's
cultures."

Taleb's article was published on 25 March under the pseudonym of Ibn al Hakim, in a
supplement to the daily EL MOUNABID. However, it seems scarcely to have influenced
the authors of the very copious "rm Report on Cultural Policy" (about 15,000 words).
which, at the end of June-beginning of July, served as a basis for the work of the
Central Comittee and was adopted by it. This document made only a very brief
reference to the historic role of the "Berber princes" previous to Isles and the
"mingling of Arabs and Berbers," described as giving birth to a society whose civil- *
ization is "of Islamic essence, Arabic speaking and humanist in vocation."

After deploring "the extreme insufficiency of cultural production in all its forms ,"

the "FLN Report" reports that the national culture should develop in "three strate-
gic directions":

1) “working toward the establishnent of the cultural identity of the people...

through an overall view of the genesis of its civilization..., a strengthening of
its Arab-Islamic entity..., the utilization of its patrimony in its positive as-
pects and in the service of its unity...";

Z) "vigorously working to build a socialist society through the formation of an
n,

enlightened spirit... , and

23

”WWW!”
FOIOFI’ICIALIBEONLY

3) "being open to the values of our time and cousitted to the defense of human
causes," with a creation of awareness of the importance of unified action "at the
level of the Arab Haghreb and Arab unity," and so on.
Naturally, "in their interaction with the national culture, the people's languages
and cultures" are among the half-dozen multiple and additional aspects of this
culture enumerated by way of example. But mch greater importance is attached to
"the (Arab) language in its continuation and evolution" and to "the (Isl-1c)
religion in its unifying nature and specific characteristics throughout history,"
for "Islam's penetration into the heart of the Berbers, their adoption of Arabic
in religious practice and the express of thought have reached such an"extent that
the Haghrebian peoples. including the Algerians. have taken it upon themselves

to propagate Islam and spread Arabic," which would possibly take the place of
governments.

At the present time, the masses "refuse to view the generalization (of Arabic) as
any attack on local dialects... of which it is the source, if not the catalyst."

Finally, it is recalled that “the cultural patrimony, with its genres and diverse
types" is among "the bases of the national culture" and that the forms of expression
in the different dialects, privileged means of gaining access to the treasuries of
popular tradition, should feed the search for an effective language and style.
However, it is emphasized in conclusion that "the interaction of the Arabic language
with the people's literatures and arts in the different dialects gives this-language
the task...of making this people's tradition known throughout the Arab world, by
enhancing it."

People's Literatures and Dialects Taught in Four Universities

This concept of a people's tradition that is undoubtedly recognised, but destined
to be “enhanced" and disseminated by the Arabic language could not fail to worry
the Berber culture zealots. Consequently, by the middle of September, a "Movement
for Berber and Democracy" launched a protest against the "antidemocrstic and segre-
gationist policy of the government," and issued an appeal for a general 26-hour
strike in Kabyle for 28 September.

If the appeal fell on empty cars, it was undoubtedly because, in his televised
interview of 26 September, the minister of higher education took the initiative and
stated: "It is not the objective" of the national language. he said, ”to crush

the people's heritage, but on the contrary, to enrich it." Therefore, in the pro-
graas of the four major universities in Algiers, Annaba, Qecentina (Constantine) and
Hahran (Oran), "there will be instruction in the people's cultural heritage, in its

different component parts,"ona required or optional basis. A working group set up
in July is putting together the courses, the minister added, courses that will

include, for example, “the morphology and syntax of spoken Arabic, compared Arabic
dialects of the Maghreb, traditional Algerian arts. Berber linguistic structures,

Berber phonology and morphology compared, ancient, contemporary and Berber Algerian
oral literature." '

In addition, research in these smae subjects will be organised in the form of

areas of study for the master's degree (for example: cultural sociology, Haghrebian
literature) and research groups organized by the National Office for Scientific

Research (ONES) .

“WIMONIX
MWMONLY

These provisions probably do not entirely satisfy the backers of the Kabyle demands.
The reform does in fact remain clearly centralized: There was no local consultation,

teaching and research will remain the monopoly of the university and the ONES, and
only the "major universities" — therefore excluding Tizi-Ouzou — will be included.

The leaders of the Movement for Berber and Democracy therefore felt obliged to
continue their strike appeal. They alleged the continuation of the imprisonment,
for the past 5 months, of members of the University of Algi-rs cultural group and
brought up the exclusion of lycee students in Bejaia and Tiai-Quou, as well as the

"Laying off of workers sympathizing" with their movement. Except. in a few schools,
the appeal went mannered. 0n the whole, the Kabyle population thought another

day of protest, analogous to those of 16 April 1980 and 15 March 1981, was useless.
The people had the feeling that the government authorities, while remaining intransi-
gent about maintaining public order, had reversed their linguistic position in giv-

ing up the idea of outlawing the Kabyle talks and in even manifesting a certain
interest in Berber popular traditions.

And yet, as for any other reform, it is the application that will be the essential
thing. Hill the major universities and the ONRS hasten to launch education and re-
search in that vast and confusing domain of traditions and dialects? Will this

cultural policy go so far as the detacl'ment, in Kabylia itself, of study organs?
will the desire for a relaxation of tension lead to a rapid glossing over of past
incidents and the release of those responsible? If such is not the case, a resump-
tion of agitation in Berber regions in the fairly near future could be feared.

FUNDAMENTALIST VIOLENCE, PENAL CODE, PBRSODIAL STATUS W DISCUSSED
Paris HARCHBS TROPICAUX B‘l‘ HBDITBWS in French No 1882, 6 Dec 81 pp 3222-3224

[Text] In Algeria, as in most Muslim countries, sons of the young people, eainly
students, have been won over by the Islamic fundamentalist propaganda put out by
the mslim brotherhoods and members of similar associations working underground.
A few years ago, following a umber of incidents, authorities reacted to the

Al Kiran (Values) association, which, on the pretext of defending morals, took it
upon itself to iepose a sometimes brutal censor's role in certain university
schools. Since the beginning of last year. one could observe — especially in the
universities of Algiers and Oran - a renewed outbreak of activity on the part of
fundamentalist students. Invoking the need to defend and spread Arab-Islamic
civilization and its moral values, they use violence, either against those of their
comrades who profess liberal ideas or defend Kabyle claims, or egath peaceful
students who use western dress. However, authorities seem to have systematically
minimized these facts and to have closed their eyes, perhaps because the Islamic

activists were at the same time the most zealous propagandists of the policy of
Arahizetion.

Laghouat Affair

A death had to occur -- in this,csse, that of a public order official — before
authorities reacted and resolved to take drastic action. On I October, Minister
of Religious Affairs Abderrahmane Chibane told the Islamic high Council and the
upper-level personnel in his ministry of a bloody incident that had taken place a
few days earlier in Laghouat and during which a public order official had been
killed when he tried to arrest a fundamentalist who was creating a disturbance.
In the days that followed, the Algerian press published a detailed account of the
event, along with the deliberations and resolutions of the Islamic nigh Council.

Among other things, the Laghouat fundamentalists wanted to urge fellow citizens to
eat only dates and milk and to go barefoot. After driving out the official priest,
they took it upon themselves to impose an imam as prayer director. As their leader,
a physics professor and deserter from the National Service, had been arrested, the
funduentalists took refuge in the mosque, which they occupied and from which they
incited local disturbances for a long the.

Without using force, police tried to gain access to the mosque. They were greeted
from blows from iron bars and daggers. They nevertheless managed to disperse the

demonstrators, but one of the officers was stabged in the back as he questioned one
of the authors of the violence.

26

MWWMY
IIIICIWNCJAI.US£<DNIN

The members of the Islamic High Council and the upper-level personnel in the min-
istry passed a motion denouncing "these ignorant adventurers who pursue suspicious
designs contrary to our religious faith, the interest of Algeria and that of the
Islamic nation...(and) these types of behavior resulting from a mistaken understand-
ing of Islam." They demand' 'an end to any anarchic action within the places of

Allah" and recommend that preachers and priests "intensify their efforts to educate
in order to bar the way to the ignorant."

Incidents Near Algiers

In the weeks that followed, the press devoted large amounts of space to other vio-
lent, but less serious, incidents caused in the Algiers suburb by fundamentalists:
punitive action taken against an El Hadania family suspected of having hired a
singer for a marriage ceremony who was not sufficiently respectful of Muslim mores;

throwing acid at and bludgeoning girls wearing western dress, this for the 12th
time in El Barrach. On this occasion, several similar incidents in the past
4 years would be recalled.

The authors of the El Hadania violence were acquitted. The judge noted that "the
witnesses are afraid of them and dare not tell the truth." At the request of the
Ministry of Justice, they were tried once again and sentenced to prison. The chief
magistrate, Hrs Aslaoui, told then: "Your so-called 'religious' motives mask your
determination to violate public order. They have no connection with Islam....
Islam is the state religion. One must not claim to make a distinction between Hus-
lims and non-Muslims among the faithful."

According to the press, "the trial brought out the danger of the rapid growth of a
phenomenon, in which fundamentalism and crime are mixed, in sections of the capital
where groups are forms to act in the name of Islam and wage 'thair purification'
campaign" (EL HOUDJAHID, 28 October).

Penal Code and Conception of Islam

In November, the National Assembly examined various bills, amendments to the Penal
Code and the drafting of a Personal Status Code that would question, fairly dir-

ectly, the conception that the citizens of Algeria might have of the rogulations
of Islam.

The partial reform of the Penal Code particularly concerns the rights and freedoms
of citizens and the protection of society. It has given rise to interesting posi-
tions on sanctions and the death penalty. Different members of the Assembly have
stated, for example, that the death penalty should have been applied either to

those who recruit mercenaries for a foreign power or to those who profane the na-
tional flag.

However, Deputy Belayat caused a sensation in proposing a ban on the death penalty,

which in his opinion shows "an obvious lack of civilization" and on life imprison-
ment, inasmuch as "only God can tell a man that he must spend the rest of his life

in such a situation" and rehabilitation of the guilty party must never be systema-
tically excluded. "Islam does not forbid the death penalty," Belayat states, "but

it does not require its application. we must give a positive and humanitarian

interpretation to this religion, which seeks the redemption rather than the destruc-
tion of man."

FOIIOFFﬂJAI.USE(MVLY

Commenting on one article in the bill, which excludes the application of life in-
prisonment to women, Minister of Justice Bouslem Beki states that the government was
faced with a choice: "Either respond to the watchword of the emancipation of women
and their legal equality with man, and therefore punish them in the same way, or
protect them as the Prophet urged." More generally. Saki felt that to preach out-

rageous punishments would be to compromise the fairness of the Code: "Our conduct
must be dictated by clemency," he said.

Proposed Personal Status Bill

0n h October. the government presented a personal status bill to the Bureau of the
National Assembly, a bill aimed at filling one of the last great gaps remaining in
Algerian legislation. Aware of the difficulty of the subject, often debated in
public and always giving rise to strong conservative positions, the Bureau entrusted
study of the text to a coordinating committee made up of magistrates and university
professors. In setting up such a_body, Assembly President Rabah Bitat said: "The
bill must be in keeping with our religion and our national traditions...(and) also
adapted to currently existing social conditions and the socialist society that we
want to build."

Five women deputies are on the committee. Nevertheless, some 100 teachers, students
and employees or civil servants demonstrated before the Assembly on 28 October to
demand that "women be included in the study of the bill, ramk-and-file debate and

in informing the public.“ Petitions have been circulated in the country and have
gathered many signatures.

Examination of the bill by the Assembly began on 9 November. On 16 November. a
group formed by students belonging to the National Union of Algerian Youth organized
a demonstration of 200 to 300 women headed by Mrs Rabah Bitat, heroine of the r13,
who came out of her customary reserve for the occasion. A delegation, received by
the Assembly, asked that the bill be the subject of a rank-and-file discussion.

The demonstrators then approached the National Union of Algerian Women (tYFA), which
was holding its National Council. Several members of the Union suggested that the
parliamentary debate be adjourned so that their organization would have the time to
formulate proposals. It does in fact seem surprising that UNPA has not been brought
into the drafting of the bill. Not prohibited by law, this procedure would perhaps
have been timely.

The Defense Companies make up a sectarian army that is

It is possible to have a Lebanese solution apart from the

understanding and the Arabs do not interfere.

On Egypt: Hubarak should consider what happened to
al-Sadat. and he should exercise deliberation on both

the Arab and international scenes.

we want peace based on principles that would guarantee
our interests and our sovereignty; prolonging the war may
cause the disintegration of Iran.

The war did indeed restrict some of our Arab capabilites.
but it did not force us to nuke compromises.

The Arabs should tell us what they believe is wrong

in our policy. and they should encourage us when they
believe we are doing what is right.

Al-Sadat died the day he visited Jerusalem; he was buried
the day he signed the Camp David Agreement; and he found
no one to come to his rescue when he was shot.

We cannot believe that the United States did not know

of Israel's intention to bomb our nuclear installations.

We want Lebanon to be sovereign and stable, and we do

We are intent on strengthening our relations with the

We share with the Soviet Union its wishes to develop

I was tired of the heavy clothing I had to wear because of the cold weather
in Paris. Hhen the first pleasant warm breezes greeted me as I got off

the plane that flew me to Baghdad. I knew I had to get rid of my winter
clothes quickly. The fall in Baghdad is like the spring: it is gentle with
the city's visitors and guests as though it were apologizing for the city's
summer heat.

I may be reprimanded for saying I was a visitor or a guest in Baghdad which
has never considered Arabs visitors or guests. Arabs come to Baghdad as
though they were coming to their homes. This is how Baghdad treats hundreds
of thousands of Arabs--Egyptians, Gulf citizens, Palestinians. Lebanese,
Syrians and Moroccans--and this is how it wants to be treated. Baghdad
wants the Arabs to reciprocate its feelings and its emotions.

Indeed. one does not feel that one is a stranger in Baghdad. One suddenly
loses the sad dejection that comes over one when he is in exile in Paris

or in Europe. far from his country. from his relatives, from his loved ones
and from his roots. One is reassured upon hearing the sounds of the Iraqi
dialect. sounds that suggest goodness. kindness and masculinity.

Baghdad is at war. This is the reality with which it has been dealing for
over 1 year. However, the sounds of buzzing airplanes and the sounds of
artillery are nowhere to be heard. The noise of workshops and of construc-
tion is drowning out the sounds of the war. This is what was suggested to
me by Baghdad as l blended in its crowds and in its hubbub on my way to
meet Saddam Husayn. '

This may be the first time in the history of a country that war has not
kept that country from going on with the course of life. War here does not
only mean destruction and death; war is not consuming all the capabilities,
the energies and the abilities of the country; war has not brought life to
a standstill. The war has provided an incentive for construction and for
making preparations for a better future. It is for this better future that
the Iraqi citizen is fighting and building. The Iraqi citizen gives up his
life for this future. but from his sacrifice a new vital force will spring.
and in peace time that force will turn into a verdant. shady tree.

Buildings are continuing to rise; bridges are being built; roads are being

paved and widened; hotels are being opened and are filling up with
thousands of visitors, tourists and business men; and the Tigris River is

flowing slowly and silently while the historical city is being transformed
gradually into a modern metropolis, with all its hubbub, prosperity and
dense population. And yet, at the same time, one feels that it is a comfor-
table city, a city that is at ease with itself. There is no affectation, no
gloom, no hardship and no misery.

The presidential palace is a piece of land with vegetation and gardens at
whose center stands a sprawling building, like most traditional buildings

in Baghdad. which seem to prefer horizontal expansion to vertical expan-
sion. The furniture is comfortable and elegant; it has an Iraqi folk charac-
ter, and it is neither luxurious nor ostentatious.

One is greeted and escorted to the library of the palace. It is a medium
size room; its walls are lined with bookcases whose glass covered shelves
are filled with thousands of old and modern books. In the corner next to a
desk that is placed in the front portion of the room is an Iraqi flag
wrapped around a column of moderate height.

I do not know what it is that makes me think of 'Abd-al-Nasir whenever

I meet with Saddam Husayn. Is it the similarity between the characters

of the two leaders? It may be. There is a curious similarity in their phy-
sique. Both men are tall with impressive appearances and captivating
features. Both have pleasant personalities that soon endear them to one
when one first meets with them. One feels that their physique harbored a
strong. inflexible will and a tremendous power of endurance and tenacity
in the face of responsibilities and events.

It may be that the two men pursued different and dissimilar roads to revo-
lution and then to power. 'Abd-al-Nasir realised the revolution the easier
way. He used one of the tools of government: the army. Saddam Husayn, how-
ever, realized the revolution by one of the means of the revolution: the
party. Therefore, Saddam Husayn's road to the revolution and to power was
more difficult; it was longer, more dangerous and more arduous than that of
Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir.

Although the means the two leaders pursued to bring about revolution and
achieve power were different and dissimilar. their objective was the same.
It is this sameness of objective that rounds out the similarity or identity
between them. It may be said that Saddam Husayn came to complete the course
of Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir, notwithstanding the former's observations on the
latter's style of government and view of the masses. Both men demonstrate
this nation's deep faith in Arabism and unity. Viewed with a pan-Arab emo-
tional awareness, they can only be seen as men who staunchly insisted on
their independence. Both men considered this independence to be an insepa-
rable part of their pan-Arab faith. As long as one was an Arab, one had

to be free of all restrictions and of all [forms of] subordination.

I would not be unfair to Jamal 'Abd-ai-ﬂasir if I were to say that he came
[to power] and became popular during the easy time, the time when Arabism

was a sweeping, emotional wave that shook thrones. folded alliances and
mocked obstacles and difficulties. Saddam Husayn, however, came [to power]

31

when the tide of Arabism had lost its momentum. its vigor and its lustre
and was floundering under the brunt and burden of blows that had been dealt
to it by foes and friends alike.

It was the fate of Saddam Husayn to make the shift from revolution to power
during the difficult time. It was his destiny that the banner of Arabism he
was carrying would be unfurled the day the banners of others were lowered.
It was his destiny to fly his banner amidst crowds of skeptics who doubted
everything: Arabism, unity, liberation, independence and everything for
which 'Abd-al-Nasir had fought. 'Abd-al-Nasir died in grief because he had
not attained any of the things he had fought for.

It was also the destiny of Saddam husayn to fight to protect the Arab
character of Iraq; he fought once in the north and another time in the
east. He fought this battle amidst the rancor of the rancorous and the
excesses and conspiracies of those among his own people who made up stories
about him. It were as though the battle was not theirs; it were as though
the destiny of Arabism was not their destiny; and it were as though the
Arabism of Saddam Husayn and the pan-Arabism of al-Ba'th posed a more
serious threat to them than the anti-Arab Persian movement which is mas-
querading in Khomeyni's religious habit.

I think I medicated long enough as I sat waiting for my interview with
Saddam ﬂusayn. I need only say that what fills the hearts of those who

have retained their faith in their nation with hope is the fact that
Arabism has a stronghold in lraq whose pillars were built by [that] man

on a firm foundation of work and construction. This was done at a time

when the doors to others' strongholds were breaking open in front of enemies
and usurpers and the bridges leading to them lay open to the greedy.

President Saddam Husayn soon came into the room. This time he was wearing
his military uniform. the same clothes he usually wears when he is touring
the battlefields. The only thing that distinguishes his uniform from that
of an officer can be seen in the supreme commander stripes he wears on

his broad shoulders.

The military uniform is becoming to the physique of the leader with the
impressive appearance. He is huge but not flabby. One senses [when one
meets him] that he is in the presence of a leader who has just returned
from the front. not from a military parade. This is Saddam Husayn: the
military uniform is not a matter of appearance for him; it is an expression
of a situation or a condition. it were as though his military uniform
served to remind Iraqis. Arabs and the whole world that his country was at

war. he wants to make his soldiers and his officers feel that he is sharing
their bunkers and that he is one of them.

However. military clothing does not change Saddam Husayn’s nature or his
mood. He has always been able a few moments after one meets with him. to
dispel any previous impressions one may have acquired of him from a certain
characterization or from any foreign propaganda against him. One discovers
that Saddam Husayn is a human being before being a revolutionary, a party

32

man or a statesman. he asks one how he is. and he communicates with one
plainly about the affairs and concerns of daily life, such as those that
interest and concern millions of ordinary people. He is concise; his ideas
are unequivocal; and his speech conveys a mixture that combines the poet's
imagination and the revolutionary's realism.

The burden and the responsibilities of the war have not gotten the better
of him. He maintains his composure, his courage and his ability to carry
on a conversation on various matters and to drift from one subject to
another without going into the subject of war and letting it take over the
conversation unless one asks him about it. He is a skillful conversa-
tionalist: his listening skills are as good as his persuasive skills. When
he speaks, he does so in a quiet voice. with a tone of self-confidence. His
eyes remind one of 'Abd-al-Nasir as they probe one's mind to find out what
one's opinion and position are.

Saddam Husayn began the interview by asking me about Lebanon. he is con-
cerned about my small country, and he thinks abOut it. He also asked me
what Lebanese public opinion was on the Iraqi-Persian war. I sensed that he
was greatly relieved when I told him truthfully that the Lebanese people,
especially those among them who are aware, did not understand why war had
broken out between Iraq and Iran. However, as the war developed and as

the Iranian leadership deteriorated and the truth about its Arab position
was revealed. the Lebanese people acquired a greater awareness of the vali-
dity and objectivity of the reasons that made Iraq rise to defend its Arab
character and the Arab character of the Gulf. I cited the letters that
AL-HATAN AL-‘ARABI has been receiving from everywhere in the vast homeland.
At first. there were many questions and there was sometimes criticism of
Iraq's position, but these letters soon became quite different. Today these
letters demonstrate the universal Arab conviction that Iraq's position is a
sound-one. The letters reflect an awareness of Iraq's point of view in the
face of Iranian ambitions against the Arab character of Iraq.

He talked about other subjects, and then he brought the conversation to an
end by talking about the experience of the political leadership in Iraq. He
explained the party's predicament before and after the 1963 setback and
until its course was corrected with the 1968 revolution.

Then he told me, "It is now your turn. What questions do you have for me?"
My first questions naturally dealt with the Arab-Persian confrontation.
[Question] Mr President. do you believe that there has been a change in
Arab feelings and points of view regarding the Iraqi-Persian confrontation?
Can you give us details about the positions of certain Arab and foreign
parties, for example. Syria. Libya. the Palestinians. Algeria, Turkey and
the Soviet Union?

[Answer] In general. we must say the truth. Not all the countries that

you have mentioned have had the same attitude towards the war. Some of them
understood it. and some had a negative attitude towards it.

But what is known with certainty now is that the regime in Iran helped

many people take a correct stand against it. It revealed the fact that

the attitudes of many had been wrong or deviant not because of a lack of
information or an inability to analyze the situation [correctly]. but
rather because of previous ill intentions to do harm to the Arab nation and
even to humanity.

In all cases we always make a distinction in the Arab homeland between

the position of some regimes and the position of Arab citizens. I believe
that this regime made it considerably easier for the Arab public to make an
accurate evaluation of Iran's regime. It is a backward, racist regime. It
is even suspected within its own ranks, and this is contrary to what was
being publicized about it being a progressive regime that is striving for
the liberation of Palestine. Liberating Palestine is not a matter of
rhetoric; it is a matter of intentions. Rhetoric will not liberate
Palestine; but intention: that are linked with a practical plan and with
concrete. practical individual incidents whose objective is the liberation
of Palestine can. This is my comment on the question.

[Question] How do you explain the fact that the Arab parties that sided
with [ran against Iraq have said nothing about the arms relationship
between Iran and Israel despite the fact that this relationship has been
exposed and established?

[Answer] Actually. I have no comment to make that would be more telling
than their own bias. Any comment I may make about their position will be
less effective than their own bias for the Iranian regime despite the fact
that the arms story between Iran and the Zionist enemy has been exposed.

Iraq's Steadfastness Is Due to Ideological Reasons

[Question] The Iraqi regime has established its steadfastness and its
cohesiveness in a lengthy confrontation with Iran, whereas signs of a break-
down are beginning to appear on the Iranian side. What in your opinion

are the political. military and psychological factors that helped form

these two disparate positions on both sides of the battle line?

The president paused for a while as though he were trying to collect the
essence of 1 year of Iraqi steadfastness against the Persian attack.

[Answer] The principal reason for this lies in the fact that power, dis-
tinction and superiority are not technical ingredients, but rather ideolo-
gicnl ones. Thus the matter has to do with who is proceeding within the
proper course of history and who is proceeding outside the proper course of
history. For it superiority in combat against Iranian aggression were
simply the technical superiority of the air force. the tanks. the
artillery. the naval force or all of these. the case would have been dif-
ferent and the effect of other factors would have become evident. Iran
would have been favored since nature gave Iran a special advantage and
since technical superiority would take a back seat to strategic factors

by virtue of nature and by virtue of the superior historical makeup. such

34

FORiOFFﬂJAl.USE(NVLY
FINICMWWCIAI.USE(MVLY

as the area of land and the number of the population. Iran, for example.
has more land and more people than Iraq does.

But the principal reason for Iraq's steadfastness and cohesiveness lies

in its ideological superiority. This is how matters shape up: one case

is antithetical to history and to historical evolution and antithetical to
all the central components of the features of the modern age; and a case
that is consistent with history, consistent with proper historical evolu-
tion and with all the components of the modern age in its basic, radiant
features. This is the case that exists in Iraq; its antithesis exists in
Iran. Therefore. the political regime in Iran is on the brink of disaster,
and the political regime in Iraq is becoming stronger every month.

This is not speculation on my part; these matters have become known. But
let us give only one undeniable example. The Iranian regime withdraws
Khomeyni's guards from the front to shore up Khomeyni's strength in the
cities, including Tehran. and to face the opposition. But the regime in
iraq sends the presidential guard to the front to participate [in the
fighting]. and the president is left with only his bodyguards who provide
him with direct personal protection.

We tour the countryside, and we spend the night in rural areas in the home
of any peasant. but they cannot get out of a particular hiding place or
they would be exposed to assassination and murder by the opposition.

It was not because we needed additional soldiers on the front that we sent
the presidential guard there, but it was rather because of their wishes
that no units of the Iraqi army be denied the honor of taking part in com-
bat on the front. Iraqi citizens and the Iraqi army share our feelings. On
this basis and in accordance with the wishes of the presidential guard, its
units were sent in sequence to the front. and they took part in what were
for us the most difficult battles.

All the people of Iraq and all the Iraqi army make up the presidential
guard. The area of the presidential palace is no longer that specific pres-
cribed area. but it is rather the area of all Iraq. Wherever we may be in
Iraq. the people are the presidential guard. Thus, superiority. as I
believe it is, is ideological superiority. It is the superiority of one who
is right. one who represents the proper historical course over another who
is wrong and who represents a course that is counter to the proper course
of history.

[Question] Do you believe that a change in Iran would favor bringing a
quick end to the lighting?

[Answer] I believe that any ruler in Iran who wants what is good for his
country has to stop the fighting. Therefore. everyone who wants what is
good for his country has to stop the fighting regardless of the technical
conditions. wherever it may be in this regime now or in a new regime with
new rulers. But I believe that he who wants what is good for the people of
Iran and wants to rule has to stop the fighting.

FOI'OFFHJAI.USIINULY

[Question] The fighting is gradually turning into warfare in the fixed
positions. Do you expect there will be military activity on the front as
the war begins its second year? th are the Iranians concentrating their
attacks on the central sector? Does the Iraqi political leadership still
hold the view that Iranian cities. like Abadan for instance are not to be
penetrated?

[Answer] There are some details that I will not discuss with you because
when we are involved in fighting and talk about details and intentions, the
enemy benefits. But apart from everything else. let me say that from the
Iraqi point of view, or in the minds of Iraqis. the war is a case of self-
defense. We are defending our sovereignty and our national and pan-Arab
security. This situation requires whatever measures might achieve this
objective and prolong national and pan-Arab security. Use of any means we
think would succeed in ensuring security and use of any land we think is
necessary for security [would be justifiable]. He have to give up any land
we think is not essential. All this constitutes the defense that is
required against those people who attacked us in an obvious fashion as
that was mentioned in all documents. They even shelled cities and some oil
installations on 4 September 1980, and they closed Shatt al-‘Arab on 18
October 1980.

We Are Prepared To Talk with the Iranian Opposition

I wanted to find out what the Iraqi president thought about the split that
occurred recently in the political leadership in Iran and the effect of
that split on the war.

[Question] Do you believe that the various rightist or leftist factions
of the Iranian opposition are serious and sincere in their [professed]
inclination to end the war with Iraq. or is the purpose of their present
negative attitude toward the war designed to win the sympathy of Iraq and
of the Arabs in their confrontation with the existing regime?

[Answer] I believe that the attitude of some parties of the Iranian opposi-
tion and the statements that were made by them describing the intentions of
Khomeyni's regime as one that wanted the war to continue for purely per-
sonal. local reasons are accurate. They are historically accurate, objec-
tively accurate, tactically accurate and strategically accurate.

As to whether or not the Iranian opposition would abide by this position if
it were to come to power. that is another matter. However. in reply to a
previous question I said that any ruler who loves his people could not wish
to see them killed for any reason. Any ruler who wants to rule must be-
friend the Arabs. One of the conditions for his country's security is the
establishment of friendship with his neighbors, especially since his neigh-
hors make no conditions that are at the expense of his security. his
national sovereignty or his legitimate national interests. Iraq's con-
ditions are clear: Iraqis and Arabs are to be secure; they are to protect
their sovereignty and respect others.

36

FOR<HWHCIAJ.USE(NNLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

Regardless of anything else. we are prepared to talk with any opposition
group, and we are prepared to offer that group support and reinforcement.
We are prepared to offer them everything that would place then in a better
position without setting prior conditions on what their position on war
or peace would be [when they come to power]. We leave their position or
their opinion on the war or the peace to the future.

[Question] Regarding Arab and international efforts, are there new efforts

being made to solve the dispute between Iraq and the present regime in
Iran?

[Answer] There are no new Arab or international efforts. There are only
those bodies that were formed by the non-aligned countries and by the
Islamic Conference.

[Question] Do you still aaintain the position that Iraq does not want
the disintegration of Iran? [If so], why?

[Answer] We still believe that the interests of the area and perhaps the
interests of humanity as well are not served by fragmenting Iran. However,
we are no longer intent on the unity of Iran. There is a difference between
working to break up Iran's unity and not being a positive factor in its
unity. Iran is a country at war with us. Therefore. we are not interested
in its unity or disunity, but prolonging the war, along with the factors of
chaos and backwardness in Iran, may make the task easy for those who wish
to break up Iran's unity.

At any rate what we are basically interested in is that peace be achieved
on principles that guarantee our interests and our national and pan-Arab
sovereignty. We want to live freely in our country, and we want to choose
our course. We want the Iranians to live freely in their country and to
choose their course by themselves [also].

[Question] How true is the news in western or Iranian newspapers which
talks about rebel movements on the borders in the autonomous region (in
North Iraq) which are taking advantage of the dispute between Iraq and Iran?

Saddam Husayn smiled quietly.

[Answer] There may be infiltrators on the borders with Iran. with Turkey
and with Syria. and any number of those infiltrators may fire a few cart-
ridges and fire shots on the roads and on defenseless people traveling in
those areas. Such things may occur in any mountainous region in the world.

However. from a practical standpoint there has been no substantive change
in the northern area from what was there before the war.

[Question] Mr President. some people are saying that the dispute with
Iran has restricted or limited the Iraqi role on the Arab scene and has
forced it to compromise. Is this true?

[Answer] Yes, the dispute with Iran has restricted and has limited Iraq.

37

“WWW!”
F0!.0F1ﬂ(]Al.USEimNLY

More precisely it has limited some aspects in the usage of Iraqi capabi-
lities which would have been put to use elsewhere. This is an objective
fact. But it is not true that the dispute with Iran has made Iraq com-
promise its positions or not take any positions where unequivocal positions
had to be taken. He don't know compromise. The fact that more mature expres-
sions of our positions may have coincided with the war is due to the
maturity of Iraqi policy and not to the war. This is possible. Our posi-
tions are not, however. compromises. They are an expression of revolu-
tionary conviction, and they will continue to be so.

lraq Supports the Collective Arab Position

[Question] Where does Iraq see itself then, Mr President, amidst this
polarization on the Arab scene between the course of Camp David, the course
of moderation and that of extremism?

[Answer] We see ourselves assuming the proper nationalist position which
is not extreme, does not compromise and does not yield. The proper nationa-
list position on iundamental questions and the professional expression of
that position is something the Arabs are to consider with an open mind,
without boundaries or background influences. Any position they agree about
on such questions would be more proper than any individual position. It is
true that each one of us must start out with the notion that his point of
view represents the proper nationalist position. However. we represent not
only the Arabs of the masses; we also represent regimes and rulers. The
proper position is that which all the Arabs agree upon on the basis of a
heart-felt desire to achieve the interests of the nation. quite apart from
any outside influences or personal, selfish or regional interests. Any
position about which all the Arabs agree is better than the position of a
group or an individual. As far as the Palestinian question is concerned,
we will not work against a position upon which all the Arabs and the PLO
have agreed, regardless of our ideological and our intellectual posture.
There is a difference between not working against something and being with

something. He may not be in favor of the position. but that does not mean
we will work against it.

i rephrased the question because I wanted to get a more detailed answer.

[Question] Mr President. a few proposals regarding a solution to the
Middle East crisis have taken shape recently. What is Iraq's opinion, for
example. on the plan that has been proposed by Saudi Arabia? Is this plan
suitable as an Arab alternative to the Camp David plan?

[Answer] i said in my answer to the previous question that looking for an
alternative that was relatively better than the Camp David plan or any
other plan that may be proposed was not important. what we must do is look
with an open mind and a vital Arab conscience for a position that is his—
torically and actually more correct. Every Arab may in his own mind believe
that the practical course he is proposing to solve crucial Arab questions.
chief among which is the question of Palestine. is better than what others
are proposing.

38

FOR 0F1ﬂ€1Al.l£ﬂi(MVLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

However, as far as the mechanics of getting the work out are concerned,

it is our view that the more correct position is that which all the Arabs
agree upon, including the PLO. Such an agreement would be reached in'a
healthy climate where open-minded thoughts are freely expressed. There is a
stipulation in the resolutions of the Baghdad Summit Conference, which
rejected Camp David, that any separate solution to this question would be
rejected and that the normal place for any solution was at Arab summit
conferences.

I asked President Saddam Husayn what he thought of the U.S.—Libyan confron-
tation.

[Question] lraq strongly condemned the U.S. fleet's confrontation with
the Libyan airplanes in the Gulf of Sidra. However, Libyan propaganda por-
trayed the shooting down of the two Libyan airplanes as a military victory
for Libya. This was then followed by President al-Qadhdhafi's threat that
Libya would enter into a nuclear confrontation with the United States.

Do you believe that an involvement in an unequal military confrontation
would serve the Arab cause? Do you approve of this method of confrontation
with the enemy?

The quiet smile reappeared tn Saddam Husayn's face.

[Answer] At any rate our position on the fighting between Libyan airplanes
and 0.5. airplanes is a position that we have always declared and held on
to. When an Arab fights with a foreigner to defend his sovereignty. his
security and his honor, we side with the Arab.

But if President al-Qadhdhafi makes a statement in this or another inci-
dent, as was stated in your question. we would in all cases hold that an
Arab needs to understand himself, not to disparage, belittle or aggrandize
himself without having the capabilities and the principal ingredients for
building the proper character that can play its historical role in building
the country and fighting for it. Therefore we are always delighted when an
Arab, like a foreigner--any foreigner whatosever--feels that he has a right
to life. that he has a right to choose the course of construction and that
he is capable of building and defending his life and his choices as he
proceeds with his construction efforts regardless of attempts foreigners
make against him and even if these foreigners who are against us were
superior in their professional and technical capabilities. However, we
always think that it is proper for an Arab to make the proper preparations
for forming the national and pan-Arab character without talking about these
preparations in a loose framework. This is a general appraisal of what
things ought to be like on the Arab and national scenes.

Thanks to the Arabs of the Gulf
From the Gulf of Sidra in Libya we moved to the Arabian Gulf.

[Question] Mr President, Iraq has good relations with the countries of
the Arabian Gulf. However, this does not necessarily prevent one from

39

FORfﬂﬂ1CLALI£ﬂEONlY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

saying that there are sometimes different points of view about some mar-
ginal or secondary issues. such as the disagreement with one of the
countries over U.S. military presence. How does Iraq reconcile its stra-
tegic course in preserving good relations with the countries of the Gulf
with its differences with them? Is Iraq satisfied with the position of the
Gulf countries on the confrontation between Iraq and Iran?

[Answer] We must start with the fact that there are 22 regimes, 22 choices
and 22 leadership bodies in the Arab homeland. Friendships between the
Arabs, with this number of regimes, and the world are varied. That is,
these friendships are not the same; they are different.

we must always start with central, constant facts [on the one hand] and
with others that are subject to change and motion. Among the central facts
is that we must not assume that because of proximity and fraternal rela-
tions points of view on all the affairs of politics and life would be
identical.

It is certain that conflict in crucial questions weakens the fraternal

tie and diminishes its fervor. The other rule is that differences in points
of view or in positions must not lead us to despair and must not keep us
from making sincere attempts to interact with opinions and with efforts to
develop these positions or to improve them. This is to take place in the
context of the fraternal, national responsibility we have for our relations
with our brothers, the Arabs, or for the relations our Arab brothers have
with us.

We assume that our Arab brothers have a responsibility toward Iraq in
general to tell us what they believe is wrong in our policy and to
encourage us [to do] what they believe is right. Iraq is also entitled to
exercise the same responsibility toward its Arab brothers, whether they be
in the Gulf or outside the Gulf.

Among the matters on which we have a clear and an understandable point

oi view is this: [we think] that it is not in the interests of Arabs to
have foreign soldiers on their land, whether these soldiers are there in
bases or using facilities which yield the same results as those that are
yielded by foreign bases on Arab land. Arab sovereignty, as well as its
terms, must remain the domain of the Arab people. Sovereignty is not a
superficial process. In order that we may say we are exercising full sove-
reignty over our land, there are terms which are to be observed in our
actions. Among these terms is that which states that foreigners must not
have a corner of the land which they can dispose of freely as though it
were their own. Therefore. we have always been opposed to foreign bases and
to facilities which lead to the same results that foreign bases lead to.

We oppose foreign bases for this and another consideration as well. We
believe in the policy of non-alignment which presupposes first that, regard-

less of our national and patriotic interests, we are not to enter into the
framework of international balances so as to favor this or the other party.

40

FIM!(HHHC1A1.1E“B(MVLY
IN)! OFTWCJAl.lEﬂE(ﬂHLY

The third consideration is this: the presence of any foreign base on the
Arab homeland has to be countered by another foreign base. This is deter-
mined by the framework [which decrees that] the strategic balance of the
two superpowers or of the major countries is to be preserved. When there is
a 0.8. base anywhere in the Arab homeland, we expect the Soviets to try to
. establish another base opposite it so as to maintain the balance in accor-
dance with the Soviet and American view of the strategic balance problem
and the problem of preserving the balance of powers in the world.

From a practical standpoint then, from whose share is this [land] being
taken? it is being taken from the nation's share whether this base is
Soviet, American, French, German, Polish or Japanese. The nation pays the
price. For these reasons we have always been against the presence of armies
in the form of bases or facilities, which yield the same results as those
yielded by foreign bases set up on Arab land and in Arab waters.

Regarding the attitude of our brothers in the Gulf states, including Saudi
Arabia. on the matter of the war with Iran we say that despite the fact
that the Gulf states have so far not declared a political position suppor-
ting Iraq. we were reprimanded, nevertheless, by some of our brothers
because we made no reference to the facilities and assistance they offered
us. And they are still offering us assistance even though the assistance
and facilities they are offering and the support required by the situation
may be the subject of debate with our Arab brothers. However, we must
express much gratitude to the Gulf states for the facilities and assistance
they offered lraq even though it is in a state of war. This aid has special
results, and we thank them for it.

As to what our position is or what is the position we prefer and believe

in, [this is where we stand]. He would accept from Arabs a heart-felt state-
ment of support if they really supported us and if there was a reason why
they could not declare their support for us publicly. If they cannot

declare their support publicly and if they believe that if they were to
declare their position they will be hurt and they and we will not be able

to ward off this damage, we would accept such a position from them.

But what is the attitude that any Arab should assume, whether he be in
Morocco, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia. Syria, Libya or Algeria vis a vis the enemy
who thrust the war upon us? His attitude ought to be that of an Arab. The
proper attitude for Arabs is to support us with their men, their weapons,
their funds and their political and publicity posture. All Arabs without
exception ought to assume this attitude vis a vis the Iraqi-Iranian war
because this was the attitude we assumed when they clashed with the
foreigner. This will be our attitude with every Arab when he clashes with a
foreigner.

When the war is over, we will remember everything in detail that Arabs
offered us because lraqis have a right to know this in detail so they can
behave accordingly with a special pan-Arab responsibility.

[Question] I shifted from the Gulf to the Iraqi-Syrian dispute. I said.
"In the decade of the seventies the relationship between Iraq and Syria

was subject to vicissitudes. In a recent Statement you described those
relations as not good. Does this mean that an understanding or an agreement
between the two political leaderships in the two countries is impossible in
the future?"

The rapid shift from a thorny issue to a sensitive one did not embarrass
Saddam Husayn. His reply was marked by a mix of a statesman's tolerance.
the firmness of a man of principles and the flexibility of a politician.

[Answer] I am not inclined [to favor] absolute situations in politics,
except those that are by nature absolute. Among the absolute rules are
[those two]: there is one God. and justice is a constant objective and a
constant course. however, in situations that may be mutable, in politics
[for example]. absolutes may not be applied because one may be forced to
retract an absolute statement he may have said one day.

This does not mean that there are assumptions underlying relations between
us and the regime in Syria other than those underlying current relations or
that there are attitudes between us and Syria other than current ones. The
attitudes of Syria's regime toward us are known. Chief among them is
Syria's attitude supporting the Iranian enemy that attacked us. However,

as a responsible person I do not wish to state political facts and I do

not wish to make absolute judgments. I will say. however. that current

attitudes make any positive. significant relationship [in the future] impos-
sible.

The Defense Companies Make Up a New Sectarian Army

[Question] Mr President. the political dispute between the Syrian and
Iraqi regimes is well-known. but is Iraq objecting only to the Syrian
regime's political positions. or is it also objecting to the organic make-
up and the structure of the Syrian regime?

I sensed that I had touched a deep wound that had not yet healed itself.
Saddam Musayn's features showed pain mixed with sorrow for Syria's con—
dition. The moment of silence that transpired between my question and his
reply was pronounced.

[Answer] We object to any narrow sectarian makeup. and we object to erro-
neous or deviant policies. The regime in Syria is known to the Syrians

and to the world not only as a regime whose postures are known to be erro-
neous and deviant. but it is also known as a purely sectarian regime.

Let us take one subject and ask [a few questions]: Are the Defense and
Struggle Companies now equal to the entire Syrian army? Are they superior
to the army in arms and numbers or not? What is the sectarian makeup of the
Defense and Struggle Companies?

If we were to assume that the Defense and Struggle companies were given

42

FOR10FFKJA1.USI10NIN
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

that name because their essential prerequisites do not exceed a limited num-
ber of companies and the weapons, equipment and individuals that are essen-
tial prerequisites of independent companies are limited and do not reach

the level of prerequisites for "the new army" of the so-called Defense and
Struggle Companies. we would then conclude that these [units] were called
companies because they are supposed to be unrelated to a regiment for trans-
porting one, two or three companies. In practice. however. these units are
now defense and struggle divisions as far as their size and their weapons
are concerned. and they all have a special sectarian makeup. The regime

came out with a case for not being able to impose its presence in the

Syrian army without creating grievances that would be rejected directly in
the army. Therefore. the regime created a new army with a sectarian makeup
that was separate from the original army. The regime is also intent on
having sectarian circles present within the official army to function as

its sentinel and to preserve the balance [in its favor] with a sectarian
framework. We believe that the policy in Syria is dangerous; it is dan-
gerous to the ruler. and it is dangerous to Syria as a whole and to Syria's
future as well.

[Question] Naturally. my small country. Lebanon. had a share in the inter-
view with Saddam Husayn. i told him. "Some Arabs are saying that Iraq's
position on the Lebanese crisis is based principally on Iraq's dispute

with Syria. is this true?"

The features of the iraqi president relaxed again as he said:

[Answer] Did our position on the Lebanese crisis change when our relation-
ship with Syria was good? If our position changed. then the explanation of
those Arabs is correct. If it has been constant. then our explanation is
correct. Our position is a national position regardless of the Syrian
regime's position. It is a position that wants any Arab country to be
stable, to control its own sovereignty and to have no interference in its
domestic affairs. Is this strange? Have matters reached the point that when
such a position is declared by a certain body we consider it strange and we
look for incorrect explanations for it?

Our position on Lebanon is a national one, and if any similar situation
were to recur, God forbid, in any part of the Arab homeland, our position
would be the same. Take Libya. for example. which sided with Iran. When
Libya's airplanes clashed with U.$. ai‘planes. we sided with Libya. This
in a matter that Is not tied to the nositions of others; it is basically
tied to our position which is based on our ideological assumptions and

on the views we hold on the questions of the Arab nation.

[Question] what is your evaluation of what the inflamed Lebanese inci-
dents have come to? How can a secure way out of this situation or an Arab
solution to it be achieved that would guarantee that all Lebanese people of

[Answer] Let me say that no Arab solution can be 100 percent honorable.

It may be better than the present situation, but it would not be honorable.
I know the Arab organization, and I know the spontaneous and outside
_infiuences that are applied to it. Therefore, I cannot describe any Arab
solution, no matter what that solution might be, as an honorable solution
unless it is a solution that comes from all Arabs in the presence of
Lebanon. Such a solution would be better than others. However, it too would
not be quite honorable because I know collective Arab decisions. I know
their assumptions; I know the factors that influence them; and I know how
the trade-offs are made. I knew how one word can be deleted and another

added to favor this or the other formula and to have this or the other
formula accepted.

The solution that I believe would guarantee Lebanon's interests is a
Lebanese solution. that is, the solution that would be chosen by all the
parties concerned with the struggle without exception. This solution would
be reached under the umbrella of the nation; it would be reached in the
interests of Lebanon and its unity. I believe that the Lebanese people

can come up with a proper solution to the question of Lebanon under such
an umbrella. This solution would be the best solution. In order for the
solution to be practical and not to impair national principles, it would
be best for the PLO to have a limited presence in [the formulation of]
such a solution.

[Question] Does Iraq believe that the Lebanese crisis can be solved sepa-
rately from the Palestinian question?

[Answer] Yes. Hhen the Lebanese people want to solve it and when the Arabs
stop interfering in their affairs. But when the wishes of the Lebanese
people are not represented in the resolutions formulated by responsible
leadership, when those wishes are found only in the minds of the Lebanese
people, [a solution would be hard to reach]. I know that all the Lebanese
people without exception, Christians, Muslims and all political factions,
want a unified, independent, stable Lebanon now. But I am referring to the
presence of leadership, for when the Lebanese people find themselves with-
out responsible leadership, and when their ranks are sabotaged by some Arab
regimes, the situation then will remain as it is, and the enemies of the
nation and of Lebanon will continue to link the solution for Lebanon's
situation with a solution tc the question of Palestine. This would impose
humiliating solutions in Palestine and would turn the political situation
in Lebanon to a source of destruction for the national struggle in addition
in destroying Lebanon [itself]. But when the responsible political Lebanese
decisions are replesented not only in the official regime but also in all
the levels of responsible leadership in the political and popular organiza-
tions and in all the parties without exception, the question of Lebanon can
then be solved before a solution for the question of Palestine is found. It
is then that that solution will be satisfactory to the Palestinians._lt
will be understood by them and particularly by the PLO.

[Question] From Lebanon we shifted to the hot sands of the vast Arab
Maghreb.

Mr President, what do you think about the heated conditions between Sudan
and Libya and between Horocco and Algeria? Uhat is your explanation for
this stage?

[Answer] All Arab disputes weaken Arabs. This is a general rule and a fact
whose opposite we cannot affirm. This is an absolute, objective fact. We
reject all fighting between Arabs regardless of the reasons and motives for
such fighting. He consider fighting among Arabs serious. Whenever there

is an opportunity, and such an opportunity must always be available, we
must solve our problems without fighting; at least Arabs must not fight
Arabs.

Let Mubarak Consider Carefully Uhat Happened to al-Sadat

[Question] Today, since the assassination of al-Sadat, all events have
been focusing on Egypt. "hat is your evaluation of what happened and of
what is happening? What is your evaluation of the action and the reaction
to it?

[Answer] Regardless of anything else, what happened was expected. Not

that it was expected in the absolute sense. but it was expected in the
sense that any revolutionary, popular leader, even if he were popular among
his people, may be assassinated. There are similar cases and examples in
history.

Al—Sadat died. however, the day he visited Jerusalem and not since the day
he signed the Camp David agreement. I believe he died on the day he visited
Jerusalem and was buried the day he signed the Camp David agreement.

What happened in Egypt, had you seen it on television. was that many people
who were on the reviewing stand [with al-Sadat] found others to [help them]
shake the dust off their suits. Some may have found others to help them
pick up the chairs that had fallen on them and to help them get up. But
al-Sadat was alone. There was no one for him among all those who were there
on the reviewing stand. He found no one [to help him] in all the military
parade from which fighters had come out firing their guns at him. This is
the most important point: there was no one for him. Had there been anyone
lor him. scores of people would have quickly used their bodies to keep the
bullets away from him. Al-Sadat may have been killed, but he would have
remained alive. had there been those among the people who would have pro—
tected him from the bullets. it is this situation that will explain what
will happen.

We are hoping that the new rulers will consider carefully what happened.

We hope they will make decisions that would make their international rela-
tions more balanced and their relations with the Arab nation more vital and
immediate as a matter of principle and as an actual fact. This is what 1 am
hoping. I am hoping that the rulers of Egypt will pursue this course and
not that which al-Sadat pursued.

The established tact is that what happened, had you seen it on television,

45

EOI‘OIIICIKLIISEGDNIN
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

and had you noticed the steadiness with which the guerilla fighters
advanced until they were extremely close to al-Sadat before firing their
weapons, you would have become certain beyond any doubt that those fighters
were part of a popular psychological condition that prepared them fully in
their relationship with the people to the fact that if they were to die in
their attack on al-Sadat, they will become national heroes. Otherwise. it
would not have been possible for them to advance with such steadfastness
and such courage to carry out this guerilla operation.

I saw people removing chairs that were lying on top of their friends, and
they were throwing those chairs on al-Sadat. Al-Sadat was the last one and
not the first one to be asked about. This fact explains the meaning of
al-Sadat's isolation, even from those in his entourage. This is because the
entourage of a government that is disintegrating is not the same as the
entourage of a responsible leadership and government of the people.

We hope that the new president will consider and understand these facts.
One of these facts [he must consider] is the fact that he is not one of the
July revolutionaries. Even the prestige that al-Sadat had for a period of
time early in his administration. the new president cannot have in Egypt,
given the same conditions. He is also not one of the most prominent
officers in the Egyptian army. He was a senior officer in the Egyptian army
when he became vice president. He is taking over a country whose economic
condition is not like that which existed when al-Sadat took over the govern-
ment. Now, the economic condition is worse than what it was early in
al-Sadat's administration. The new president's political condition in his
relationship with the Arabs is well-known, and his international standing.
other than his relationship with the west, is not good. Al-Sadat took over
the government after 'Abd-al-Nasir, and opposition had been crushed comp-
letely. Now the new president is taking over the government amidst an oppo-
sition which. among its other actions, killed al-Sadat. He has to realize
these facts. He has to realize that chief among the reasons that made this
group kill al-Sadat was his position on the question of the Arab-Zionist
struggle. We are hoping that the new president will be guided to the proper
solution. It is then that he or anyone else will be able to rule Egypt

in a manner that would be satisfactory to the people. This would make Egypt
part of the [Arab] nation and enable Egypt to solve its problems in a
better way. But if he follows the same course that al-Sadat followed, then
the judgment on that matter is already known.

[Question] It is being hesitantly whispered in some Arab circles that

the new Egyptian president, Husni Mubarak, may be invited to the next Arab
summit conference this month in Fez. What is Iraq's position on the possi-
bility of Hubarak's participation in this conference?

[Answer] We must first ask was Iraq's position a personal position on
al-Sadat? Has the position of all the Arab brothers who approved the resolu-
tions of the Baghdad Summit also a personal position. This is not a matter
of whether or not the new president attends. The boycott against al-Sadat's
regime was carried out not because he did not attend the Baghdad Summit Con-
ference, but because he adopted a course that conflicted with that of the

46

FINI¢MHNC1AI.[EHE(HHLY
FOR10FFKJAI.U§E(NVLY

nation. In the final analysis, whether or not the Egyptian president
attends the conference, the attitude of Iraq or of other countries towards
him and his regime at the summit conference and outside the summit con-
ference will be determined on the basis of evaluating the position he will
take on the course that brought al-Sadat to his well-known end. He will be
watching the regime and hoping that it will pursue a new course. In fact,
it is in its interests to pursue a new course.

[Question] Hr President, the starting point in the opposition to Camp
David was the Baghdad Conference and its resolutions in 1978. The events
that occurred after that undermined Arab solidarity which had been achieved
under the auspices of that conference. Is there not an Arab effort that
ought to be made to reinforce the resolutions of the Baghdad Summit Con-
ference? "hat is Iraq's role in this, taking into consideration conditions
in Egypt, the continued Israeli aggression and the Camp David conference?

[Answer] In all cases we must look for everything that would strengthen
the Arabs, and we must make outstanding efforts in that regard. The estab-
lished fact is that the Baghdad Summit spared the Arabs disasters that
could have been worse than Camp David. All sincere Arabs have to remember
this fact.

Iraq has to be present in any new effort that is made to increase the power
of Arabs and to reduce attempts that are being made in their midst to frag-
ment them. I am not saying, as other conceited and ignorant people do, that
without Iraq nothing will happen. I think that the nation is greater than
any country, and the prestige of the nation is not the sum total of the
prestige of the countries. The nation's prestige is the product of the
actions its citizens take on the right course. I have faith and I believe
that Iraq always sees the interests of the nation with a detailed presence.
Therefore, I believe that any form of Iraq's presence that would strengthen
the nation is an important factor.

[Question] Some nationalist forces of the opposition inside Egypt are
criticizing the method that was used in carrying out the Arab boycott.
That method is criticized for making no distinction between the Egyptian
regime and the Arab people in Egypt. and for hurting the Egyptian Arab
masses in the interests of the regime. These forces are also criticizing
the attempt made by some regimes to interfere in their affairs. They say
this breaks up their powers. where do you stand on this matter, and how do
you think it can be remedi-d?

[Answer] I believe first that everyone must give up the guardianship men—
tality. The people of Egypt are an ancient, great, patriotic and nationa-
listic people. When our relationship with the people of Egypt is a frater-
nal and a national relationship, we must give up the logic of guardianship
and the logic of the superior view and deal with them as we do with
brothers, with a national, responsible viewpoint.

This is a general judgment. We reject the attitude of those who say that a
position places the rulers and the people in one rank. He reject [this

‘7

FINICIHNCIAI.UBE10NIX
FOR OFFKJAL.USE(NNLY

notion] with any ruler and with any part of our people in any Arab country.
We have always thought that in the Arab homeland there are people and a
nation and there are also rulers. The failure to make a distinction between
the rulers and the people is a mistake. We must always make a distinction
between one case and another, between one position and another, between a
ruler and the people. especially when the ruler and the people are miles
apart from each other.

This is a constant condition in our thinking. We had this in mind with
regard to our people in Egypt, in the most critical stages of the psycholo-
gical condition that the nation went through immediately after Camp David.
When we went to the Tripoli Conference we adamantly rejected a boycott

of the devotian people. We stated that the consequences and the formulation
of thr h -ott must be against the regime and the ruler. This principle

was endorsed at the Baghdad Summit so as to weaken and isolate the regime
but without hurting the people. The evidence for this lies in the fact that
we opened our doors to our fellow Egyptians. Iraq became their second home
where they could live as equals with iraqis, enjoying the same and occa-
sionally more rights and privileges than Iraqis.

[Question] 0n the occasion of the next summit conference for the Movement
of Non-Aligned countries in Baghdad, I asked the Iraqi president, "The
Movement of Non-Aligned countries has lost its lustre and its brilliance.
Is this because its historical leaders are no longer with us or because
political conditions in the world have changed?"

[Answer] It is a fact that political conditions in Chi world are the funda-
mental reason for this. but this does not mean that the loss of its his-
torical leaders did not play a role in reducing the lustre of non-alignment
and diminishing its positions. The historical leaders of that movement have
always played a role both in regional and international movements and in
their national regimes as well.

However, we must not view the role of the Movement of Non-Aligned countries
and the modes which express its positions in the same way we used to view
them when the movement consisted of a few small countries and when its
first founders were Tito, Nehru. 'Abd-al-Nasir, Sukarno and others. The
fact is that in the past Third World countries were either subject to wes-
tern colonialism or struggling to liberate themselves. Some countries in
Asia, Africa or in Latin America had recently won their independence. At
that time the Soviet Union had not come out of eastern Europe, and the
conduct of Americans with Third World countries was not like their conduct
with them now.

The two most important changes in the international sphere now are [as
follows]: [first], the United States entered the Third World to succeed old
European colonialism. Its relations with Third World countries differ from
the relations it had with them in the fifties. The United States has become
an imperialist leader. [Second], the Soviet Union has come out of eastern
Europe: it has direct relations with well-known regimes in Third World
countries and it exercises influence in well-known Third World countries.

48

F0. OFFKJAI.USE(NWLY
FORiOFFKJAl.USIi0NLN

These facts are evident to everyone at the conferences of non—aligned
countries.

Thus there are three trends within the [bloc of] non-aligned countries;

one is influenced by and related to Soviet strategy; one is influenced

by and related to U.S. strategy; and an independent trend. But within the
two [former] trends there are those who yearn for independence. At the same
time there are objective factors that place those countries within either
the trend which is influenced by U.S. strategy or that which is influenced
by Soviet strategy. These factors are due to the country's weapons situa-
tion, its economic condition or its political condition.

These are facts, and it is in accordance with these facts that we must
view the non-alignment policy. However, the role of non-alignment is still
needed. “are than any other time in the past its role is fundamental to the
purpose of spreading peace or at least helping provide the factors for
peace and stability in the world. This is what we believe in and what we
are striving for.

[Question] Let us go back a little to the incident of israel's bombing

of Iraqi nuclear installations. Does Iraq have doubts about whether western
parties. such as the United States, had anything to do with the incident,
such as offering facilities or information to Israel to carry out the opera-
tion? 00 you believe that these doubts have anything to do with the fact
that there are 0.5. AHACS airplanes in the skies of the Gulf?

The United States Knew

[Answer] I believe I answered a similar question last July, and I said
that suspicions about the U.S. attitude toward what Israel did to the July
reactor were justifiable. He still believe that the Israeli action was not
far from an international conspiracy that was suggested by or directly
related to some of the major countries or the superpowers that are related
to Israel. The Israeli action may be related to Israel's search for the
trend that would be desirable and acceptable to these countries.

What is certain in all cases is that we cannot possibly accept the United
States' claim that it did not know of the incident until it occurred. "0
one can believe the United States. At the same time we cannot believe that
the AHACS airplanes lacked the technical capability to find out the move-
ment ol the airplanes when they turned toward Iraqi territory.

what is certain. however. is that it would never occur to us that our
brothers in Saudi Arabia were involved in this. This never occurred to

us before or after the incident.

[Question] ltalian newspapers have recently claimed that the nuclear reac-
tor operation was [the result of] domestic sabotage and that the raid was

8 mere COVGIUP.

[Answer] I think this is an obvious Zionist attempt to reduce the

49

“ORIGINICIAI.USIi0Nlﬂ
FORi0FFﬂJAl.USE20NLY

[intensity of] the world's reaction. It were as though the Israelis thought
that the world was naive enough to forget even their own statenents. They
themselves stated that they did bomb the reactor. At the same time this is
a professional attempt to promote the role of Israeli intelligence in Third
world countries and to show that Israeli intelligence is so precise that it
timed the raid to occur simultaneously with the destructive action under-
taken by lsrael's intelligence agents inside the Iraqi reactor. This is
false. The destruction that occurred was a result of the air bombing.

[Question] Iraq reached a preliminary agreement with France on rebuilding
the nuclear reactor. In your opinion. how much time will this take? "hat
is your evaluation of relations with the new French regime?

[Answer] Relations are good. The French, or the new French regime is
intent on developing relations between us and them on the same principles
and with the same spirit. He too are intent on developing, furthering and
expanding relations with the French regime on the same principles and with
the same spirit.

Regarding the time required for the construction of a new nuclear reactor.
1 do not wish to discuss this subject because construction time will be set
in the agreement that will be reached. So far. we have not yet signed a
final agreement with France on that regard.

lraq and the Soviet Union Are intent on Developing Their Cooperation

[Question] Iraq is saying that its relations with the Soviet Union have
improved. what are the indications of this improvement? Has the Soviet
Union resumed execution of the arms deals agreements that had been con-
cluded with it? Does the Soviet Union have new positions on the Iraqi-
lranian war?

[Answer] Regardless of the Soviet Union's former or subsequent position

on the war between Iraq and lran, I am saying that the Iranian regime has
generally been exposed. even more so on the international level. Many coun-
tries in the world. either in their ideological attitudes or in their prac—
tical position oi viewing their interests or their requirements for proper
strategic thinking. no longer in reality view this regime with respect.
Many countries have reconsidered their positions in light of these facts.
One ol these iacts is the steadrastness of our regime. Our regime has sur-
vived and has continued to adhere to friendly relations with friends. It
has maintained its point of view toward enemies, without changes and with-
out. illegal tactical variations.

The Soviet Union has affirmed more than once that it was intent on develo-
ping its relations with lraq in all the areas in which it was cooperating
with lraq before the war. We share the Soviet Union's wishes: we want to
develop relations between our two countries in a balanced manner and in
accordance with the known principles of the revolution.

[Question] My final question was about relations between Iraq and the

50

INIRiOIWHCJAl.lﬂﬂE(HVLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

United States. Iraq is almost the only Arab country that did not resume
diplomatic relations with the United States ever since Iraq suspended dip-
lomatic relations after the 6-Day war in 1967.

There is growing talk about the possibility that diplomatic relations
between Iraq and the United States might be resumed. however, in a state-
ment you made recently you said that this was unlikely at the present time.
were the circumstances of bombing the nuclear reactor the reason for
removing ircm consideration the resumption of diplomatic relations?

_ [Answer] Any action, good or bad, in .1 relationship between two countries
must be measured on a scale. ln all cases, however, we always assume authen-
tic positions that harbor no doubts or ambiguitiess. In conditions of war

ii our relations with any country are poor, we do not improve them. If
relations are good. we preier that they do not worsen. The normal condi-
tions under which a relationship is considered are those of peace. those

that would not yield a poor explanation of the relationship if it were to
be reconsidered.

In all cases we have never said that present relations with the United
States were normal and ought to continue as they are and be suspended for
ever. Having normal relations signifies that our relations with the United
States or with any other country in the world would not be suspended. Abnor-
mal relations are diplomatic relations that are suspended. However, in the
course of our evaluation. our analysis and our studies of all considera-
tions and circumstances. we have not yet determined that having normal
diplomatic relations with the United States would serve our pan-Arab and
national interests. When conditions for normal diplomatic relations with
the United States are available, when such relations are in the national or
pan—Arno interest. we will say this publicly to public opinion, and we will
restore this relationship with the Americans without fear or hesitation.

It was almost 1:30. My interview with him had lasted 3.5 hours. I felt
that I had said everything I had to say and that i had taken enough of
his time to be able to convey his opinions and his impressions to Arab
public opinion. i no longer hoped for more.

The president, however, was still composed and magnanimous. He asked me
jokingly if I was certain that I had asked him all the questions I had
for him.

I thanked him. took my leave and lcl’t. Once again the fall breezes of

Baghdad greeted me. imparting to my limbs a delightful sensation of warmth
and assurance.

I looked out the window oi the car to the side of the road. The Tigris
was flowing proudly and silently. It were as though the river were staying
in step with the course of Baghdad. a historical witness of the city's
tl‘illlslillmiltion into a huge, modern metropolis bustling with life, traffic
and puwt-r in the age oi Saddam liusayn and for the first time in many
centuries.

Death of Single-Party System
Paris JBUNE AFRIQUE in French No 1089, 18 Nov 81 p 22

[Text] After the great hopes engendered by Tunisia'c first pluralist elec-
tions. has come surprise and disarray. How the vote counters could have acted
so outrageously is beyond all understanding. But perhaps the exercise was not
in vain. The opposition was not the only loser. The reign of the single-party
system belongs to the past, as noted by Francois Poli and Habib Boulares (pp 23,

26). And denocracy has certainly taken its first steps. Even if it is not yet
spelled with a capital “D."

[Text] A good number of Tunisians who feel they were swindled in the 1 November
legislative elections have nevertheless not lost their sense of humor.

'ﬁhe balloting," they say, “was like when you use henna. You put the powder

on your skin and it is green; you remove it and it's red!" (An allusion to the
green ballots of the HDS [Socialist Democratic Hove-entl and the red ones of the
National Front, and to the electoral fraud people realized was practiced. See

JEUNE AFRIQUE Nos 1086, 1087 and 1088.)

Not everyone thinks it is amusing, of course. I have even seen women on the
verge of tears: “I quit. I will never vote again!" But the government and the
newspapers with ties to the government continue to proclaim that everything went
off without a hitch. But eygryone knows, and knows that everyone knows. Includ-
ing the people in the PSD, the Destourian Socialist Party, who are in a better
position than anyone to know.

The system could be manipulated at several levels. First of all, before the
voting, through pressure put on the voters. That was applied by those burly
fellows stationed almost everywhere in the proximity of the ballot boxes. One
female voter's testimony: "My children, who are for the opposition, told me:-If

53

FOI4DFFKJA1.USEIMVLY
FOR (WI-“1“. USE ONLY

you vote red, don't come back home! So I took a green ballot. A man who was
there gave me a red one. This is the one you must take. I refused. Be acted
so menacingly that I had to go back without voting."

There could also havebeen fraud before the boxes were opened for counting. It
must be recalled in this connection that each time a voter slips his ballot in-
to the box, a member of the election bureau is supposed to note on a piece of
paper called the "voting list“ that he or she has voted. Shortly before the
voting is over, people know the number of voters who have up to then stayed
home and who doubtless will not come. Members of the bureau may well permit
others to vote in place of those who have not voted. This is one form of the
notorious practice of "stuffing ballot boxes."

To avoid this kind of fraud, the Tunisian election law gives each slate the
right to designate an observer to watch over the voting to insure against irre-
gularities. By withdrawing their observers at midday on 1 November (those who
were able to take their positions), the three opposition groups, whatever justi-
fications may be given for this withdrawal, facilitated possible fraud.

Once the vote counting was finished, each election bureau sent its official re-
port of the results of the balloting to the headquarters of the commission (at
the subprefecture level), the third stage where fraud could take place, by the
simple substitution of false reports for true ones. The commission members in
turn comunicated their results to the governorate; the governors to the minis-
ter of the interior, Hr Driss Guiga, who proclaimed them officially on Tuesday

3 November at 1100 hours, after a delay which has not been fully explained.

Here was the reaction of Ahmed Hestiri, leader of the Socialist Democrats, to

the official count giving his group only 3.28 percent of the votes cast in the
country as a whole: "I accuse the minister of the interior, the governors, and
the commission members of having falsified the results of the voting." One might
note that Mr Hestiri himself only levelled accusations at one minister--Hr Guiga--
doubtless because he believed, as seems to be the case, that the other ministers.
including the prime minister, played the democratic game by the rules. To assume
otherwise would make it verydifficult to explain to the contrary the official
invitation addressed to some 40 foreign journalists who followed the elections

in Tunis, only to conclude unanimously that there had been fraud.

The H0? 11 [Popular Unity Movement] (a faction of the Popular Unity Movement
opposed to Ahmed Ben Salah, former minister of national economic affairs) ob-
tained only 0.81 percent of the votes cast, the Tunisia' Tommunist Party (PCT)
0.78 percent, independents 0.35 percent. Thus the opporition vote amounted in
all to only 5.22 percent. According to the opposition, this figure is unrealis-
tically low. (see separate article.)

It is certain, nonetheless, that even if the H08, thePCT or MU? 11 got as many
votes as might normally have been expected, they would not have threatened the
very wide margin of victory the National Front would have had. So why bother
with fraud? "How did we come to this pass?", many Tunisians are asking. The
answer: by means of a chain of events which perhaps we must recapitulate. He
will start by recalling that the government in Tunisia is Bourguiba and no one
else. Bourguiba feels that in large part he is responsible for bringing the

54

EOR‘OFFKJAI.USE(MVLY

country to its present position. He won independence, liberated the women,
introduced mass education, built a state which bears up well by comparison with
any African country.

All that is unquestioned. But then came the events of 26 January 1978, during
which soldiers fired on rioters and there were deaths. Then cane January 1980:
an attack on the mining town of Gafsa, in the southern part of the country, in
an attempt to destabilize his regime. The operation failed, but it was able to
happen. Thus, something had changed, Bourguiba's political instincts, extremely
well-sharpened, told him the country could no longer be governed in the same way
as before. The Trench left (in particular) continued to underline periodically
that there were too many political detainees in Tunisian prisons. "Tunisia,"
people said, "does not quite thy-e with Chile, but it is close."

The moment had doubtless come to take a step toward real democratization. Mohamed
Hzali was to be the architect of that overture. The prisons were emptied. Oppo-
sition movements cane out of the shadows. The news kiosks sold AL-RA'Y and DEMO-
CRATIE, which openly opposed the regime. On 10 April 1981, the 2d Congress of
the PSD was held in Tunis. Bourguiba gave a speech. It said that: "The

degree of maturity the people have attained, the aspirations of the young peo-
ple, the advantages there are to having all Tunisians participate in decision-
making, all these factors lead us to say that there is no objection to the emer-
gence of national, political and social organizations." There was sustained
applause. And who applauded? The PSD nilitants themselves,.who even went so

far as to ask-—as if they could not get over it--for Bourguiba to repeat what he
had just said. he did so. But right up to the last second, people wondered if
the head of state would say that sentence again. It was not in the original text
of the speech. It had been added later! So there are influences pulling him in
two different directions.

In this country which since independence has been under single-party rule, the
speech was considered important enough to be given considerable international
press coverage. People began to talk about a multiparty system, and about

early pluralist legislative elections. Bourguiba did nothing to discourage it.
Has it not his will? Elections were scheduled. They were to be democratic,

and opposition spokesmen would have access to radio and television. They used

it effectively. If 2 years ago they had said 1 percent of the things they were
now saying, they would have landed in prison! In his palace at Carthage, Bour—
guiba listened. And we understand he did not say a word. But one can still ima-
gine that he might have gotten worried all of a sudden: Are we not going too
fast and too far? he had not forgotten Gafsa and Qadhdhafi. And if one of the
new parties were to fall under the influence of Libya--that subversive Libya that
has more money than it knows what to do with? Perhaps the time has come to slow
things down a bit? Bourguiba in fact decided noput on the brakes, and gave the
necessary instructions for it to be done.

There are no liberals in the Tunisian political elite. The regime has its hard-
core supporters. to use the tine-honored expression. Even the Tunisians do not
know all of them. Democracy, opposition, liberalism, pluralism-these words
leave a kind of bitter taste in their mouths. And when it comes to bringing the
machinery to a halt. they can be counted on. If the head of state should pass

from the scene and a liberal come to power, their future would definitely be

a thing of the past. For that reason, it was of course necessary for the
National Front to win an absolute victory, not merely a very large one. The
legislative elections of 1 November were thus a tactical victory for them.

It remains to be seen whether the results of one election can turn back the
clock. Probabl, the answer is no. Tunisia can no longer be what it has been
in the past. There will be 27 deputies representing the UGTT [Tunisian Gener-
al Federation of Labor]-the main trade union confederation-in the House.
This would have been unthinkable only a year ago! Even if one does not think
them highly representative of the base, it would seem that the base will cer-
tainly be obliged to identify with them. And they will speak out. Could this
be the birth (still far in the future, in all likelihood) of a labor party?
Why not?

Things are not completely ideal, to be sure. Opposition newspapers are pub-
lished, but everyone knows that all it would take would be a little heavyhanded
pressure here and there on the vendors and these papers would be very hard to
find. I had considerable difficulty, a few days ago, getting a copy of AVENIR
(the Socialist Democratic newspaper) in Tunis. AL-RA'Y, the paper put out by
Hassib Ben Ammar, is another opposition organ, and it has had problems of this
sort in the recent past. All the same: despite everything, it was read. No
doubt the step democracy has taken is not a big one--nor even the step it had
hoped to take. But what does the Tunisian proverb say? "A thousand little
steps are worth more than One great leap."

Truth
Paris JEUNE AFRIQUE in French No 1089, 18 Nov 81 p 25

[Text] The opposition, officially credited with 5.22 percent of the total votes
cast in the 23 electoral districts, believes that in reality it garnered 60 to
45 percent of the votes. Official truth versus opposition estimates: "hat is
the real truth? We have at least a few figures from reliable sources: In the
country as a whole the opposition got 25 percent of the vote, and did best in
the town of Keft, where it took 65 percent.

In Tunis, with 103,856 registered voters and 79,505 going to the polls, 17,950
votes were cast. The official figures gave 72,513 votes to Beji Caid Essebsi,
the top candidate on the National Front List, and only 1,603 to Hr Hestiri, head
of the Socialist Democratic Movement list (HDS)—-or less than any of his fellow
candidates. In reality, Hr Hestiri obtained 21,000 votes. In the same electoral
district, the PCT received on the order of 2,500 votes, and MU? II about 1,000
votes. These figures are too low, for they do not take into account the pres-
sures brought to bear on some voters. So they should be considered as being
higher, though obviously it is not possible to be more precise.

Little Steps Toward Democracy
Paris JEUNB AFRIQUB in French No 1089. 18 Nov 81 pp 26-27
[Article by Habib Boulares]

[Text] "This is only the beginning, let us continue the fight," chanted the
youth of France in May 1968. In its own way Tunisia has just been through a
kind of May '68—-irrational, impassioned, exultant and to all appearances just
as disappointing as the original in its tangible results; but the deeper ef-
fects are sure to make themselves felt as the days go by.

In the immediate aftermath of the legislative elections of 1 November 1981,
Tuaisians felt they had been the victim of a cruel joke. In effect, the only
candidates to win election as deputies were representatives of the National
Pront--including the author of these words. What was to be the spectacular
demonstration of a peaceful transformation from an authoritarian political sys-
to: became an embarrassment to those in every camp who had loyally played the
game of nascent democracy. "I am ashamed," one elected official told me on

3 November. It is futile to point out that the National Front was comprised not
only of militants of the PSD (Destouriau Socialist Party) but also of leaders of
the UGTT [Tunisian General Federation of Labor] and independents-the only thing
public opinion both in Tunisia and abroad understood was that no candidate on
any of the other lists was elected.

A 100 percent victory-whether by a front or a party, is not credible. It is
even less so when, as in this specific case, the balloting was marred by inci-
dents and the counting of the votes was not in any way monitored. '1hey are
taking us for inbeciles." was the remark thrown in my face by an angry academic.
who added bitingly, "I am going to become a naturalized Frenchman!" While exces-
sive, that reaction shows the degree of disappointment felt.

During the 2 weeks of the electoral campaign (18—31 October). Tunisians lived

in a dream world. At the start, they did not believe in it. Skeptical. the
voters did not rush to attend public meetings. Then, television viewers began
to see the faces of OppOsition candidates on the little screen. Inhabitants in
remote areas of the country were astonished to see this. Mohamed Harmel, a
Communist, Ahmed Mestiri, a Socialist Democrat, Mohamed Belhadj Amor, of Popular
Unity, were saying things that previously were considered "subversive." They
listened-—on the radio as we11--to people criticizing, analyzing. and dissecting
the government's actions with no holds barred. "These broadcasts alone were
enough to convince me that something had changed in Tunisia," one doctor told
me. "I thought I must be dreaming.“

Suddenly, the campaign came to life. A real campaign. where candidates on all
sides really fought it out. The meetings began to draw larger and larger
crowds. The big-circulation dailies and the opposition newspapers began to
print more of the truth. People tore down the placards of groups they opposed.
People were distributing tracts for their own party atthe exits of meetings
held by others. There were some fistfights. The atmosphere was at once like
a village fair and an important athletic contest where everyone hoped his own

team would win. People mistakenly thought they would be elected, forgetting

that this was only a beginning....A sincere desire for change stirred the Tuni-
sian people. And, contrary to the stereotyped picture of the government on one
side and the people on the other, the latter did not all support the opposition.

One also had to note the social classes attracted by the National Front meetings,
which often drew the poorest people. The PSD apparatus, which over the years had
become a lifeless structure, revived. Militants and cadres who had drifted

away over the last decade came back into service, as if pluralism had cleansed
them of an original sin. Every Tunisian wanted to assume his place, or return
to it, when the political playing field suddenly took on added dimensions.

Young people not even old enough to vote yet ran from one meeting to the next,

to see and hear the candidates compete and serve an apprenticeship in political
struggle. '

In the general euphoria, people tended to forget that though this "happening" was
taking place, it was because the government had agreed to loosen the reins.
Doubtless pluralism within the PSD itself was already a reality, but nothing re-
quired the head of state to move ahead with the early elections. He might just
as well have recognized the parties and-as the opposition was demanding--
allowed the preceding legislature to finish its normal term in November 1986.

Why, under these conditions, was no opposition candidate able to get a seat in
the new parliament? "It is as if someone had lifted the lid of a pot and then
put it immediately back in place," said one embittered jurist.

There was a tendency, in the impassioned climate, to forget the facts of the
situation. At the start, the opposition did not think it would have any suc-
cess at the polls. Their statements prove this. The Tunisian system--in which
people vote for several members on a list, and have the right to split their
vote among candidates from different parties, and the winner is selected in one
round of voting--could not work to the advantage of the opposition unless the
voters played the game of vote-splitting with great precision, in other words
voting for candidates belonging to different lists.

Now on the one hand it was in the interests of the National Front to exhort
Tunisians to vote for all its candidates without discrimination; and on the
other hand the opposition groups had the modest ambition of getting more than
5 percent of the vote so as to obtain legal recognition, and they too were in-
citing the voters to vote a straight party ticket. Finally, the citizens them-
selves showed something of a tendency to support one side or the other unre-
scrvedly, like sports spectators at a game. In short, only an infinitesimal
percentage of the voters exercised their right to split their vote. Under
those conditions, even if they had received 49 percent of the votes nationwide,
the opposition could not have won any deputies. It could do this only if it
obtained a majority in one or more of the electoral districts.

That does not explain the ridiculous figures put out respectively by the opposi-
tion and the Ministry of the Interior. It is not credible that all the lists

competing against the National Front could only muster 5 percent of the vote
between them. The opposition parties made a serious mistake in withdrawing

their observers from the voting bureaus on the day of the halloting-because

of some incidents, numerous to be sure but in any case limited to a few places
around the country. Accounts by foreign journalists were basically confined to
the electoral district of South Tunis. And even there, one could not indict
all the heads of the voting bureaus, since it was in fact the letter from one
of them that Mr Hestiri, the head of the HDS, read at a press conference to
prove the existence of tampering.

Besides, if all the presidents of the voting bureaus had been implicated, how
could one explain the fact that in some towns, when the ballot boxes were opened,
it was discovered that there was a substantial number of votes for the opposi-
tion. even though there had not been any observers? By keeping their observers
in place, the opposition groups would have been able-~despite the incidenta--to
increase the number of places, particularly in the urban centers, where they ob-

tained some success. It was in any case a good lesson for those groups in the
future. '

As for the government, its conduct was very ambiguous. A 75 percent victory for
the National Front, for example, would have been viewed by the whole world as

a great victory for President Bourguiba. Think about that! After 25 years in
power, sharing that power with no one, after multiple crises, some of which
resulted in bloodshed, three-fourths of the voters still have faith in the head
of state! Yes. But, in the government view, that would have revealed publicly
the existence of 25 percent who were dissatisfied. Por a system accustomed to
being obeyed, that was too much to be swallowedin the first pluralist election.
One should not be deceived: The Tunisiana did not vote for a particular person,
not for a particular program. The journalists who followed the campaign noted
that the party programs did not differ greatly from the program of the National
Front.

Tunisians voted for or against the system in place. A vote along ideological
lines would have indicated the direction unwhich the voters want to see their
society evolve. A homogenous vote of either affirmation or rejection pushes
the government toward opting for the path of guided democracy, a path which

it preferred from the start. This is in contrast to what happened in Senegal
or Ivory Coast, where the government made a deliberate effort to bring new men,
if not opponents, into the parliaments.

But it remains true all the same that something has happened, something that
seemed impossible only 18 months ago. We have moved from monolithism to
pluralism. The results of the election were clearly less than what had been
hoped, but they did confirm a fact that will become increasingly evident. By
the very nature of things a coalition government is now in power in the new
assembly. The trade union deputies, though they do not represent an incor-
porated party, are not a part of the PSD. They are autonomous. They will
probably have their own parliamentary group and defend the program of their
congress. Outside the governmental institutions, another party has legal exis-
tence: the Communists. A third, the Socialist Democrats, has good prospects of
legalization in the near future. And one must not forget the newspapers of the
various factions which are vigorously expressing the feelings of the public.
This is a major advance. one which must be consolidated.‘

The advance toward democracy has not been aborted. The gears have been engaged,
but need to be put in motion. Democracy does not just happen. It is something
that must be practiced daily. Everyone--both government and opposition-who
wants to see it become deeply rooted in the country must make it his own.
