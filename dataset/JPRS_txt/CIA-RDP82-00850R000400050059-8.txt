LIST OF TOP 100 BUSINESS FIRMS 1N MACHINERY SALES FOR FY 1980 COMPILED
Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIHBUN in Japanese 29 Jul 81 p 6

[Text] Machine Tools Group Makes Advance; Makes Inroads Into Top 100 Positions;
Sales Volume Increases 25.5 Percent

Business showing of Japan's powerful machinery firms in 1980 has shown remarkable
growth thanks to the "machinery boom." Nihon Keizsi Shimhunsha has carried out

"the second top 100 machinery firms ranking" of Japan's powerful machinery firms
(including the consolidated firms). According to the results of this investiga-
tion, the total 1980 sales volume of the top 100 firms among those who responded
reached 13,683,700,000,000 yen. exceeding the actual results of the top 100 firms
of the previous year by 25.5 percent. The machinery firms are said to have sung
the praise of this unprecedented machinery market activity. Moreover, the total
sales volume of the top 100 firms as a percentage of the total sales of Japan's

machinery and tool wholesalers (based on the commercial statistics and the com-

mercial movement statistics) junped from 22.2 percent in 1979 to 26.3 percent in
1980; clearly indicating that concentration of top ranking firms was in progress.

In order to grasp the actual state of the current machinery business circle, 386
powerful machinery firms (refer to the "method of investigation" for the method

of selecting the subject firms for study) were chosen and an investigation was
carried out by means of a questionnaire including, among others, the questions

concerning 1979 and 1980 sales volumes and the prospect of 1981 sales.

The machinery chosen as the subject for study included general industrial
machinery, tools, parts, precision light machines, ships, and railroad rolling
stocks. Automobiles, electronic computers, household appliances, and general
electric machines were not included in the study this time.

According to the results of investigation. the total sales volume of top 100
firms in 1980 amounted to 13,683,700,000,000 yen which was 25.5 percent over the
1979 sales volume of 10,902,600.000,000 yen. In spite of dullness in the con-

struction machinery business due to holdbsck on public investment and a $10
billion setback in plant export due to worsening circumstances in 1980, domestic

demand and export of machine tools, precision machines, tools and parts experi-
enced an unprecedentedly favorable activity, so that a significant growth was
shown as a whole.

FOR 0511(1AI.USEGDNLV
Based on the "first top 100 machinery firms ranking" carried out in September
last year, the 1980 sales volume was projected to grow 16.7 percent over 1979.
The actual 1980 sales results far exceeded this prediction, indicating that the
activity of Japan's mchinery firm was better than expected.

Moreover, based on those firms which responded to the question about 1981 sales
forecast, the 1981 planned sales volume will rise 12.4 percent over 1980.

Reacting to the very high growth rate in 1980, the anticipated growth rate is
somewhat lower, but it still represents two-digit high growth rate. Except for

a concern felt by a portion of the firm about the wane of the machinery boom
toward the latter half of 1981, the sales forecast is strong overall.

As expected. the top 10 positions of the 1980 top 100 firm ranking included 9
large consolidated fires. wreover, the 9th through the 20th positions were led
by K. Mattori 6 Co. Near the top were five sales firms affiliated with Yamr
Agricultural Machinery, Shinko Shoji, Citizen Shoji, and Cannon.

Pbreover, carpeted with the 1979 top 100 firm ranking, the fact that firms deal-
ing in favorable lines of machine tools rose in ranking was quite conspicuous.
Yamzen rose from lloth to 11th position, while Gomiya rose from 31st to '28th
position, and Kanematsu Gosho Machine Tool rose from 33rd to 29th position.

8esides these, Mitsui Machine Tools, Katsuyama Machinery, and Yachiyoda Industry
also made an outstanding advance.

0n the other hand, those firms dealing mainly in dull construction mchinery,
including Makemichi Machinery Industry, Narazaki Industry, Kyushu Construction
Machinery Sales, and Itoman each dropped approximately 10 positions in ranking.
Black and white were clearly determined by the type of machinery dealt with.
Those firms which were ranked below 101st in 1979 and were included in the top
100 in 1980 included Beybold and Muranaks Medical lnstrmnt. Conversely, those
firms which were dropped included Nippon Scientific Machinery and Tominaga
Industry.

Method of Investigation

This investigation was carried out on 386 powerful machinery firms chosen from
among Japan's 69,1097 machinery and tool wholesalers based on the following
criteria: 1) Listed (stock) enterprise, 2) Member enterprise of Japan Machinery
Iwort Association, 3) "Corporation income 50,000 ranking-v-Machinery and Tool

wholesaler" cowiled by Nikkei Business. The questionnaire included, among
others, questions concerning sales volume of all departments dealing in machinery
and the kinds of machinery handled as of 15 July.

In this investigation, the range of "machinery" was limited to the general
machinery (including plant, wind and hydropower nchinery, cheaical machinery,

boiler and internal coubustion engines, transportation and load-handling machinery,
machine tools, ntal work machinery, wood work machinery, fiber machinery,
hydraulic machinery, food machinery, printing machinery, construction machinery,
packaging machinery, agricultural machinery, air-conditioning machinery, and

other general industrial machinery), tools and parts (including bearings, valves,
gears, screws, springs, tools, and other), precision light aachinery (watches,

optical instruments, cameras, sawing machine, medical instruments, business office
machines, and nasurement instrument), ships, and railroad rolling stocks.

Growth Supported by the Popularity of NC, Yachiyoda and Reybold Made Rank;
Seaiconductors and 0A Related Firm Give Good Fight

Sales Volume Growth Rate

Favorable conditions for machinery firm,dealing in machine tools was outstanding
from the results of this investigation. Yachiyoda Industry, Beybold, and Hitsui

Machine tools which were near the top of the 1980 sales volume growth rate rank-

ing, are specialty firm dealing in machine tools. The reason why these machine

tool specialty firm did so well in 1980 was because there was a great desire to

invest in equipment held by the manufacturers here and abroad, and to save labor

from introduction of NC (numerically controlled) uchine tools into their produc-
tion process.

Moreover, Tokyo Electron, which experienced a favorable sales climate of send.-
conductor manufacturing equipment which constituted the driving force of "micro-
couputer revolution," and J . Ozswa & Co, which dealt in business machines which
led the "0A age." were among the top ranking, sensitively reflecting the market
activity of the business world. Large firm such as c. Itoh 6 Go and Suaitomo
Shoji Keisha have also expanded their sales through their powerful sales net-
work”: here and abroad. Meyer, Chori Company, which came in first on account
of a surge in plant orders, and Nissho-Iwai Aerospace, which came in second
because of favorable sales r f aerospace machinery, are considered to have
erperienced temorary growth. They are expecting a reduction in sales volume
in 1981.

Inactivity in the sales of construction Inchinery as a result of slowdown in the
public works and dullness in sales of agricultural machinery due to reduced
interest in buying by the farmers influenced by the cool sumr last year
resulted in the fact that sales volume of the firm dealing in this mchinery
could not grow. This was another feature which was shown very clearly by the

' results of this investigation.

Increasing Foreign Dependency; C. Itch 6 Co, Chori, and Richimen Co Have Concern
Over Friction in the Field

mchinery export occupies approximately 60 percent of Japan's total export (1980
Customs statistics). It constitutes the main breadwinner who is indispensable
for paying the cost of~iq>orting the raw eaterial and fuel such as oil and iron
ores. In this investigation, we also requested the export volume and consent in
relation to machinery export from a total of 27 firms, the vanguard of machinery
firm whose export rate was more than 20 percent, in order to have an understand-

ing of the 1980 export picture.

Among these 27 firms, there were 17 whose export rate was also more than 20 per-
cent in the previous year. And, 12 of the 17 belonged to the ”export dependent
type" whose export growth rate exceeded its overall growth rate. Ihe majority
of the large consolidated firm increased the sales volume of their machinery
departments by increasing export. m1. grOup was led by c. Itoh & Co which
registered a very high export rate of nearly 80 percent.

On the other hand, those firms among the 27 which increased the sales volume by

expanding their domestic sales authored only seven including Kinsho-hataich‘i Co,
Toyota Commerce, and Mitsubishi Corporation. Machinery export could become

"sparks" which ignite the trade friction in the Euroamerican countries, and the
machinery firm heavily in export are conscientiously taking appropriate counter-

measures such as "ewhasizing technology export" (Kinsho-Hataichi) and "backing up
the advance of manufacturers in the field" (Hitsui Corporation).

ENERGY-SWIM SHETING TECHNOLOGY--Shows Aluminium K.K., a major aluminum roller-
processor, has developed a high-purity aluminum smelting method that enables a
20 per cent reduction in energy cost compared to the conventional electrolytic
cell smelting process. The new smelting method, labelled Corjunal, is based on
the principle that higher-purity aluminum first solidifies during the melting
process. It uses no electricity but fuel oil for melting aluminum materials.
Shows Aluminium already has built a 250-ton-month1y capacity pilot plant at its
Sakai works and is scheduled to start building a mass production plant this fall
for completion next spring. The plant will be capable of producing 2,500 tons
yearly of high-purity aluminum ingots. Upon start-up of the new plant, Shows
Alminium will become the No. 2 producer of high-purity aluminul ingots in
Japan after Sumitomo Aluminim Smelting Co. [Text] [Tokyo JAPAN BCOMIC JOURNAL
