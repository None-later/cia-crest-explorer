[Article by “PR Minister of Foreign Trade Yendongiyn Ochir: "Fifty Years of Foreign
Trade Monopoly“]

[Text] The objective course of development of history created conditions which en-
abled the Hongolian people, guided by the ideas of the Great October Revolution, to
prepare for and carry out the victorious People's Revolution of 1921. This opened
up a highroad to this country's economic and cultural rebirth.

Imediately following the victorious revolution, the people's government comenced
the productive effort of transforming and boosting the. backward economy. It had
been entirely in the hands of foreign couercial-usurer capital. Therefore ex-
pulsion of the latter constituted one of the main tasks facing the people's govern-
ment following the victory of the revolution.

The first steps taken in this direction were revision of the official exchange rates
on the foreign currencies in circulation in our country, repudiation of debts to
foreign businessmen, and establishent of customs control over the import and ex-
port of goods.

As we know, V. I. Lenin saw as one of the important features of socialist foreign
trade its governnentel character, nationalization and centralization in the hands
of the proletarian state. Proceeding from Leninist theses and taking into account
this country's specific conditions, the Government of Mongolia decided that a co-

operative structure was the lost expedient form of nationalization under those con-
ditions.

The first popular mutual assistance cooperatives were established on 16 December
1921, with the task of forcing foreign co-ercial firms and private businessmen out
of the domestic market. The total number of shareholders of these cooperatives in-
creased 60-fold in five years, total shareholder capital increased 24-fold, and
volume of commerce -- 332-fold. In spite of this fact, initially foreign capital
continued to doninate the domestic market. In 19210 its share anounted to almost
80 percent of the nation's imports and almost 78 percent of its exports.

In connection with this, the First Great People's aural, convened that same year,
issued a directive calling for preparations for and gradual implementation of a
foreign trade monopoly. This was a complex business and required considerable
caution and preparatory work.

The mutual assistance cooperatives, continuing the cOuntry'stole national trade-
economic organizations, became the principal support of the people's government is
the designated measures. They also played a significant role in establishment and
development of trade-economic relations between Mongolia and the USSR.

The first Mongolian-Soviet trade agreement, grounded on principles of proletarian
internationalism, mutual benefit, equality of rights and respect of sovereignty,
was signed in 1932. External economic relations with the Soviet Union were of great
importance for eliminating foreign commercial-neuter capital in Mongolia and thus
for the establishment of a national economy and trade.

Pursuant to the agreement, a number of Soviet trade organizations worked in close co-
operation with Mongolian leople's cooperatives. In addition, Mongolian-Soviet
joint-stock companies were formed in Mongolia. They promoted strengthening of the
people's cooperatives and staffing of socialist trade with national cadres. An es-
pecially important role here was played by experienced Soviet trade specialists,

who lent us inestimable assistance in this area.

A major measure by party and government in the area of the country's economic
transformation was establishment of a Mongolian Trade-Industrial Bank in June 1926
with the assistance of the Soviet Union. Its principal task was to promote
development of trade and industry in this country and to strengthen money circula-
tion and performance of state budget financial transactions. The bank was also of
particular significance for deepening economic relations between the MP8 and the
USSR.

In connection with expansion of trade with the Soviet Union and develop-ent of na-
tional commerce, in 1927 the people's mutual assistance cooperatives were trans-
formed into a Mongolian consumer cooperative.

These and other measures, in particular a currency reform and establishment of a
stable national currency -- the tugrik - constituted important stages in the
struggle for economic independence and prepared the conditions for introduction of

a foreign trade monopoly. The same aim was pursued by the government's decision
calling for duty-free import of goods to boost agriculture, industry and transporta-
tion, and forbidding the import and export of certain other goods, and on so—called
special monopolies, which were granted to cooperative organizations pertaining to
procurements, export and marketing. All this promoted enhancement of the role of
the public sector in procurements, foreign trade and domestic commerce, and led to

a shrinking of the sphere of activity of foreign capital.

As a result, by the end of 1929 Mongolian cooperatives had essentially gained a
monopoly right to procurement and marketing of goods abroad, as well as supplying
the public with consumer durables and foodstuffs.
A decree calling for the adoption of a foreign trade monopoly throughout the entire
territory of the MPR was issued by the government in December 1930. It signified

concentration of all external economic activity in the hands of the state. Pursuant
to this decree, licenses were henceforth required for the export and import of goods
both by privately owned, state and cooperative organizations. They were also in-
troduced for transit goods. Free access to Nongolia's domestic market was shut off
entirely to foreign capital, and the decree enabled the people's state to transact
foreign trade operations in the most favorable area for the country and to subor-
dinate them to the interests of the national economy. The planning component was
becoming considerably stronger in distribution of goods among the general public.

Introduction of a foreign trade monopoly made it possible substantially to increase
sources of domestic accumulations essential for the creation and development of in-
dustry, transportation and agriculture, and for boosting the people's material and
Cultural living standards. Formerly these funds had been totally removed from
Nongolia in the form of commercial profits.

In response to this emirely legitimate action taken by the sovereign Mongolian state,
all countries except for the USSR ceased trade relations with the NPR. In connec-
tion with this, for a period of 20 years the Soviet Union was our sole foreign
economic partner. During all these years it conscientiously carried out its inter-
national duty, supplying the NPR with the goods which were essential for the
economy and the population.

V. I. Lenin considered a state monopoly to be the only acceptable form of conduct of
foreign trade in a socialist nation, since it alone ensures maximum utilization of
this sector in the interests of building socialism and helps protect a country's
economic and political independence.

The first industrial enterprises,transportation, trade and other economic organiza-
tions in Nongolia, created with the assistance of the Soviet Union for the most part
as joint Nongolian-Soviet enterprises, were subsequently transferred to full owner-
ship by the NPR. They played an important role in development of our nation's

economy.

By 1940 trade between Our countries was double the 1935 figure. The Soviet Union
was fully meeting the requirements of the population of the NPR in such products
as sugar, tea, dalemba [a type of cotton cloth], Dunza tobacco, etc.

Development of certain branches of Mongolian industry enabled our country, in ad-
dition to increasing export of meat and livestock, hides, wool and furs, to export a
number of new items to the USSR, food products in particular.

Trade between the NPR and USSR continued growing during the years of the Great

Patriotic war. In 1965 trade between Nongolia and the Soviet Union was almost
double the 1939 figure.

The end of world war II, establishment of a popular democratic system in a number of
countries in Europe and Asia, and formation of a world socialist system created
favorable conditions for further expansion and deepening of Nongolia's external
economic relations. At the beginning of the 1950's it established trade relations
with all socialist countries. Trade began to be conducted on a long-term basis
with the overwhelming majority of these countries.

when the NPR joined the UN in 1961 and cm in 1962, its prestige in the world arena rose
to an even greater degree, and its trade-economic relations broadened and deepened.

Active participation in CEHA activities, and in particular in implementation of the
Comprehensive Program. created favorable conditions for intensive mobilization and
utilization of internal resources, for acceleration of the historic process of gradual

drawing togetherandequalization of the level of economic development of the “PR with
that of the other CEHA member nations.

Considerable prospects for an accelerated upsurge of the national economy of the “PR
opened up in connection with elaboration and implementation of long-range specific
programs of cooperation (DTsPS). An important role is also to be played by the
country's draft Future Directions of Socioeconomic Development for the Period up to
1990. It prescribes creation, with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the other
brother nations, of a national economic complex which is optimal for the NPR, including
a structure of basic branches and sectors which would ensure their dynamic and inter-

linked development and would lead to attaining a high level of societal labor
productivity.

The groundwork for such a complex is being laid in our country in the course of so—
cialist industrialization. Taking account of its specific features and the present
level of international socialist division of labor, the HPRP [Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party] and the Government of the NPR consider it advisable to con-
centrate manpower and resources on development of those branches and sectors for which
our country offers the most favorable natural and economic conditions. They include

first and foremost the fuel-energy industry, the mining and mineral processing in-
dustry, as well as agriculture.

Conatituting the principal form of economic relations between the “PR and other
countries, foreign trade provides a substantial percentage of state budget revenues.

It is steadily growing (Table 1), which attests to this country's increased export
capabilities and import requirements.

Thanks to successful implementation of tasks assigned by the HPRP pertaining to
transforming this country from an agrarian-industrial into an industrial-agrarian
country, and active participation in international socialist division of labor, posi-
tive changes have taken place in recent years in the commodity structure of our ex-
ports and imports (Table 2). This has been fostered by an increase in Our country's

industrial output and movement on-stream of new enterprises built with the finan-
cial and technical assistance of the Soviet Union and the other CEHA member na-
tions, which has enabled the MPR to expand year by year the volume and variety of
finished manufactured products and semimanufactures which are exported to these
countries. Today Mongolia exports to brother countries such new categories of
goods as carpets. sheepskin and fur items, canned meats, biological preparations,
animal tankage, tin concentrate, etc.

Of great importance for deepening economic cooperation between the NPR and the

USSR and implementation of the Comprehensive Program is the Agreement on Economic
and Technical Cooperation in construction of the Brdenet Joint Copper-Molybdenum
Mining and Concentration Combine, which was signed in February 1973. when this in-
dustrial giant, one of the 10 largest enterprises of its type in the world, reaches
full capacity, this country's gross industrial output and export rescurces will
increase substantially. Our import capabilities will also increase correspondingly.

An important event in the further development of highly productive relations
between the NPR and the USSR was the signing in October 1980 of a new long-term
trade agreement between our countries, covering the period 1981-1985. According

to this agreement, the volume of mutual trade between our countries will increase-
by approximately 50 percent over the figure for the last five-year plan. we attach
particular importance to this agreement which, just as preceding agreements, will
play an exceptionally iaportant role in successful attainment of our national
economic targetsand in boosting the people's living standards.

MPR foreign trade has accoaplished a great and complex journey in the last 50 years.
Lenin's teaching on a state foreign trade monopoly is just as valid today. It

plays an important role in our successful fulfillment of five-year plans of
development of the national economy and culture as well as achievement of the

program target of the HPRP pertaining to building the material and technological
foundation of socialism in this country.

The HPR presently trades with close to 30 different countries. The CEHA member
nations account for more than 96 percent of this country's total foreign trade,
with the USSR accounting for approximately 80 percent. A number of goods manufac-

tured by Mongolian industry have been awarded gold medals and certificates at in-
ternational fairs and exhibits.

Constituting an organic component of the national economy of the NPR, foreign
trade is developing in close interaction with other branches and sectors. Foreign
economic relations are being increasingly more extensively utilized for speeding
up the development of productive resources. Modern, advanced equipment is being
purchased abroad on an increasing scale for Mongolian industry, agriculture, and
transportation. Foreign trade channels are being more extensively utilized for

accomplishing the main economic task -- improvement in the material and cultural
living standards of our urban and rural working people.

Our country's working people, who are presently standing shock-work labor watch
in honor of the 18th Congress of the HPRP and the 60th anniversary of the People's

Revolution, are achieving new labor successes for the sake of the prosperity of
our homeland .

[Text] The 60th anniversary of the victory of the People's Revolution in Hongolia
is being celebrated on 11 July 1981.

During the years of the people's rule, the Mongolian People's Republic has been
transformed fron a country of backward nomadic livestock raising to an agrarian-
industrial nation, having accoqlished for the first tine in history the transition
from feudalism to socialise while coupletely bypassing the capitalist stage of
development.

The Mongolian people, under the guidance of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party, have achieved impressive success in building the naterial and technological
foundation of socialise, in increasing this country's economic potential, and in in—
proving societal relations.

The living standards of the working people are steadily rising on the basis of
dynamic growth of the economy.

The figures presented belov characterize the successes of building socialism in the
“PR.

HANGAY THERMAL HATER RESOURCES AND POSSIBLE USE

Moscow VODNYYE RESURSY in Russian No 3, Mar 81 (manuscript received 28 Nov 79)
pp 182-186

[Article by V. P. Shipachev: "0n the Thermal Water Resources of the Hangsy Zone of
the NPR and Possibilities of Their Utilisation"]

[Text] Consumtion of clay cf wins types is dolbling approximately every 20 years
(3). This is causing an extremely intensive consumption of fossil fuels -- coal,
natural gas, and petroleum products, reserves of which are declining sharply as a
consequence of this. Therefore one can well understand the endeavor to find new
reliable and economical sources of energy, utilization of which will make it pos-
sible to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, especially oil. In recent years
the attention of investigators has been drawn toward such promising and accessible
types of energy as solar, wind, and especially geothermal energy.

The fairly widespread distribution of thermal waters, stability of their conditions,
relative simplicity of exploitation and large quantity of heat which can be ex-
tracted from a comparatively limited operations area (group of wells, springs)
enables us to view this type of thermal energy as a highly promising thermal energy
raw material. Characteristic of geothermal energy sources is continuous natural
renewal, as well as uniformity of flow during operation. In addition, in most in-
stances thermal waters possess certain medicinal properties, which offers the pos-
sibility of utilizing them for curative purposes. Frequently valuable chemical
products can be obtained from thermal waters alongside heat: boron, bromine, iodine,
sulfur, ammonia, silicon, etc (5-7, 9).

Experience in utilizing heat from deep within the earth has shown the economic ad-
vantage of exploiting this source of energy (3). As a rule thermal water reserves
are sufficient to recoup all production costs in a comparatively short period of
time and subsequently to generate substantial profit.

Fossil fuel reserves are fairly limited in the Mongolian People's Republic, but at
the same time there are areas with numerous spots where thermal waters emerge at the
surface, with temperatures ranging from 40-50 to 80-92’0. No sources of geothermal
steam connected with zones of contemporary volcanism have yet been discovered.
However, if deep wells are drilled in those areas where thermal waters occur. one
can expect to bring water to the surface at a temperature of above lOO'C.

The cost of producing geothermal water in the USSR (with average well depths of'
600 m, a flow rate of 15 l/sec and water temperature of 60°C) is 1.2 hop/m3, while
the cost of producing a gigacalory of heat is 80 kopecks (1971 figures). In the
NPR, with geothermal waters occurring for the most part in fissures and seams,

well depth will average 400-1000 m, while water temperature may prove to be 100'C
and higher, as already noted. The cost of producing a gigacalory of heat will
average 1-1.2 rubles, and water - not more than 5-6 hop/m3. If we compare these
figures with current rates on heat produced by boiler houses fired by coal, natural
gas, and petroleum products, one readily notes that the cost of heat from.subter-
ranean waters in promising areas nowhere exceeds current rates. In other words,

production of geothermal water is entirely warranted from an economic standpoint
(7, 8).

According to available survey materials and the literature, there are a number of
folded systems in the western and central parts of the NPR, particularly in the
Hangay zone, in which latent volcanic activity is apparently occurring. Fairly
numerous signs of geothermal sources have been discovered here on the southern and
northern slopes of the ﬂangay Range. Some of these sites are used by the local
populace for therapeutic purposes.

The type of all geothermal waters is for the most part sodium hydrocarbonate-
sulfate, with mineralization of 0.16-0.42 g/l, pH 8.65. Gas composition is 80—92
percent nitrogen, whereby the nitrogen is of atmospheric origin, although in some
instances it may originate at considerable depths (2, 4). Oxygen content varies
from 2 to 14 percent. Hydrogen sulfide, in the form of hydrosulfide, is encountered
in almost all hot springs, but its content does not exceed 3-5 mg/l, rarely reach-
ing as high as 13-17 mg/l. The origin of the hydrogen sulfide involves for the most
part oxidation of sulfides dispersed in intrusive rocks and zones of tectonic dis-
turbances. Radon content in the waters ranges from 0.4 to 52 Hache units (from 2

to 188 eman), while carbon dioxide is as a rule not present. Ilhere are a number

of trace elements in the composition of the majority of described hot springs.

The age of all thermal waters, according to (1), ranges from 0.5 to 6.9 million
years. The fairly wide age range attests to the fact that the hydrogeologic condi-
tions of formation of these waters differ, in spite of the seeming similarity of
geologic-structural peculiarities - almost all thermal water sources are associated
with granite intrusions broken by large tectonic disturbances. This in turn at-
tests to the fact that the temperature conditions of each area are formed primarily
under the influence of postvolcanic foci. Under favorable conditions infiltration
waters, filtering through fault zones, approach these foci, become heated and then,
in more weakened locations, rise to the surface in the form of springs. Areas of
intersection of differing-trend fault systems offer the most favorable conditions
for such waters to reach the surface. The fact that these waters have a low level

of radioactivity excludes the possibility that the water was heated by radioactive
decay deep under the surface.

Certain manifestations of neotectonic movements evidently play a significant role in
the formation of hot springs. Evidences of this include comparatively recent (1905,

1957) powerful earthquakes and, as a consequence of this, a rise in the flow rate
and temperature of some springs (2, 6).

As of 1977, more than 330 mineral springs have been discovered on the territory of
the NPR, but only 55 of these, or 17 percent, are hot springs. Only 18 of these
have a temperature of between 00 and 92°C (see figure), while no more than eight

are being exploited in an organized manner (spas, hydropathic establishments), There
is no doubt, however, that the degree of exploitation of hot springs in the NPR will
increase substantially in the near future, in connection with the considerable in-
crease in world market prices on energy raw materials. Probably hot geothermal
waters will be utilized primarily in Dayan Hongor, Arbayheer, Tsetserleg, and
certain somons in the vicinity of which hot springs have been discovered. In partic-
ular, the Shargaljuut, Bagashargaljuut geothermal waters and deep hot geothermal
waters within the town proper can be utilized for Bayan Bangor. Rough preliminary
calculations indicate that Shargal ut can supply Bayan Honsor. without detriment

to the development of this spa, at least 3700 m3 daily of water at a temperature of
70°C. which corresponds to annual thermal rescurces of 6 x 10‘ Goal of heat. Final-
ly, with successful prospecting for geothermal water right in Dayan Bangor. it is
possible to produce 6300 m3/day of water at temperature of 90°, which corresponds to
annual thermal reserves of 11.1 x 10A Gcal. Thus it is possible to produce ap-

proximately 12,300 m3/day of geothermal water with an annual thermal resource volume
of 25.8 x 104 Goal.

the heating season amount to 5.6 x 10‘ Gcal, at 3.5 Gcal per capita (3, 8, 9). 0r
according to another variant: approximately 15 liters per day of geothermal water
at a temperature of 60-70‘ are needed to heat 1 m2 of living space, and 1,760 In3
per day to heat the entire town. Including hot water supply, the town's total re-
quirements will be 2600 m3/day of water at a temperature of not below 60'c. Geo-
thermal water resources are considerably greater than this figure and, consequently,
considerable reserves remain for successful development of large-scale industrial
and agricultural production in the Bayan-Khongor area.

Employing the most reliable sources, we calculated the annual quantity of heat in
gigacalories and determined the volume of lignite equivalent to this heat (see
table). The existing volume of heat totaled 168,000 Gcal, which is equivalent to
64,400 tons of lignite. At the same time, according to data from geologic-
hydrogeologic investigations, taking into accOunt the results of drilling ex-
ploratory wells, we determined the potential future increase in the thermal re-
sources of each site. For example, artesian-flow water at a temperature of 52°
(as compared with 38° in the spring proper) was obtained from a depth of only

37 meters in well No 7 at the Khudzhir site; with pumping, the flow amounted to
3.3 1/sec, while flow in the spring does not exceed 0.8 l/sec (a, 9). By drilling
3-4 wells to a depth of 200-300 meters, one can tap the basic "stream" of geo-
thermal waters, and thus the geothermal resources of this site can be increased
aeveralfold. Anticipated geothermal resources thus amount to 18,180 Gcal/year.
Similar calculations of geothermal resources were performed for all other sites
(637,080 Gcal, or 189,000 tons of coal). At the same time, as is indicated by
practical experience and the study of hot springs, thermal reserves determined
according to the results of spring flow alone prove to be 20-30 times greater
following exploratory drilling (3). If we approach the matter from this stand-
point and increase the thermal resources of each of the 18 sites only 20-fold,
the total amount of heat will run 2,775,440 Gcal, which is equivalent to
1,206,700 tons of lignite.
