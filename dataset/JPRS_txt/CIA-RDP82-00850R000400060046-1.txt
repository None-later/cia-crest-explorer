DETECTION AND MEASUREMENT OF NARROW BAND RADIO SIGNAL FREQUENCY. AGAINST

[Article by A.S. Gurevich and 6.8. Nakhmanson]

[Text] The analysis of a narrow band radio signal and a
narrow normal random process by means of an acoustical opto-
electronic spectrum analyzer is treated. Expressions are
derived for the detection characteristics and the statistical
characteristics of estimates of the signal frequency for the
case of reception against a background of external noise and
internal interference from the opto-electronic system of the
spectrum analyzer.

Increasing attention is being devoted to acoustical opto-electronic devices

[1—4] and others at the present time in the design of optical system for inform-
ation processing. Such devices are acoustical opts-electronic spectrum analyzers
(ACES). which take the form of a combination of an acoustical Optical processor
(i0?) and an opto-electronic (OBS), which perform the simultaneous analysis of

the received signals in a wide range of frequency in real time. In this case, the
quality of the analysis of the received signals (the detection characteristics,
the precision of the measurement of the signal spectrum parameters) depends sub-
stantially on the impact of external and internal noise. One of the methods of
improving signal analysis quality is the choice of the appropriate circuit con-
figuration for the onto-electronic system.

The reception of a narrow band radio signal and a narrow band random process
against a background of internal and external noise by an acoustical opto-
electronic spectrum analyser is treated in this paper, where the circuit of the
analyzer is shown in Figure l. The detection characteristics and the ultimate
measurement precision for the center frequency of the spectrum of the received
signals are analyzed.

It is presupposed in expressions (3)-(6) and the subsequent discussion that the
duration of s(t) considerably exceeds the time it takes the signal to pass through
the aperature of the ultrasonic light modulator, and the analysis is made for the
case of complete filling of the light modulator.

The mean value of the interference component <I,,(u,v.t)>, as follows from expres-
sion (5). is a steady-state quantity and can be compensated in subsequent opto-
electronic processing at the output of the opto-electronic transducer [4]. For
this reason, it can be assumed in the follouing that it is equal to zero without
losing any generality.

The conversion of optical signals to electrical ones, as was indicated above, is
accomplished in the (E. n) plane by means of the photodetectors of the

To illustrate the results, we shall consider the reception of a square—wave

centrated in the vicinity of the frequency so, against a background of white
noise with a spectral density of No and the internal noise of the opto-electronic
system with a spectral density of am. It is seemed in this case that the opto-
electronic systen contains 100 working channels, broken down into 10 grasps, in
which case, if it is considered that the spectral noise density along the entire
frequency is constant, the threshold level at the output of the working channel

The curves for the detection probability Ydet are shown in Figures 2a, b and c

the external and internal noise power and the false alarm probability P£,a_. the
solid curves correspond to the reception of a determinate signal, while the
dashed curves apply to the random process. It can be seen from the nature of the
curves that the detection probability increases with an increase in the signal]

interference power at the input). In the case of an unchanged signal/noise
ratio Qnoise' an increase in It leads to a reduction in the output signal/noise
ratio, and correspondingly to a decrease in the detection probability. With a
reduction in the false alarm probability, the level of the threshold rises, and

for this reason. to retain a specified detection probability. it is necessary to
increase the signal power.

The curves for the relative bias in the estimate of the frequency <f - f0 >fo

and the dispersion ozlfﬁ are shown in Figures 3a, b and c as a function of Q0
for values of k and Pf.a.. It follows from the nature of the curves in

Figures 2c and 3a that the value of the frequency estimate bias depends substant-
ially on the false alarm probability and the ratio of the external and internal
noise powers. In this case. when k > 10, the value of the bias falls off with an
increase in the signal/noise ratio. As follows from the nature of the curves in
Figures 3b and 3c. the value of the frequency estimate dispersion has a sharply
pronounced maximum, which shifts with an increase in k to the region of greater
signal/noise ratios. This can be explained in the following manner: with an
increase in the signal power (when the useful signal power is considerably less
than the external noise power), the noise component of the intensity at the input
to the opto-electronic syst n, which is due to the interaction of the signal and
the external noise. increas-s more rapidly than does the useful component of the
intensity and the value of the frequency estimate dispersion increases. In step
with the useful signal canpoents starting to exceed the interference components,
the level of the dispersion reaches a maximum and thereafter begins to fall off.

.220 ”/0

In this case, the greater the external noise power (k increases). the greater
the signal/noise ratio at which the maximum of the dispersion is achieved. When
the false alarm probability is reduced (i.e., the threshold level increased), the
power of the interference spikes decreases, and for this reason, the level of the
maximum value of the estimate dispersion is reduced. As calculations demonstrate,
the nature of the curves of the statistical characteristics of the estimates of
the number of the frequency interval to which the received signal belongs, is
similar to the behavior of the statistical characteristics of the estimate of the
frequency of the signals being analyzed, and therefore, these functions are not
given here.

PRECISE MEASURING 0F RADIO SIGNAL CARRIER FREQUENCY AT OUTPUT 0F ACOUSTICAL-
OPTICAL FREQUENCY GATE IN PRESENCE OF EXTERNAL ADDITIVE INTERFERENCE

[Paper by 8.6. Katkov]

[Text] It is shown that when a mixture of a signal and noise
pass through an acoustical-optical frequency gate, a multipli-
cative component appears in the output signal. Expressions to
estimate the precision in measuring the carrier frequency of
radio signals are derived and analyzed.

We shall consider the impact of external additive interference on the precision
of the measurement of the carrier frequency of radio signals passing through a
gating deivce designed around an acoustical-optical (A0) parametric four-pole
network, the generalized schematic of which is depicted in Figure 1. We shall
assume in this case that the receiving and analyzing equipment is optical for
the measurement of the radio signal carrier frequency against a background of
whitenoise.

We shall assume that the input signal s (t) - Re{61(t)}, which is fed to the
first ultrasonic light modulator (UZMSl , takes the form of an additive mixture
of the signal s(t)Re{§(t)} and interference n(t) - Re{n(t)}. while a reference
signal s2(t) - Re(s2(t)} is fed to the input of UZHSZ [ultrasonic light modula-
tor 2].

Let ultrasonic light modulators l and 2 operate in a Raman-Nata diffraction

mode. It is easy to show [1] that in this case. the monochromatic light wave
having a plane front, a frequency of ac; and an amplitude of 20. which is normally
incident to ultrasonic light modulator l, and passes through lenses L1 and L2, as
well as the spatial frequency filter 0 and ultrasonic light modulator 2, will
produce a light distribution in the focal plane of integrating lens L3 which can
be described by the expression:

In the absence of interference, the first and second terms in (2) describe slowly

spectrum instead of the 6-function.

we now consider the expression for the photodetector output current in the
presence of additive interference:

Just as in (2). the first and second terms in (6) describe slowly changing

function of time. The third term in (S) (we shall designate it as i3(t)) describes
the sum of the input signal s(t) and the interference n(t).

Thus, when an additive mixture of a signal and interference is fed to the input
of the parametric four-pole network. the restored electrical signal will contain
additive and multiplicative interference components.

To realize frequency gating of the radio signals. the light field should be
registered by means of photodetectors positioned along the 24 coordinate (Figure l)
and operating in optical heterodyning mode. we shall assume that the photo-
detectors are placed flush against each other and the dimensions of the input
apertures of the photodetectors are the same, while the size of the aperture along
the 24 c-ordinate is many times greater than the current signal spectrum. In this
case. it can be assumed that at each point in time, the light fluz falls only on
one photodetector.

The subsequent processing of the electrical signals from the outputs of the string
of photodetectors is accomplished by means of a multichannel processor, the
functional schematic of which is shown in Figure 2. The device consists of the
photodetectors 1, high frequency-amplifiers 2. detectors 3, threshold gates 4,
resolver 5 and switcher 6. The decision that a signal is present is made in the
case where the signal from the amplifier exceeds the threshold. The functions of
the resolver include making a decision concerning the presence of a signal at the
output of the corresponding channel of the threshold gate. The signals are fed
from the outputs of the high frequency amplifiers to the receiving and analyzing

equipment.

We shall assume that the internal noise of the photodetactors and amplifiers is
a great deal less than the additive and multiplicative interference components,
something which makes it possible to disregard this noise.

Let the input signals and the normal steady-state interference with a zero mean
value be described by expressions of the form:

of the signal and the interference; ﬁ(t) is the complex amplitude of the inter-
ference.

spectral width of the signal, we represent 113(t) in the form:

in the power of the multiplicative interference component.

[interference ratio, the extent of the difference in the carrier frequency

plicative interference increases. This is explained by the predominance of the
influence (for large values of u) of multiplicative interference on o: as compared

COMPLEX SIGNAL RECEPTION AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF "BITE NOISE AND SPECTRALLY
CONCENTRATED INTERFERENCE USING PARALLEL CHANNELS

[Paper by A.Ye. Ulanov]

[Text] The problem of the analysis and synthesis of a
multichannel receiver for complex signals in the presence

of normal fluctuating noise and spectrally concentrated
interference is analyzed. It is shown that if the con-
centrated interference is nongaussian, the introduction of
optimal nonlinear processing in the channels impacted by the
interference leads to an increase in the reception noise
immunity as a whole.

Protecting a complex signal receiver against a strong spectrally concentrated
interference (SP) remains one of the important problems in the design of broad-
band cqnnunications systems.

An effective method of combatting spectrally concentrated interference is
reception via parallel frequency channels. the basis for which is the principle
of "whitening" the interference spectrum, proposed for the first time in [l].

The maximum signal/interference ratio which can he achieved at the output of an
optimal linear combining system, as is well known [2], is equal to the sum of the
signal/interference ratios in the individual frequency channels.

Actual spectrally concentrated interference has distributions of the instantaneous
values which, as a rule. differ from a normal distribution. Included among them
are signals from broadcasting and radio navigation stations, as well as various
kinds of passive and active jamming.

It is also well known [3] that if the interference is nongaussian. the signal]
linterference ratio in the channel can be increased by means of inertialess non-
linear conversion of the input mixture.

Because of what has been presented above, the study of the question of boosting
the noise immunity of the reception of complex signals via parallel channels by
virtue of optimizing the nonlinear processing in each of them is an urgent issue.

The process at the input to the complex signal receiver consists of the sum:

‘ (1)
N) = S(0+t(r)+ 2mm.

l-l

S(t) is a determinate. square integrable function, which determines the structure
of the signal being transmitted; £(t) is additive gaussian white noise; n1(t) is
a function which defines the i-th spectrally concentrated interference and Z is
the number of the concentrated interference.

Reception is accomplished using L >> 1 frequency channels with mutually adjacent
and equal bandwidths, while each channel takes the form of the following series
circuit: filter-nonlinear element-filter. It is assumed that the input and
output bandpass filters have the same square-wave amplitude—frequency response.

The input process (1) is broken down by means of the input bandpass filters into
individual independent frequency samples. As a result, the process at the input
to the inertialless nonlinear element (BN2) of each c: the channels consists of
the sum of the frequency sample of the signal and the narrow band interference,
which in the absence of spectrally concentrated interference in the channel is a
frequency sample of just the gaussian white noise, and when it is present, takes
the form of a certain nongaussian random process: an additive mixture of white
noise and spectrally concentrated interference. Thus, the process at the input
to an individual partial channel can be represented by the sum:

*3 (0 =' a.(1)003[0..l- 'Puu (I)! + R: (0 C05 [”9“ " ‘7” (1)) (2)

ak(t) and s,k(t) are the envelope and phase of the frequency sample of the signal;
Rk;t) and opk(t) arg_the envelope and phase of the resulting interference of the
kuth channel (k - 1,L); “3k is the carrier frequency of the signal, which coin-
cides with the center frequency of the input filter for the k—th channel, while
”pk is the carrier frequency of the resulting interference, which in the general
case does not match ugh.

we shall further hypothesize that the envelope of the interference in each
channel has a Nakagami distribution [6]:

The Nakagani distribution is convenient in that when m - 1, it changes to a
Rayleigh distribution (gaussian interference), and when m > 1. is a good

approximation of a Rice distribution, i.e.. the distribution of the envelope of
the sum of the gaussian narrow band process and the quasihamonic oscillation with
a constant amplitude and arbitrary phase. which is called the nonguassian inter-
forence component in the following. Distribution (1) makes it possible to analyze
all of the characteristic statistical situations which arise in the individual
frequency channels. from the case of interference with a probability density

having maximum entropy (gaussian noise), to the case of interference with minimal
entrow (harmonic interference where m - Is).

Using the criterion of the signal/interference ratio, we shall treat the analysis
and Sngthesis of one network section given the assumption that the desired non-

linear characteristic cf the inertialless nonlinear element is approximated by
the binomial:

' [(X) - cl (X + Cg"). (1')
where :1 and c3 are certain coefficients.

The charactertstic (1-) is convenient in that on one hand, it is easily realized
and is "minimally nonlinear" in the sense of generating the amber of combina-
tion harmonics. and on the other hand, in accordance with [3,5]. is a good approx-
inmt ion of the optimal nonlinear functions obtained when solving the general
proﬁle-n of structural synthesis for nongaussian interference, which is neat fre-
quen:ly encountered in radio engineering practice.

By substituting (2) in (lo), we will find the process which is concentrated in
the first spectral band:

sion of the nongaussian interference component.

In case the signal is masked by the nongaussian interference component and with
a large signal/noise ratio at the input (nu >> 1), Auix . l/o. This actually
means that the cross-modulation product of the signs and interference, observed
at a frequency of (2 - uh), the power of which is equal to the signal power,
makes the major contr ution to the output interference.

when the signal is much less than the gausaian component of the interference

(ms << 1), the gain is “max - m. Consequently, along with the suppression of the
nongaussian interference component, a decrease in the signal/noise ratio by a
factor of two is also observed.

Formula (10) characterizes the gain with the assumption that the output filter
passes all of the output process components without distortion.

However, if the carrier frequency of the spectrally concentrated interference,
-, does not coincide with the center frequency of the filter, on (frequency
m snatched interference), the "generalized system gain" of [6] will be even
greater by virtue of the suppression of the spectral components of the
"combination" noise which falls outside the "transmittance passband" of the
output filter.

In the general case, the c2 inertialless nonlinear element parameters depends
not only on the power parameter of the interference 9, but on its distribution

parameter m. However, this has an impact on the conversion result only for
small values of m.

ratio in a channel in the case of

by a factor of A. because of the
suppression of the nongaussian component of the concentrated interference, which
exceeds the level of the signal and fluctuating noise. Since this result can be
no further improved by means of any kind of conversion, subsequent processing
reduces to the optimal linear combining of the outputs of all of the channels
with weights of (2]: Clk - Sp out/Q k. where 5k out is the signal component. ka

A block diagram of the adaptive multichannel nonlinear filter is depicted in
Figure 1. It contains L channels, in each of which there are input P1 and
output F2 bandpass filters, controlled by the inertialless nonlinear element and
a variable gain amplifier. The analyser of the channel (AK-l) identifies the
channels impacted by the spectrally concentrated interference. In the channels
where is no interference, the nonlinear circuit of the inertialless element is
disconnected (linear mode). In the remaining channels. the parameters of the
inertialless nonlinear element are adjusted in accordance with the adopted
algorithm (the nonlinear mode). The channel analyzer (AX-2) performs the analysis
of the voltage readouta at the outputs of the bandpass filters and establishes
the weights with which the voltages are entered into the common sun.

He shall give the calculation of the reception noise ﬂmnunity using parallel
channels, taking into account the subsequent processing of the complex signal

in a matched filter (8?) in two extreme cases: a) The concentrated interference
is an independent sine wave which is not amplitude modulated; b) All of the
interference takes the form of gauasian oscillations with rapidly changing
amplitudes, and have identical dispersions while their total power is constant.

It is assumed that the signal and the signal and the noise have uniform spectral
densities in the passhand occupied by the complex signal.

We shall introduce the coefficient Au, which characterizes the degree of supo
pression of the "combination" noise as a function of the degree of tuning mismatch
between the carrier frequency of the concentrated interference and the center
frequency of the filter: Auk - [kph - «Okl. In the absence of interference and
in the case of its maximum frequency difference, 1k - 0, since Auk I Ink - uk+1l.
Then the maximum signal/interference ratio at the output of the optimum combining
system is equal to:

 

L
C - -\‘ 2A- C ‘
“'12.; 35: ;—.. ("it ‘1”

It is not difficult to show that in case (a), the ratio Q2“: at the output of the
matched filter. in accordance with (13), is equal to:

I l l
2;; =(*-r+r2-’:+z.)”za'

q§n is the signal/noise ratio at the receiver input; 3 is the complex signal
base [7].

As is well known [7]. the maximum signal/interference ratio is achieved in the
case of ideal coherent compensation for the interference and is equal to:

o _ 2
Qaax 23411“.

The curves for the ratio qguc/ 2 are plotted in Figure 2 as a function of the
number of impacted channels Z/L or three values of Au - 0, 0.5 and l (u I 1:15
are the solid lines. The maximum disadvantage of adaptive nonlinear filtering

as compared to ideal compensation amounts to 3 dB in all when Z/L - l and A” - 1.
When Au - 0, an adaptive nonlinear filter is not inferior to an ideal interference

compensator.

Curves borrowed from [8) are shown in Figure 2 with the dashed lines for compar-
ison with other well known reception methods. Straight line 1 corresponds to
reception directly with the matched filter. Function 2 characterizes the noise
immunity of a quasi-optimal amplitude equalizer with rejection of the spectrally
concentrated interference, while curve 3 is for an adaptive linear filter. It
can be seen from the graph that the gain in the reception noise immunity for the
case of optimal nonlinear processing in the channels has a more substantial
effect at greater values of l/L. i.e.. in the case of greater saturation of the
radio channel with concentrated interference, something which is quite important.

In case (b) and with optimal processing, the signal/interference ratio at the
matched filter output coincides with the signal/interference ratio at the output
of the linear adaptive filter, since c9a - 0, k - l L (curve 3).

It should be noted in conclusion that in a real interference situation, which is
characterized by the presence of concentrated interference with different statis-
tical properties, one can substantially boost the reception noise humunity using
parallel channels by virtue of optimizing the nonlinear processing in each of

the channels. One of the design solutions can be the algorithm for adaptive
nonlinear filtering found in this paper. which makes it possible in a number of

cases to obtain a result close to ideal compensation for spectrally concentrated
interference.

[Paper by V.P. Garmash]

[Text] Functional electronics devices are widely used in modern radioelectronics
[1]. Such devices include magnetostrive transducers. for which any parameter
which governs the conversion efficiency is nade variable along the direction of
nave propagation [2].

The mechanism for generating the pulse characteristic of a pair of magnetostric-
tive transducers is shown in Figure l.

A waveguide made of a material which posseses the magnetoetrictive effect and is
magnetically biased by virtue of an internal or external magnetization, is
depicted in Figure la.

The input and output transducers are made in the form of single turns 1 and 2.
Hhen a current pulse (delta-pulse) is fed to transducer 1, a mechanical stress
wave o0 appears by virtue of the nagnetostriction effect. which in passing by
transducer 2 excites a voltage pulse e in the latter. If the conversion effect
is the same at all points in the waveguide, then assuming the position of the
transducers to be variable, we obtain: e' . e(t - x/v - y/v - L/v), where v is
the wave velocity.

If the transducer is made in the form of a coil with a variable pitch, then the
e.m.f. enclosed between planes spaded dy distance apart on a portion of a turn
will be: de - Hye'(t - x/v - y/v)dy. where H, is the tangent of the slope angle
of the turn (or what is the same thing. the winding density). The sign of ﬂy is
determined by the direction of rotation of the coil. The e.m.f. from one turn
of the input transducer is equal to:

In

In an analogous manner, when using a complex winding at the input transducer,
the expression for the total e.m.f., is:

'I in
e — { “my, (I — x/v— 11/0)de (1)
‘I 'I

The functions "x and "Y are by definition real quantities. By equating expression

(1) to the requisite pulse characteristic E(t),w obtain the equation for the
determination of "x and ﬂy.

Thus. the functions UK and Hy realize the linear conversion of the signals e(t).
Assuming that "y is specified, we obtain the simpler function:

The pulserresponse has been recorded for transducers made in the form of single
turns and placed on a waveguide made of 015 an [decimal point not given in

original] wire. Siasing of the transducers was used to make the form of s(t)
independent of x and y.

The calculated and experimental pulse characteristics of a pair of magneto-
strictive transducers with a specified distribution of terms ("y and "3) are
shown in Figure 2. The good agreement makes it possible to conclude that there
is high precision in the correspondence of the physical and mathematical models
of magnetostrictive transducers with "long" coils.

A STUDY OF THE METALLIZATION 0F MOS STRUCTURES BY MEANS OF SECONDARY ION MASS

[Abstract of paper by Didenko, P.I., Msrchenko, R.I. and Romanova, G.F.]

[Text] The results of a study of the physical and chemical state of the Al-SiOz-Si
system using secondary ion mass spectrometry are generalized. It is shown that

the nature of the energy distribution of secondary ions for the major components of
the mass spectrum depends substantially on the planar inhomogeneity of the separa-
tion boundary between the metal and the dielectric. The degree of change in the
structure of the dielectric film depends on the method of applying the metal
electrode. something which is reflected in a change in the degree of hydration and
the electrical strength of the SiOz layer. A structural model of the Al-Sioz-Si
system is discussed. Figures 5; references 9.

[Abstract of paper by Kaganovich, E.B., Maksimenko, Yu.N. and Svechnikov, S.V.]

[Text] The resistance and reactances of an equivalent series circuit for two
types of light sensitive sandwich structures are studied as a function of fre—
quency. bias voltage and illumination. The first type of structure is fabricated
using CdSe films deposited in a vacuum; the second is based on CdS powders with
binders precipitated in a centrifuge.

It is shown that the real component of the impedance decreases with a rise in the
frequency (200 to 2 - 105 Hz) from the value of the direct current resistance to
a value close to the contact resistance. The existence of regions of working

parameters is established (frequency. bias voltage, illumination), in which the
equivalent resistance in light exceeds its dark value. A sharp rise in the equiva-
lent capacitance is observed as compared to the geometric values in step with
increasing illumination and bias voltage at low frequencies. The conclusion is
drawn that the equivalent circuits are different for the two types of structures.

[Text] The characteristics (sign. density, localization) of a charge incorporated
in a dielectric means of radiation. as well as the parameters (density, energy
distribution) of the surface states of a Si-Sioz separation boundary created in
HOS structures by gamma and ultraviolet (UV) radiation are studied by means of the
volt-faraday and the volt-ampere functions of the photoemission and contact
potential difference. The analysis of the results obtained and their comparison
for the cases of various kinds of radiation and irradiation conditions makes it
possible to draw definite conclusions concerning the specific features of the

[Abstract of paper by Komashchenko, V.N. and Nedostup, V.N.]

[Text] The properties of positionally sensitive biphotocells (PChF) with a trans-
verse photoelectric effect are described, where these are fabricated based on
thin film polycrystalline chalcogenide type heterostructures of cadmium (zinc)
copper-chalcogenide. It is shown that the positionally sensitive photocells which
were studied are characterized by a large dynamic range of the travel character-
istic and high values of the slope of its linear portion. high resolving and
detecting powers, as well as an operational speed, low temperature and timewise
drift which are independent of the illumination of the light probe. Their fabri-
cation technology ia rather simple and economical. It allows for the fabrication
of positionally sensitive photocells with a preset region and shape for the
spectral sensitivity, as well as photosensitive elements of various shapes and
sizes. Figures 2; tables 1; references 12.

SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE RECOMBINATION PROPERTIES OF LARGE DIAMETER SILICON

[Text] A comparative study is made of the recombinationsl properties of large
and small diameter silicon bars obtained by Czochralskiy's technique which contain
oxygen in a concentration of about 1018 cm-3.

it is shown that recombination in large diameters bars is controlled by oxygen
complexes which lead to a substantial difference in the lifetimes of electrons and

[Text] The spectral characteristics of the photoconductivity of Cdo.zﬁgo.gTe
crystals are studied where various surface treatments are used for the purpose

of ascertaining the possibility of controlling their photosensitivity in a region
of from 2 to 14 micrometers. The treatments utilized have a substantial impact

on the signal amplitude and the form of the photoconductivity spectrum, where a
correlation 13 observed between a decrease in the signal at the maximum photosensi-

tivity and an increase in the photoeonductivity in the short wave region. It is
shown that the minimum surface recombination rate of S - 350 cm/see is observed
in crystals with electrically polished surfaces; all other treatments lead to

a value of S and order of magnitude or more greater than this level. It is
presupposed that the bulk lifetime in the surface layers of the crystals being
studied is not constant and depends on the surface treatments to qualitatively
explain the effects observed. Figures 1; tables 2; references 14.

[Annotation and table of contents of book "Optical Communications Cables: Theory
and Design", by Nikolay Aleksandrovich Semenov, Izdatel'stvo "Radio 1 svyaz'",
5000 copies, 153 pages]

[Text] Optical cable (0K) is considered a constituent of an optical data trans-
mission system which determines its fundamental properties. Physical principles
of transmission of wideband signals along OKs containing lightguides (8V) of
various types operating under multiple mode and single mode conditions are dis-
cussed; in some cases the concept of partial waves and beam interpretation in

SV is utilized. Concepts are introduced about variable and emerging waves. A
brief examination is given to typical structural circuits of communications sys-
tems using optical cable and technology for producing optical fibers.

A systematic theory of regular lightguides is evolved; modifications are derived
for dispersion equations, theoretical formulas for phase and group velocities,
group delay time. attenuation coefficient, power flux distribution. The cor-
responding program for a computer is described and results of calculation are
cited. The question of optimization of the profile of the refractive index of

a gradient lightguide is considered. The effect of lightguide irregularities in
optical cables is discussed: flexurea, microscopic bends, lightguide intercon-
nections, interfaces with sources and receivers. Transitional attenuations be-
tween lightguides in optical cables are determined. Analysis of the passage of
signals thrOugh optical cable based on chromatic and modal dispersions made it
possible to determine bandpass under various operating conditions. Basic principles
of optical cable design are formulated and examples of calculations of deformations
in optical cable components are given.

For scientific workers specializing in development of optical cable technology,
communication systems and control systems.

[Text] Annotation

This book presents the basics of planning automatic intercity telephone exchanges
using type ANTS-3, ANTS-4, ARM-20, ANTS K2 equipment and automatic switching
unit.

The book is intended for engineering and technical workers involved in planning
and operating automatic intercity telephone exchanges.

Foreword

The creation of a nationwide automatically switched telephone network involves
the construction of automatic intercity telephone exchanges (Alf!) and automatic
switching units (ASU). In the process of being developed. modern technical
automatic switching facilities are reaching higher quality levels; telephone
exchanges with new capabilities and new switching and control principles are

being created.

The present book is the first attempt at a systematic exposition of the basics

of planning AITB and A50 of various types considering their interaction in a

network. As new equipsent is developed and assimilated, it will become possible

to introduce appropriate modifications and improvements to planning methodology.

[Annotation, foreword and table of contents from book "Theory and Techniques of Ra-
dar Data Processing Against the Background of Interference", by Yskov Davidovich 51.1,-

man andVVladimir Nikolayevich Manshos, "Radio 1 svyaz'", 10,000 copies, #16 pages]

[Text] The authors generalized the problems of the optimization of multichannel
and single-channel detection, measurement and resolution of radar signals.

Main attention is given to the principles of synthesis and problems of technical re-
alization of various analog and digital detectors and meters of signal parameters
against the background of correlated nonsteady-state interferences, problems of the
adaptation to the conditions of a priori ambiguity, etc. A large number of illus-
trative examples are given.

The book is intended for specialists engaged in the theory, design and operation of
radioelectronic facilities and systems.

Foreword

The rapid development of radioelectronics, and the theory and techniques of proces-
sing radar information in particular, makes it difficult to generalize various pub-
lications in this area. However, there is an urgent need in generalizing publica-
tions covering the present state of the theory and the prospects for the realization
of its conclusions.

Therefore, the generalization of the "established" and new problems of processing
radar information against the background of interferences from a single sufficient-
1y general, methodological position is an urgent but difficult problem. For example,
the improvement of the element base broadened the possibilities of multichannel re-
ception. Signals and interference are described by sets of time functions, or by
functions of time and coordinates. Space-time processing of signals against the
background of interference ensuring its effective suppression (not only in radar)
becomes the subject of optimization. Generalization of new problems of such proces-
sing is a substantial part of the goal stated above.

This book is an attempt to solve this problem to some degree. It is based on courses
of lectures on the radar theory: for engineers improving their skills; for graduate
students and candidates preparing for postgraduate examinations. Special attention
is given to problems which are not always clearly and fully explained in published
sources: theory of primary space-time processing of radar information against the
background of correlated interferences with provision not only for the accumulation
of useful signals but also for compensating interfering signals; theory of measur-
ing of signal parameters changing and not changing in time against the background of
interference in the process of primary and secondary processing; adaptation theory;
adaptive antennas and moving target selection systems; new methods of coherent pro-
cessing of simple and complex space-time signals -- digital, optical, and spin me-
thods.

Much attention is given to the compactness, uniformity and simplicity of presenta-
tion of relatively complex theoretical material. The book reflects many years of
teaching experience and personal investigations of the authors in this area. Many
examples are given. The book will be useful not only to engineers and graduate stu-
dents, but also to undergraduate students of vuses. Materials which until now could
be used by a narrow circle of researchers have now become accessible to many others.

The authors express their gratitude to V. Ye. Dulevich, D. I. Lekhovitskiy and M. B.
Sverdlik for their useful comments.

[Text] 6.8. Cryoelectronic Receiving Modules Using Hybrid IR CCD’a.

As was shown in 56.6, cryoelectronic modules have been used to an ever greater
extent in recent years for remote sensing in the IR band in various fields of
science and engineering. This has been greatly stimulated by the development of
thermal inagers in medicine for the determination of the heat picture of the human
body for the purpose of early diagnosis of numerous illnesses at small distances
from the object to the receiver, as well as the development of scanners for the
study of the earth's natural resources in meteorological, geological and other
research at great distances from the radiation source [17]. All of this work would
be impossible without the synthesis of new narrow band semiconductor materials,
the width of the forbidden band in which corresponds to the low energy of the quan-
ta in the various regions of the IR hand, without the creation of new methods of
fabricating diode structures which have a high detection capability, without the
development of low noise. small signal amplification techniques and without the
successes of cryogenic engineering and methods of seaming within a specific field
of view. Despite the design of various types of charge coupled devices during
1970 ~ 1976 [33, 36, 51c], mechanical scanning receivers with a single cryoelec-
tronic IR receiver and an autonomous cryogenic installation for continuously main-
taining the requisite cooling level have become the most widespread in IR receiv-
ing systems operating at long ranges. If moving images are received, the scanning
is accomplished in one plane using the well-known configuration adopted for ther-
mal imagers (Figure 6.13).

The received signal of one "point" of an image in the IR band passes through the
scanning mirror (1) (or rotating prism) to the input of the optical IR mirror
system (2) and is focused on the sensitive area of the IR receiving element (3),
which is coupled to the low noise preamplifier (4) located in cryostat (5). Unit
(6) is coupled to a photographic recorder which has a light source, the beam of

which travels over photographic film synchronously with the motion of mirror (1),
recording the intensity of each point of the IR image in a horizontal line.

Figure 6.13. Electromechanical cryoelectronic scanning receiver
for the infrared band.

Key: A. Input IR signal.

Multiple element IR receivers which operate in various portions of the IR spectrum
are used to improve the resolution of such systems and provide for pattern recogni-
tion. The type 8-192 multichannel cryoelectronic scanning receiver, installed in
the "Skylab" (0.8.), with 12 channels in the visible, near and middle In regions
(to 2.5 um) and with a 13th channel for 10.8 - 12.5 um [12] has extremely good
parameters. This device is made using a single Cdxﬂgl-xTe semiconductor material
and is cooled to a temperature of 90 °K.

The fundamental drawback to all mechanical IR scanning receivers is the peripheral
distortion of the diameter of the circle of confusion which falls on the receiving
element, with a deviation from the main optical axis of just a slight viewing angle,
as well as the impossibility of controlling the scan in a wide range, the necessity
of having special electronic circuitry for the utilization of multiple element re-
ceivers and mechanical devices with an electric motor. The use of electronic scan-
ning with CCD's makes it possible to eliminate the deficiencies enumerated above
and enjoy the new functional capabilities in them. For this reason, the develop-
ment and study of CCD's and IR band receivers using CCD's have become a promising
field in recent years in which numerous researchers are at work [33-36). One of
the major problems confronting designers consists in retaining the same ultimate
sensitivity in an electronically scanned system as in a single receiver with a sta-
tionary reflector and making use of the advantages which deep cooling yields so as
to improve the noise and amplification properties of CCD's.

The scanning task is facilitated in thermal imaging receivers in that the images
received only by one line of IR receiving elements, the number of which for a
specified resolution (size of the sensitive receiving area) determines the aspect
angle when viewing the terrain. For this reason, it is expedient to construct the
receiver in two ways: the element by element connection of each of the receivers
of the infrared strip, which is fabricated from a narrow band material, to the
input cells of a silicon CCD shift register, which performs the function of
series-parallel conversion and information compaction; or by setting up a matrix
of IR linear strips, each of which is connected element by element to a CCD regis-

When both of these methods are used. it is necessary to insert a differential
amplifier at the output of the CCD register. where an additional CCD register is
simultaneously connected to the amplifier to suppress the clock noise. A schematic

An entire series of complex problems which derive from the following main require-
ments must be solved in the design of hybrid CCD's which operate in various por-
tions of the infrared band: the values of the spectral volt-watt sensitivity of
infrared CCD's should approximately correspond to these values for individual IR
receiving elements; the internal noise level and the value of the detection capa-
hility D* of an IR hand hybrid CCD should be of the same order of magnitude as in
individual IR elements, and in this case, the clock noise must be suppressed to a
level at which it does not degrade the signal/noise ratio at the output of the
linear channel with the CCD's; the speed and passband of the device should on the
whole assure its operation in image receivers; the size of the sensitive receiving
area of the IR elements and the step in the chip of the linear strip of IR re-
ceivers shOuld govern the size of the step in the CCD shift register; the amount
of heat due to heat influx via the connecting conductors, which exit the cryostat
housing of the hybrid IR CCD. and the amount of heat liberated by the elements of
the device should not exceed (0'2"°-3)Qt~ where Q; is the total heat influxes in
the cryostat, and the uniformity of the parameters should be high. To resolve
these problems. it is first of all necessary to develop techniques for the design
of the input and output circuits in hybrid CCD's. We shall consider a few input
circuits which are necessary for matching the output of a cooled IR receiving

coupled devices. Hybrid CCD's with direct charge injection. The sinplest input
device is on: consisting of a p-n junction and controlling insulated gates, which
provide for either for the creation of a potential "911 for the storage of the

flow of the injected charge into the first potential well of the CCD register.

(PbSnTc) has Rn (V - 0), A = 0.7 ohms - cm2 and CA (50 av) I 45 de. As can be
seen from the figure, at low frequencies the conductance of the input junction
exerts the main influence on the value of n;. and at relatively high frequencies
(more than 100 to 150 KHz). the capacitance of the input junction begins to have
an impact.

The coefficient at depends on a number of factors: on the ratio of the voltages
at the gates and the p-n junction, on the degree of overlap of the p-n junction
by the input gate and the ratio of their capacitances as well as on the mutual
positioning of the input gate electrodes and the first electrode of the CCD. In
turn, depending on the operational mode of the CCD, the circuit configuration of
the input gate or that for the formation of the MOS capacitor, or for the forma-
tion of the conducting channel connecting the p-n junction to the first potential
well in the cell. the virtual drain of the MOS transistor, can have an influence
on the coefficient ng. When a suppleaental floating low capacitance diffusion
region is used in the input device to reduce the level of input noise. the injec-
tion coefficient at can be slightly reduced.

Stickle et a1. [35] analyzed the signal/noise ratio for infrared band hybrid
CCD's with direct charge injection, which utilize a summing with delay operation.
For a hybrid IR system with a matrix of nine photodiodes based on (HngTe) at

(A = 12 um) under standard conditions (Tb - 300 °K, a field of view angle of 90'),
a signal/noise ratio on the order of 500 was obtained for a photon flux of

3 . 1017, the dynamic range was 300 and the increase in the useful signal because
of the noise was equivalent to a temperature range of 0.1 “K.

If only the low frequency range is considered and the influence of modulation is
neglected, then the equivalent circuit of a hybrid CCD for the case of direct
injection vill contain the parallel connected conductance and capacitance of the
photodiode and the overall conductance and capacitance of the CCD input. The
light sensitivity of the photodiode in the idealized case is determined from the
expression:

I.—l.’(exp qVIkT—l) +1.. (6 .61)
where I8 is the inverse diode saturation current, I. is the photogeneration
current, where I. - anbA and 05 is the photon flux.

As is well known, the quantity 1; depends on the resistance of the photodiode
no as follows for the case of zero bias:

Ia - kT/qko (6.42)

The signal current distribution for a bias voltage across the diode VV- 0, will
correspond to the expression:

Icu) ' lm=I./(_|+‘;'R;'). . (6.43)

since the overall current is

. 1,=I.(|IR.+(.). W“)

The slope of the CCD input in the saall signal case is expressed by the ratio for
the conductance gm:

where Z/L is the ratio of the geometric dimensions of the input gate, u is the
minority carrier nobility, Coxc is the capacitance of the oxide per unit area.

The signal injection efficiency is expressed by the ratio ICCD/IO and it is
therefore desirable that this quantity be as close as possible to unity. This
means that the entire current generated by the photon flux in the photodiode
goes to the CCD register. It follows from expression (6.43) that the product
ng0 should be large for large values of the injection efficiency, although the
dependence of g. on ICCDv as can be seen from (6.53), complicates the picture.

We shall analyze the so-called subthreshold mode. which is defined by the

relationship:
' 2 C If '
,’mc<<""'£“'2 _ (T) - (6.1.6)

For a typical input circuit of a silicon CCD, having
Z/L - 4. u = 700 cm2 - V'1 - sec‘l, CA - 3 ' 10"8 P/cm2 and T - 300 °K,
The ultimate current is approximately 30 nA.

If the function

'+ 7%,???

is represented as a function of the small parameter ’I;; and is expanded in a
Taylor's series. by limiting ourselves to the zero and first term of f(x) -

- l + (l/2)x + ..., then in the chosen node, the expression for g. in formula
(6.45) reduces to:

gm - qICCD/k'i‘ (6.1.7)
-g.=quJIzT.

Then expression (6.44) will assume the form ICCD - I. + kT/qRo. It follows from
this that the condition I. >> I; provides for lﬁO percent signal charge injection.
For photovoltaic receiving IR elements, this likewise means a condition of limita-
tion on the sensitivity by the external background (BLIP). The background limita-
tion condition. as was demonstrated earlier, is extremely important. since this
means 100 percent signal charge injection, high linearity of the light response
between ICCD and 9b as well as good uniformity of the channel, which does not
depend on the value of R0. The total noise voltage of the photodiode is:

follows:

where the first term is the Johnson noise of the strongly inverted channel region
and the second is 1/f type noise.

The value of the specific detection capability 0* for a hybrid IR band CCD can
be defined as:

In the experiments of Sato Iwasa and Vita with a single chdTe photodiode in a
range of wavelengths close to S um. as well as those of Stickle, Alfeyev,

Bovina, Krev, Legezo. Stafeyev, Shamansyev. Nelson, et a1. with nultielenent
HngTe photodiodes in strips in a range of wavelengths of 8 to 12 us, the possi-
bility of introducing electrical charges from photovoltaic receiving elements
based on narrow band solid ternary solutions, into a silicon CCD shift register
was demonstrated for the first time, where these elements were connected in the
circuit of a for infrared band hybrid CCD [36, 37]. With the optinun selection
of the technology for a wavelength of A a 5|s:[36], such a photovoltaic cell has
a high impedance, since its equivalent circuit (at A - 5 un) consists of a resist-
ance of g 106 ohms and a capacitance on the order of a few picofarads, connected
in parallel. and dissipates a low power: < 1 microwatt.

A direct injection experiment at a wavelength of S um was performed with a single
photodiode based on p-n junction, fabricated on a p-type substrate by means of
directly connecting the p-region of the photodiode to the p-region of a CCD with
a surface channel. and the n-region of the photodiode to the n-region of the
diffusion source of the CCD. The parameters of this photodiode are given in
Table 6.2.

A two—phase supply for the carry electrodes was used in the CCD registers us
well as an input read gate made of A1. which was connected to phase 01 of the
clock supply at a frequency of 500 KHz. A bias voltage of approxinately -1 V was

fed to the electrodes made of polysilicon in order to provide for an input current
of 0.2 uA for the purpose of compensating the photoelectric current of the photo-
voltaic receiving cell generated by the background and thereby providing for the
operation of this element at zero bias.

Black body radiation at T - 500 °K was modulated by a mechanical modulator

ata frequency of 723 Hz. The modulated signal was processed by selective and
broadband amplifiers, and was measured by means of spectrum analyzer in a pass-
band of 10 Hz. The spectral noise density at the CCD output amounted to 6 uv/Hzll2
at 723 3:. In the experiment of [36], the HngTe photovoltaic cell operated at a
typical signal/noise ratio value of 600. In the case of the direct connection of
the photodiode to the CCD input, the signal/noise ratio at the CCD output proved
to be 600+100. These values correspond to the value of the detection capability

signal and noise are generated only by the chdTe photodiode and the output of
the hybrid circuit with the CCD, something which is clearly demonstrated by the
oscilloscope traces in [36]. The noise factor of the given hybrid circuit,
computed from formula (6.39), amounted to F - 1.0 for the following d ta, which
were obtained experimettally: R0 - 20 Hohm, Io - 0.2 uA, T - 77 °K, eglf - 18/f

hybrid circuit configuration, can be no worse than the value of D* of a single
photodiode. In this case, each photodiode cell based on HngTe can dissipate a
power on the order of IZRO - 0.8 u". something which is an insignificant amount
as compared to the power dissipated by photoresistive type receiving IR elements.

A circuit is given in paper [37] for an experimental unit to study the reception
of the emission of a 002 laser by a far IR band hybrid CCD using light receiving
cells made of Hgoogcdo.2Te. In this unit, the laser radiation passes through a
mechanical modulator to a photodiode string made of HngTe cells, each of which is
connected either directly or through a multichannel amplifier to the p-n junctions
of the input cells of the multiple input silicon CCD shift registers with three
phase supply and molybdenum transport electrodes. The hybrid CCD is placed in a
cryostat with liquid nitrogen, having an input window made of clear coated Ge. The
CCD electrodes and the output stage designed around MOS transistors are driven

from a clock pulse generator at a working frequency of 250 KHz, located outside
the cryostat.

interference and through a matching device to a dual trace oscilloscope. The sig—
nal from the CCD is fed to the input for one trace while the signal from an addi-
tional photodiode is fed to the other, where this diode registers the modulated
radiation directly from the 602 laser. An attenuator which attenuates the laser
power down to the requisite values in placed between the laser and the mechanical
modulator operating at a frequency of 60 Hz.

The silicon CCD is made in the form of lé-input HOS type structure with a step of
100 um having a common control gate for all the inputs and diffusion p-n junctions
which are not overlapped by the control gate, for the injection of charge carriers
from the photodiodes into the potential wells under every third transport electrode.
When a photoresistive linear strip for the IR band is used, special matching cir-
cuitry is employed. The charge transfer loss factor in a CCD shift register cooled
down to T = 77°K was reduced by a factor of 10 as compared to the value at T -

= 300 °K. The signals from the receiving elements can also be fed to the gates.

The dimensions of the IR radiation sensitive areas are 100 r 100 um. The p-n junc-
tions were produced by mercury diffusion and the ohmic contacts were made using
indium. The doping depth of the p-n junction was 15 to 20 um and the photoresistor
thickness was 20 to 30 um. The volt-watt sensitivity was higher than 103 VI“. The
photoreceiving elements are arranged on a substrate of leuco-sapphire. Measure-
ments of the characteristics which were made ahead of the input of the CCD and
following the CCD demonstrated the total identity of the modulated signals and the
small signal losses when the signal received from the C02 laser passes through the
hybrid IR band CCD.

No nonlinearity was detected in the output signal when the laser signal power was
varied by more than 40 dB. The output signal level with an increase in the temp-
erature of the silicon CCD register up to T - 300 °K and the IR element temperature

kept at T = 77 °K was reduced by a factor of two to three. Similar results were
also obtained when PbSnTe elements were used.

:, 21nd 009' 3 based on phot oconductive films. Any photoconductive film
which can be successfully deposited on silicon dioxide without creating fast
states (or traps) at the separation boundary between the silicon and the silicon
dioxide can be used in devices of this kind. The role of the photoconductive
Film consists in acting directly on the inversion channel of the input HOS transis-
tor which is connected to the CCD element. The degree of inversion in turn deter-
nines the rate of charge transport in the CCD. The number of input HOS transistors
which can be fabricated on a single chip with a CCD shift register corresponds to
the number of photoconductive film receiving elements. The advantage of this de-
vice consists in the fact that the photoconductive film can be precipitated in
various ways following the formation of the MOS charge coupled device on the oxide
or on the $1 to create hetero-CCD's.

The operation of this device is described by the following sequence of operations
for the case of a photoresistor at the gate:

--A voltage is fed to the film bias electrode. It should be sufficiently high to
produce the inversion of semiconductor conductivity at the oxide--semiconductor
separation boundary underneath the photosensitive elements;

--Voltage is supplied to the control electrode so as to provide the requisite
level of resistance which is inserted in series with the photoconducting gate;

--The bias voltage at the photoconducting gate is set somewhat higher than the
threshold voltage level for this gate. This leads to maximum charge transport in
the absence of an optical input signal and prevents the blurring of the image;

--Thc incident IR band photons cause a reduction in the resistance of the photo-
conductive films. As a result, the voltage drop across each photoconductive film
proves to be inversely proportional to the local density of incident photons;

--The charge transported in the CCD now becomes a function of the intensity of
the IR illumination of the photoconductive film. The nature of the transient
phenomena in the device in the nonsteady-stat! illumination mode is governed by
how rapidly the capacitance of the photoconductive gate is discharged through
the bias resistor.

A device of this type, in being a hybrid indirect injection device, makes it
possible to design a straightforward and technologically simple linear or matrix
IR image reception system using CCD's. Another structural configuration is also
possible for the hybrid CCD's, in which the photoresistive 18 receiving elements
are made in the form of linear strips of photoresistors on a monocrystrl of a
narrow band material, for exanple, HngTe or PbSnTe, which is secured to a common
passive substrate with a multiple input CCD shift register. In such a device de-
sign, which is used primarily in lines" video receivers, the signal input elements
for the CCD can have an internal gain or be made just as in the case where photo-
conductive films are used, only a group layout is necessary for the contact metal
films from the monocrystal of the IR photoresistors to the CCD chip, without form-
ing individual contact areas which take up considerable space, and possibly, the
connecting of the photoresistors to the input CCD diodes.

Hybrid indirect injection CCD's based on film pyroelectric receivers‘. Pyroelec-
tric materials are used because of the fact that IR radiation can be registered
due to the strong temperature dependence off the polarization (a review of pyro-
electric receivers is given in Patli's paper). However, in the steady-state, the
polarization proves to be masked by the surface charges, and for this reason the
incident radiation must modulated. As a result, the recording is realized using
alternating current, while the background signal level is subtracted. Pyro-
electric receivers are fabricated from inexpensive materials and operate at room
temperature. However, the sensitivity of the existing pyroelectric IR receivers
is considerably lower than for quantum receivers, and for this reason, cooling is
also promising here.

The detection of thermally induced electrical charges in a pyroelectric becomes
possible if the dielectric of the capacitor is a pyroelectric material close to
the Curie-Weiss point, for example, triglycine-sulfate (T68) at room temperature.
A signal can be fed from a pyroelectric receiver to a CCD in two ways: connected
a capacitor to the input MOS transistor on the same chip; create a pyroelectric
film between the MOS transistor channel and the metal of the gate (i.e., insert
it in series with the gate). These methods are essentially the same; the second
one is more technologically complex, but makes it possible to obtain a more com—
pact structure. The operational principle of the device consists in the follow-
ing. The voltage produced by the pyroelectric receiver modulates the depth of
the potential well in the MOS structure; the rate of thermally generated charge
carrier transport to the nearest potential well of the CCD shift register of the
least cross-section, but the deepest, is thereby modulated. The voltage V0 is
constant and chosen so that the depth of the potential well amounts to a few RT.
The charge generation processes (primarily from surface states) keep the well
practically filled with charge carriers. Charge drainage takes place through the
potential barrier to the CCD channel. The voltages for the device so that the
following conditions are met for a variable image signal, modulated by a special
chopper: the amplitude is not limited by the dark current; the dark current
reaches a level such that the signal modulation level amounts to practically 1001.

An analysis of the noise properties of the device of [33] shows that as a first
approximation, thermal noise introduced by the receiver and the input circuit
plays the dominant role. In the typical case of an IR band CCD with receiving
elements made of triglycine sulfate with an area of 10‘5 cm2 on $102 with a thick-
ness of 600 K at 20 frames per second, the minimum temperature difference which
can be resolved by the device can amount to about 0.3‘K in a transnittance window
of 8 to 12 micrometers. It should be noted that for the realization of the
theoreticaly working characteristics in typical devices, it is necessary to provide for
for a high degree of thermal insulation of the receiver so that it is not heated
up by the substrate and there is no crosstalk interference between individual
receiving elements arranged in a row.
