AIRBUS FAMILY m INCLUDE LARGE-CAPACITY, mus-Rance TA 9
Paris AIR a COSMOS in French 9 Jan 82 pp 19-21
[Article by Jacques Morisset: I‘Airbus Industrie's Future TA 9']

[Text] Between 1969 and 1980, the number of transport aircraft builders dropped
from 18 to B, the ratio of the nusber of suppliers to the number of airlines from
a little less than 3 to a little more than 2, and the average number of types of
planes per airline from a little over 4 to 3.4 'source: IATA [International Air
Transport Association]).

The massive reshuffling of the cards that is now taking place in the industry.
accelerated by Lockheed's decision to abandon the TriStar (despite its evident

good points), cannot but speed up the process of concentration. Very shortly, in
the over-loo-passenger transport plane sector there will be but three builders or

groups of builders: Boeing, Airbus lndustrie, and McDonnell Douglas jointly with
Fokker for the development of the nor-100. If the latter project does not actual-
ly become a program--and there are serious doubts that Pokker will be able to ob-
tain the financial backing it needs and that McDonnell Douglas will want to invest
in a new product line--the airlines are likely to find themselves, within a rela-
tively short time, with aging DC-9 and DC-lo families and only two remaining
suppliers: Boeing and Airbus Industrie.

The client, however, except for the state-owned airlines. will never rest easy
with only one supplier available to him. Now, the only builder in a position to
offer a complete line of aircraft, ranging from 100- to SOD-passenger models, is
Boeing. The conclusion is self-evident: To compete effectively against the
Seattle giant, Airbus Industrie must add substantially to its line, which is lim-
ited currently to the 200/300-passenger niche and to the short and medium distan-
ces. Provided it positions itself to fulfill this need and is able to hammer way

at it without interruptions, the European consortium has a bright future ahead of
it.

At the lower end of the scale, as is known Airbus Industrie is beginning to
develop its new A-320 family (see AIR 6 COSMOS no 887). At the upper end, start-
ing with the A-JOO/A-Jlo, a family of planes is in the making to cover higher
seating capacities and longer cruising ranges. But, for obvious development-cost

reasons, Airbus lndustrie must limit its innovational effort to the strict mini-
mum. Boeing, on the other hand, is solidly entrenched in the long-haul transport
niche, the sole remaining planes competing for it being the 3-747 and the
x-lo-JO e

In the "Meecano" game Airbus Industrie is being compelled to play (see AIR e cos-
nos no 886), it is obvious that a capacity increase, in the form of an elongated
version of the A-300/A-300-600, is a less risky undertaking than a plunge into the
long-haul transport sector, although the development of a common airfoil opens

the way to the latter.

Of course, the first question that arises is that of the market; an elongated Air-
bus will offer a capacity identical to that of the DC-lo and the L-lOll. These
two, however, are getting along in age: A goodly part of the Dc-lo-lO/ls fleet is
now 9-10 years old; the LaIOll's are a little younger, their ages pyramiding at a
maximum of 8 years. The B-741's, more spaced out in time, peak at 10-11 years,
but their renewal has already started (some 100 or so 2-year-old planes).

The need to replace the DC-lO-lO's and the L-lOll's, probably in the absence of
direct successors, thus appears certain to begin in the first half of the coming
decade. Meanwhile, however, their fabrication having come to a halt, the need is
already evident for short- and medium-range plane with a 25-percent higher capa-
city than the A-300. This need, Airbus lndustrie feels, will be filled by the
introduction of its new plane during the second half of the present decade: that
is, within the relatively near future.

The survey already conducted among the users provides the following two sets of
requirements:

--The short-haul airlines require a capacity of 350 seats (tourist class) to

‘25 seats (high density), capable of being used over distances of 1,000 nautical
miles (less than 2,000 kilometers) between stops, carrying freight as well.
Recommended length of runway fOr takeoff at sea level, ISA [International Standard
AtmosphereJ-rlSOCL fully loaded: 7,000 feet (2,100 meters); for landing: 6,000
Feet.

--Por the majority of other airlines: 325 seats in mixed arrangement: cruising

range at least 3,000 nautical miles (5,500 kilometers) with full load of passen-
gers (and baggage); maximum length of runway for takeoff: 8,850 feet (2,700 ne-
ters).

These two sets of requirements are perfectly compatible with the same basic plane:
the TA-9; that is, an elongated Airbus (thus offering a high degree of commonal-
ity with the A-310 and the A-300—600), capable of covering the same distances, but
able to take off at higher loads if necessary, and equipped with a new, larger and
more modern wing unit and with 60,000/62,000-lbs (27/28-ton)-thrust engines. A
plane like this will be substantially more economical to operate than the current
3-jet types, and will be able to carry more fre.‘r in its holds than the 8-747.

From the technical standpoint, Airbus Industrie obviously plans also to make

the most extensive possible use (applying the experience it has acquired on the
A-310) of composite materiaes based on carbon fibers and Kevlar fibers, and of
modern systems which will also have proven themselves in actual use on the A-310
(digital avionics in particular, interchangeable cathode-ray screens, new-
generation Garrett GTCP 331-250 APU's [Auxiliary Power Units], etc). One of its
most interesting features, however, will be the use of a flight-control-and-fuel-
transfer system enabling flight with a retracted equilibrium trim point (see
related schematic diagram), designed to reduce trim-compensation drag, lighten the
plane(smaller tailplane), improve its lift, and thus to increase its aerodynamic
efficiency (+1 percent at takeoff), all while reducing by 2.5 percent its cruise-
rate of fuel consumption. The debut of CCV [variable cruise burn rate] thus en-
visaged, on which all the big aircraft builders are currently working, can hardly
be expected to take place in the very near term; it is perfectly projectable,
however, into the 1985-1990 timeframe.

The curves and graphs we reproduce here represent results of calculations and
preliminary evaluations that have been made by the design departments concerned.
As to the number of seats, the TA-9, with four type "A" doors on each side. could
be certificated to carry up to 440 passengers (based on emergency evacuation cri-
teria). In fact, however, the number of seats wOuld be limited by the floor area
and could not exceed 420 (in "high density' arrangement, 9 seats per row at 30
inches between rows). But with 344 seats at 33/36-inch spacing, the TA-9 will
offer the same seating capacity as a DC-lo or an L-lOll.

A study of its “payload range” criteria indicates that with a payload of over 45
tons, the TA-9, with the customary reserves, will have a cruising range of over
3,000 kilometers; with a payload of 30 tons, or 425 passengers and their baggage.
a cruising range of 2,¢00 nautical miles (¢,450 kilometers); and with 325 passen-
gers, 3,200 nautical miles (close to 6,000 kilometers). Thus, it would be usable
on virtually all the existing medium- to medium/long-haul routes.

Lastly, the calculation of fuel consumption and DOC [Direct Operating Cost] over
distances of the order of 1,850 kilometers show to what extent the TA—9 will be
superior to the current twinv, 3-, and t-engine jets. Moreover, it will have no
competitor, since a 0-767, even in an extensively elongated version, could ob-
viously not offer comparable capacity.

in its next issue, AIR ET COSMOS will examine the Airbus long-range subfamily:
the TA-ll and TA-lZ.

New Airbus Industrie balance Sheet
Egyptair has just increased from 7 to 8 its firm orders for A-300's. The addi-

tional plane, an A-JOO 84-200, powered by General Electric CP6-50C2 engines is
scheduled for delivery in the summer of 1983.

The Egyptian airline is currently using five A-300's. two of which are under lease

to it. Its own fourth and fifth planes will be delivered this summer, and its
sixth and seventh in the spring of 1983.

As of 4 January, Airbus Industrie had booked orders on hand for a total of 503
planes, of which 344 are firm orders and 159 are options. of this total, 325 or-
ders (256 + 69) are for A—300's and 178 orders (68 + 90) are for A-3lO's. A3 of
that date, the number of planes yet to be delivered totaled 345.
