2. Inspection Rules

2.1 In order to test the compliance of the EKG's with the requirements of the
instant standard. the manufacturing enterprise must conduct state. acceptance.
periodical and standard tests.

2.2 State testing of EKG's is governed by 608T 8.001-—72.

2.3 Each EKG is subjected to acceptance testing for compliance with the

requirements of pars 1-22. table 1: 1.12: 1.1! (except for testing for resistance
to climatic and mechnical influences).

2.“ EKG's from among those which passed acceptance testing are subjected to
periodical testing. Periodical testing is conducted once annually on three EKG‘s
for compliance with all requirements of the instant standard except for par.
1.1a. and once every three years on eight EKG's for compliance to par 1.1!. If
during periodical testing the noncompliance of an EKG with at least one of the
requirements of the instant standard is established. the test results are
considered unsatisfactory. and repeat testing of a doubled number of test
specimens for the complete program must be performed. The results of repeat
testing are conclusive.

2.5 when the model. design. materials or industrial manufacturing process is
changed. standard testing of EKG's is performed on three axn's for compliance with
all requirements of the instant standard. except for compliance with par. 1.1a.
and on eight EKG's for compliance with the requirements of par. 1.1a. If during
standard testing for compliance with all requirements of the instant standard
except for par 1.1U. the EKG's do not meet at least one of the requirements.
repeat tests are conducted on a doubled number for the complete program.

3. Methods of Testing

3.1 The basic parameters of the EKG's are tested using a source of a signal of
subsonic and low frequencies having an output signal in the form of a sinusoid and
a sequence of orthogonal pulses and separate serrate pulses. Measurement on the
recording is performed using rulers with a scale division of 0.5 an. Measurement
of dimensions of less than 15 mm is performed using rulers with a scale division
of no less than 0.1 mm. No allowance is made for the width of the recording line
(fig 2).

3.2 The test signal to the input of the EKG channel is fed through the lead cable
at any of the electrocardiographic leads which may be commutated to a given
channel. As this takes place. the value of the mean level of constant voltage of
any polarity between each of the pairs of active electrodes and the neutral

electrode must be no less than 100 mV. and between the active electrodes-not less
than 50 mV.

of failures equal to zero in compliance with GOST 13216-67. Test conditions are
governed by GOST 13216-67. After every100 hours of operation the EKG's are tested
for compliance with the requirements of table 1 using the methods of para
3.7-3.19. An EKG is considered to have passed reliability testing if not one
failure occurred during the test period.

During reliability testing. each contact of the commutating unit must close no
less than 30 times in 8 hours of uninterrupted operation.

3.21 The rejection coefficient (see note to table 1) is tested at all positions
of the lead switch at a sensitivity of 10 mm/mV. The terminals of the lead cables
connected to the active electrodes are connected through resistors of 5 kilgio
percent to a common point. when sinusoidal voltage at 100 mV (from peak to peak)
is fed between this point and the ground at any frequency within the range of 0.05

to 100 Hz. the amplitude of the signal on the recording (from peak to peak) must
not exceed 1 mm.

3.22 The drop in the peak of the transient response (par 22. table 1) is
determined at the maximum sensitivity of the EKG's and a rate of recording medium
movement equal to 50 mm/s. by recording a discontinuity in constant voltage fed to

the input at first positive. then negative. polarity. The duration of feeding of
the voltage must be no shorter than 5 seconds.

Plotting is done on the recording (fig 7). and linear dimensions hi and his are
measured. The transient response of each channel must be a monotonic. inverted
curvature to the side of the zero line and must not intersect it.

The drop in the peak o-is determined according to the formula:

Electrical Equivalent of the Subject

The electrical equivalent of the subject (228) is used in determining error in
measurement of amplitude. the coefficient of relative asymmetry. equivalent

resistance of inphase interference. the drift rate of the zero line and the
internal noise level.

A diagram of the connection of the EKG to the test signal source to determine the
above enumerated parameters is presented in the illustration.

The equivalents of electrode full resistance consist of condensers and resistors
connectgd in parallel. The values of capacitance and active resistance directed
to 1 cm of surface of the electrode interfacing with the uninjured skin of the
person being examined are given in the table presented below.

The values of the capacitances and active resistances for the full resistances
presented in the chart are determined according to the formulas:

lText-l- Introduction. The development of scientifically substantiated measures
aimed at preventing the pollution of the environment with mutagens is one of the
immediate tasks of environmental protection in the genetic aspect.

Such a task requires a mass check for mtagenicity of widespread chemical conpounds.
as well as those planned for an extensive use. including pesticides, for the pur-
pose of detecting and identifying genetically active substances and distributing
them according to the degree of potential mtagenic hazard.

The authors were guided by the indicated objective during the performance of this
investigation devoted to an initial evaluation of the potential mtagenic hazard
of 22 pesticides--representatives of nine classes of chenical compounds-an the
basis of the results of theiLcytogeaetic study on mice in accordance with the
principle proposed earlier j_l/, modified in the course of parforsmnce of this in-
vestigation and briefly set forth in a refined form in the presented report.

Material and methods. the substances for the investigation were selected on the
basis of a list of pesticides recomended for application in agriculture by the
State Commission on Chemical Agents for the Control of Pasta and Diseases of Plants
and Needs. The list of the studied preparations is presented in table l.

The initial check of pesticides for mtageniaity was made by the method of meta-
phase analysis of bone marrow cells of white nonline mice. which meet most of the
requirements placed upon an object used for mass investigations (relatively low
material expenditures, simplicity. availability. good reproducibility of results
and a sufficient rate of chromosome analysis). The cytogenetic activity of sub-
stances was studied on 2- to 3-month old male mice. Chromosome preparations were
rude by Ford's standard method in our modification. Pesticides were studied with
a single intragastric administration (in the form of a suspension on milk or wa-
ter emlsion) and bone marrow fixation 20 hours after the effect. Some substances

were studied after a daily fivefold administration. The amount of the mimm dose
of preparations depended on the degree of their toxicity and in each specific case
vas~l/2-l/S L050. when a mtagenic effect was detected. the study of pesticides
continued up to the ineffective dose. A total of 33,100 netaphasss vsre investi-
gated, including 2,000 in control ani-ls. The difference between the frequency

of aberrant cells in experimental and control groups of nice was evaluated by stand-
ard statistical methods £7.

Results of investigations and their discussion. The evaluation of the potential
genetic hazard of pesticides can be based on the principle of deternination of the
nutagenic potential of substances according to the following three paramters,
which we suggested earlier: degree of manifestation of the effect. level of effec-
tive doses and universality of the mtagenic effect E. The results of the study
of the cytogenetic effect of pesticides on mall-ale can serve as the basis for their
initial evaluation according to the first two indicated criteria.

The degree of manifestation of the effect is an indicator reflecting the relation-
ship between the induced and control levels of mtations. which is established ac-
cording to the excess of the induced effect over the control level ultiple to it
and in case of a significant difference is quantitatively equal to this Inltiplic-
ity. In accordance with this the degree of manifestation of the effect can have
the following values: 0--when differences with control are insignificant; l--when
the control level is exceeded significantly; 2--when the twofold control level is
exceeded significantly; n--when the n-fold control level is exceeded significantly.
If the bone narrow of animals as the object of investigation is designated with the
letter syon "B." the numerical index in it will correspond to the degree of un-
ifestation of the effect (50... n)'

The level of effective dose, which. according to the scheme presented in table 2,
is determined according to the minimal effective dose with due regard for the deg-
ree of its toxicity is the second indicator of the cytogenetic activity of pesti-
cides. The degree of toxicity is evaluated with respect to Lngo and is designated
as "A" with a dose ssaller than or equal to 1/5 “’50 and as "a' with a dose exceed-
ing 1/5 L050.

given on the basis of en snslysie of the codinetions of these besic indices

(6.— 6.; As—Au. as- a.) altogether determining the degree of cytogenetic sc—
tivity of s substance. 0n the basis of different cosbinstion variants convention-
ally it is possible to single out six groups of pesticides differing in the deg-

ree of cytogenetic activity and, therefore. in the degree of potential mtsgenic
hazard (table 3).

ltcan be seen from the results of the study of the cytogenetic effect of pestici-
des on bone narrow cells of nice (table 5) that nine substances—hetanal. pirinor,
(alkyl ethers of aryl carbanic acid); alipur, vernal. sutan (thiocarbsnic acid de-
rivatives); prefix, propanid. ranrod (carborylic acid derivatives) and acres: (phe-
nol derivative)-induced a significant increase in the frequency of aberrant nets-
phases as cowsred with control.

As can be seen from the data presented in table 6. these pesticides differ in the
degree of potential mtagsnic hazard.

Ranrod should he considered the nost hazardous (group 1). Its naximn cytogenetic
effect (6.52) exceeded the threefold control level significantly and the minimum
effective dose (10 Ig/kg. 251/30 L050) pertained to the fourth level of effective
doses.

Pirinor can be included in group II. It induced a cytogenetic effect in a wide
range of doses. including in relatively low (both in terns of weight and toxicity)
quantities. The nini-na effective dose of pirinor was 2 Ila/kg (gal/50 mm). The
naxiunn effect (3.12) exceeded the twofold control level significantly.

hetanal and screw: also induced a significant excess over the twofold control level.
However. their ninisun effective doses corresponded to the third level of effec-
tive doses, which gave reasm to include these pesticides in group III. It should
be noted that hetanal induced genome mtations. significantly increasing the fre-
quency of polyploid netsphaaes in the bone narrow of nice.

Propanid was included in group IV. It induced a significant excess over the con-
trol level only in the dose of 100 ng/kg. amounting to 1/5 [.05 (it is the mini-
mn effective dose and corresponds to the third level of effecgive doses).

Alipur, vernsm. sutan and prefix induced a cytogenetic effect of the first degree
of manifestation only in high doses (SOC-1.000 ng/kg), which in all cases exceeded
1/5 1.0 0' This gave reason to assume the nonspecific nature of this effect and to
includ the indicated pesticides in so-called "doubtful mtagens" (group V).

A total of 13 pesticides did not have a mtagenic effect on bone narrow cells of
nice and on the basis of the results of the cytogenetic study were included in
group VI as the least hazardous compounds.

It should be noted that the conclusion on the degree of potential genetic hazard
of the investigated pesticides drawn on the basis of their cytogenetic investiga-
tion is tentative and to some extent relative, which is due to the difficulty of
presently introducing a paraneter asking it possible to evaluate the universality
of the mtagenic effect. Therefore, at this stage of investigations the practical
recounendatians with regard to the studied comounds can be only of a temporary
conoronising nature with a tendencv toward undersetinstins pesticides as conno-
nents of the mtagenic background of the environment.

[Article by E. V. Lapayev and G. I. Pavlov]

[Text] The article reports the data of investigations of Soviet
and foreign scientists in which it was shown that the action of
the most common factors of space flight (acceleration.
weightlessness. noise. vibration) result in change in the
functional condition of the vestibular analyzer. The authors

present several theories which explain the etiopathogenesis of
adverse reactions. predominantly of vestibular origin. which
develop in cosmonauts.

The influence of the most common factors of space flight (acceleration.

weightlessness. noise and vibration) has an adverse effect on the human organism
and may serve as a cause of reduced fitness for work.

The peculiar functional condition of the vestibular analyzer is considered one of
the chief features of the development of such conditions (particularly during the
first day of flight).

The most important factors of space flight. the action of which is directly
referred to the vestibular analyzer. are acceleration and weightlessness.

It is well known that gravitation underlies the physiological mechanisms of
orientation on Earth. All organisms. with the except of the most primitive. react
to gravitation either by change in form or change in posture and locomotion. A
special organ for perception of gravitation-the vestibular analyzer. which to a
great extent ensures spatial orientation-was created in vertebrates and man.

Man and animal easily endure the influence of low intensity acoeleration-1. 1.5
gf (Smith and Burton. 1971). which. as a rule. does not produce any biological
changes. The mechanism of homeostasis promotes adaptation to it. More intense
acceleration induces biological stress. which is manifested by obvious
pathological disorders.

Experiments with animals on a centrifuge have demonstrated that changes in posture

are noted in then after prolonged rotation. In acne. termination of the action of
acceleration is accompanied by transient disorientation. and ataxia. opisthotonus
and sonersaulting are observed (Smith and Kelly. 1959: Burton and Smith. 1965).
This condition. caused by decreased acceleration. may be arrested by resumption of
rotation in the centrifuge. In the opposite case. the indicated postural

terrestrial gravitation. The absence of nystaglus in these cases shows that the
described disturbances are not associated with stilulation of the semicircular
canals. it the same time the characteristic inverted position of the head makes
it possible to hypothesize that stimulation of the otolithic receptor is the cause
of the disorientation. ataxia opisthotonus and somersaulting. A similar
phenomenon-"the illusion of reversed position'-is noted in a number of people
during short term weightlessness and has also been explained (Graybiel and Kelly.
1967) in terms of the features of the function of the otolithic apparatus.

post-rotational nystagnus change (Yuganov and Gorshkov. 196E; Yuganov. 1965). It
has been proved that any influence of overloads of constant intensity. as well as
the very process of increasing the intensity of overload. results in activation of

interactions of the cupular and otolithic apparatuses under conditions of
increased gravitation (the action of overloads). with respect to the

flights may be induced both by the absence of gravitational stimulation of the
otoliths and by possible stimulation of the semicircular canals during movement of
the head and body (Yuganov. 1965). In weightlessness the otolithic organs react
to changes in acceleration (Gerathewohl. 1963). After an initial increase in
activity in the transitional period. they adapt to zero acceleration. and their
bioelectrical activity decreases (Gualtierotti and Bracchi. 1971). Observations
during parabolic flights have demonstrated that the manifestation of such
reactions as nausea and vomiting are determined by the function of the labyrinth
(Graybiel. 1970). Reactions to Coriolis acceleration usually arise in people with
normal labyrinths and do not arise in individuals with labyrinth defects (Colehour
J.. 1968). The illusion of “revolution“ also develops only in individuals with a
normally functioning labyrinth (Gauer. et al.. 1961).

Symptoms of illusory sensations and motion sickness during space flight developed
in the astronauts of the “Apollo“ spacecraft (Berry. 1973). Illusions of rotation.
unpleasant sensations in the stomach. nausea and vomiting were observed.

Unpleasant sensations were also experienced by Soviet astronauts. It is possible
that this was caused by the fact that in the absence of gravitation. abnormal
afferent signals create a false sensation of rocking and falling and. subsequently.
sensations of gastric discomfort. vertigo and nausea. Hydromechanical processes
in the semicircular canals also may facilitate the development of spatial
illusions. especially sensations of rotation and inverted position (SJoberg. 1970;
Dzendollet. 1971).

The results of soviet cosmonauts' and American astronauts‘ space flights indicate
that motion sickness developing in some degree of gravitation may be a factor
accompanying the state of weightlessness. Deterioration of fitness for work may
be a result of this. Thus. during the two first flights to the Skylab Station.
the astronauts' work activity was complicated by the development of motion
sickness. In some of them the symptoms of this disease developed after they
entered the work compartment of the station and after splashdown. The symptoms
were observed for 3-5 days in the compartments of the station. although the
combination of two drugs (scopolamine and amphetamine) served as a reliable
protective measure. An attack of motion sickness also took place on the flight of
the third Skylab team. The cause of the decrease in fitness for work is change on

the part of a number of the organism's organs and systems. primarily the peculiar
functional state of the vestibular analyzer in weightlessness. This condition

results in the development of a complex of motion sickness symptoms with
practically complete resemblance to sea or air sickness.

One of the most likely causes of the development of space motion sickness is
considered to be the influence of Coriolis acceleration of low intensity and long
duration against the background of the increasing excitability of the receptor
formations of the semicircular canals as the result of weakening of the inhibiting
effects of the otolithic apparatus owing to its "functional shutdown."

The shutdown of otolithic apparatus function is recognized as the most likely

hypothesis for explaining the mechanisms of the development of adverse
vestibular-vegetative disorders (Parin et al.. 1962; Sisakyan et al.. 1962). Also
fairly widespread are the views that under these conditions. change develops in

75

the nature and extent of otolithic apparatus stimulation: this change is primarily
manifested in a decrease in this stimulation (Parin et al.. 1962). Likewise
expressed is the viewpoint that under conditions of weightlessness the otolithic
apparatus is in a state of peculiar "negative" stimulation (Yuganov. 1965). which
in turn affects the activation of the vegetative reflexes from the semicircular
canals when the latters are stimulated (Yuganov and Lapayev. 1968).

H. D. Yemel'yanov (1968) feels that there are enough conditions in space flight to
disturb the activity of the system of spatial analyzers and that the condition of
the higher branches of the central nervous system is the unifying source of such
disturbances. The author suggests that the predominance of the stimulating
processes in the cerebral cortex under conditions of space flight is conducive to
the development of illusory sensations and vegetative disorders.

Thus. the above said suggests that some authors explain the development of the
disorders mentioned as the action of weightlessness as an adequate or inadequate
vestibular stimulus. and others. as a disturbance.occurr1n8 in weightlessness. of

the interaction between the otolithic and cupular system or sensory systems
providing human spatial orientation.

Some studies present materials on the effect on the vestibular analyzer of
hemodynamic changes under the influence of the absence of gravitation. It has
been demonstrated that the vestibular analyzer does not remain indifferent to changes
of this sort. particularly in redistribution of blood and development of the
hypertensive syndrome (Bryanov et al.. 1975). Authors feel that the disturbance
of hemodynamics with certain microcirculatory disorders on the tissular and
microcellular levels. the hypertensive trend of shifts and the disturbances in the
water-salt metabolism with tissular unbalance of potassium and calcium ions create
the most favorable background for the development of vestibular-vegetative
disorders in weightlessness. Against this background. they believe. it is
completely possible for pronounced reactions to develop. even in response to

threshold and subthreshold vestibular stimuli produced by the motion of the head
and trunk during space flight.

The correctness of this and other theories explaining the genesis of vestibular
disorders is controversial. but the development of symptoms of motion sickness to
some extent during space flight in a number of cases is unquestionable.

It should be noted. however. that one of the most likely vestibular stimuli which
may take place in orbital flight is angular acceleration and Coriolis acceleration
(Khilov. 196”). They arise during the individual's movements inside the cabin of
the vehicle or during unstabilized movement of the latter.

In weightlessness the gravitational forces are absent. So-called immanent
accelerations. which arise when work is performed. change a person's apparent
weight slightly but have important significance inasmuch as they stimulate the

extralabyrinthine mechanoreceptors and consequhntly increase the flow of impulses
to the nerve centers.

Sidelnikov. Solodovnik (1975) feel that the manifestation of vestibulo-vegetative
disorders in brief weightlessnessand under the conditions of space flight

basically are a function of two factors: the first is the level of vestibular
stability and the second is the level of motor activity of the cosmonaut's head.
The combination of these two conditions made it possible to divide all people
according to level of vestibular stability under conditions of weightlessness into
four groups:

The first group is individuals who do not experience motion sickness in
weightlessness. even with high motor activity of the head;

The second group is individuals who experience motion sickness only with high
motor activity of the head:

The third group is individuals who experience motion sickness in weightlessness
when the head performs a required minimum of movement (in order to perform
necessary operator activities);

The fourth group is individuals who experience motion sickness in weightlessness
in an immobile state.

At rest and when the head is immobilized physiological deafferentation of the
otholithic apparatus with subsequent disappearance of tonic. and maintenance of
spontaneous or background. impulsation is entirely possible.

Rotating movements of the head provide the same stimulus for the seaicircular
canals as under terrestrial conditions, but brief linear accelerations developing
under these conditions do not cause adequate stimulation of the otolithic
apparatus. This information cannot be used either for orientation relative to the
vertical. or for correlation with afferentation from the semicircular canals.
Thus. of all the vestibular extralabyrinthine mechanoreceptors only the

semicircular canals are stimulated. essentially by normal movement of the head
under terrestrial conditionsand in the state of weightlessness alike.

Estimates show that the physical intensity of this stimulus does not exceed 3-10 5
gf (Galle), 1968). The possibility of significant increase in the strength and
duration of a given type of vestibular stimulus is due to the promising creation
of artificial gravitational forces during interplanetary space flights for the
purpose of prophylaxis of undesirable consequences of prolonged stays by man in
conditions of weightlessness. It is possible that in the near future artificial
gravitation will be produced by the rotation of space stations. In this case.
constructions for maintaining normal postural movement at one-third of terrestrial
gravitation are adequate to avoid undesirable consequences of angular and Coriolis

accelerations arising in the process (Yugannov and Afanas'yev. 1964: Yuganov and
Pavlov. 1967; Yuganov et al.. 1968).

The results of studies performed in the USSR investigating the effects of
low-intensity acceleration of long duration on the human organism make it possible

to consider a velocity of 21.2 degrees/s the maximum endurable angular velocity of
rotation.

Along with Coriolis acceleration, rotation and angular acceleration of different
intensities and durations may also act on the coamonaut's organism. Cosmonauts

77

may encounter the effect of their action during unstabilized flight of the
spacecraft and also during ejection. Studies in this direction are basically
devoted to searching for the maximum endurable intensities of angular velocities
and accelerations according to the time of their action and at different positions
of the subject to the axis of rotation.

0f the studies of the latter trend. 8. s. Harkaryan's series of works (1963. 1965.
1969) must be noted. Harkaryan conducted a study of the reactions of a number of
organs and systems of the organism under the action on man of angular velocities
of 0.26 to 2 rev/s with exposure of up to 20 min and with the trunk inclinated 20.
30. as. 65. 80 and 90 degrees backwards from the vertical axis and lying in a
supine position. when the axis of rotation passed through the region of the head
or foot. The author investigated the functions of the vestibular analyzer under
these conditions. as well as certain indicators of the activity of the
cardiovascular and respiratory systems. It was established that increase in the
time of the influence and intensity of angular velocities results in a rise in the
duration of post-rotation nystagmus and illusions of counter-rotation. with a
negative effect on reading of the aeronavigational instruments and the symbols of
(Kholinoy)'s table. it the same time an increase in angular velocities from 30

degrees to 120 degrees/s resulted in a decrease in the duration of the illusion of
counter-rotation.

The function of the vestibular apparatus is associated with the function of other
systems of the organism. Under conditions of weightlessness predominance of the
influence of the vagus nerve is sometimes observed. This influence is expressed
in bradycardia and gastro-intestinal disorders. which may cause nausea and a
feeling of discomfort. At the same time it is known that a stay in weightlessness
affects blood circulation and the locomotor apparatus. The combination of all
these disturbances may to a still great extent be responsible for the
manifestation of symptoms of motion sickness in cosmonauts.

Vestibular stability may also be a function of the conditions of the cosmonaut's
stay in a vehicle with a modified gaseous atmosphere. It has been established
that respiration of air containing uo-na percent oxygen and 2 percent carbon
dioxide may increase vestibular stability. At the same time. the presence of only
10.5 percent oxygen in the inhaled air decreases vestibular stability in
individuals with latent vestibular instability (Harkaryan and Sidel'nikov. 197a.
1975; Sidel'nikov. Harkaryan, 197R. et al.).

with increase in flight time new problems may also arise. This circumstance
increases the significance of future research connected with the action of
weightlessness on the human organism. In this connection one of the important
tasks of future biomedical research is the study of nervous reflex and sensory
changes associated with the condition of weightlessness and transition to it.

Particular attention must specifically be given to cases of development of motion
sickness. which is chiefly a function of vestibular reactions to weightlessness.

Recently the view was expressed that motion sickness is the manifestation of a
pronounced crisis of parasympathetic nature developing under prolonged stimulation
of certain afferent systems (visual. auditory, interoceptive, etc.). chiefly the

78

FOR‘OFFKJAI.USE10NLY

vestibular. in people having constitutionally acquired insufficiency of the
limbico-reticular system (Yuganov. Solodovnik. 1976). The connection between
individual susceptibility to motion sickness on Earth and in weightlessness is
still unclear (Graybiel. et al.. 1973): the combined action of weightlessness and
other environmental conditions. such as microclimate. sensory deprivation. limited
nobility and emotional factors. is also unknown.

Presently existing high gravitation engines for piloted space flights entail the
development of noise and vibration factors which raise the problem of protecting
the crew of the spacecraft from them.

The fields of acoustical energy created by space systems have a sufficiently high
level and may disturb normal human activity. cause auditory disturbances. reduce
fitness for work. alter physiological functions. etc.

The reactions of the auditory analyzer play the leading role among the
physiological effects of the action of noise. Their influence on the vestibular
apparatus has not been ruled out. however. Subjective reports of disorientation.
vertigo. nausea and disturbances in postural balance indicate that high intensity
acoustical energy may be a stimulus to the vestibular apparatus (Borshchevskiy. et
al.. 1967). Studies substantiating the causes of vestibular responses to the
action of noise indicate that the vestibular apparatus may be the object of
acoustical stimulation (Parker. et al.. 1968; Harris. 1971).

In addition to the vestibular apparatus. noise levels of 1&0 dB or more also act
on other sensory systems and possibly cause a drop in fitness for work of reflex
activity of the mechanoreceptors and proprioceptors (Yugsnov. et al.. 1966; Krylov
et al.. 1968). Regardless of the mechanism of direct influence of intensive noise
on the auditory apparatus or on the auditory apparatus and the mechanoreceptors.
the presence of complaints of loss of orientation. vertigo. nausea and other

symptoms indicate the stimulating effect of acoustical energy on the vestibular
system.

In orbital space flight noises arising during operation of different assemblies
and life support systems act continuously on the cosmonaut. In prolonged flight
the factor of the uninterrupted nature of the influence has a substantial
significance (Krylov. 1965).

During flight on a spacecraft. considerable vibration may arise (Guisnard 1972);
this vibration is caused by the operation of the main engines and the functioning
of the auxiliary power equipment.

Vibration is transmitted to the cosmonaut directly through supporting surfaces
such as the seat. headrest and control lever. The main parameters of vibration.
which determine its influence on man are frequency. intensity (amplitude).
direction with respect to the anatomical parts of the body and the duration of
influence.

The posture in which the cosmonaut is positioned and secured in his seat is
conducive to the transmission of spacecraft vibrations to the trunk and head
without damping (Taub. 1966; Schoenberger. 1968). Despite the high thrust of the

rocket during the launching of the Apollo spacecraft. vibrations arising at that
time were noted by the astronauts. but no serious discomfort was caused (Berry.
1969).

In weightlessness. the flight seems motionless and smooth. however. vibrations
from secondary sources. such as the life support systems. for example. say be
noted visually or by touching the inner sheathing of the vehicle. Even at low

intensity. when constantly active during prolonged space flght. the vibrations lay
lead to undesirable consequences.

The dermal receptors serve as the main vibration-sensitive formations; they
contain vibrotactile sensory elements (McIntyre. 1965; Hoore. 1966).
mechanoreceptors lying in the deeper structures (particularly in the muscles.
tendons. Joints and internal organs) (McIntyre. 1965; Guignard. 1972) and the
vestibular apparatus (Borshchevskiy. Krylov; Benson. 1965: Guignard. 1972).

It is known from the data in the literature that undesirable reactions of
vestibular origin may arise during fluctuations from velocities of 0.1 to 1 Hz
(Guignard. 1912). Accumulation of such fluctuations may result in the development
or stronger manifestation of notion sickness sysptoms. The manifestation of these
symptoms depends on the individual's original condition.

Flight experience. as well as certain laboratory experiments. have shown that
strong low-frequency vibration may also disturb human fitness for work in a

nonspecific manner. following the pattern of a distracting and fatiguing agent
like noise (Guignard. 1972).

The enumerated factors of space flight may act both independently and in
combination with each other and with other factors. In the case of combined
action of stress factors, as often occurs in space flight. additive synergistic or
antagonistic effects may develop (K. K. Ioseliani. 1967: Grether. 1970; Wilkinson.
1969: Guignard. 1972; Harris and Sonar. 1973).

Thus. the studies of Soviet and foreign authors have shown that the action of the
most cannon dynamic factors of space flight (acceleration. weightlessness. noise.
vibration) result in perceptible shifts in the functional condition of the
vestibular apparatus. This in turn may result in the development of adverse
reactions. predominantly of vestibular origin; this ultilately affects the
cosmonauts' fitness for work.

MODELING PILOT CONTROL ACTIVITY
Kiev AVTOMATIKA in Russian no u. Jul-Aug 81 (manuscript received 10 Jul 80) pp 56-60

[Article by V. A. Kondratenkov]

[Text] One of the most radical means of increasing the effectiveness of the
functioning of erg control systems (508) controlling the flight of aircraft is
rational distribution of control functions between the pilot and the automatic
devices-in other words. the provision of a level of automation and (within the
scope of this level) a method of distributing functions with which the global
extremum of a given generalized criterion of the quality of the 363 is obtained
(1).

Hith a specified list of control tasks. an analytical search for a rational
distribution of functions is possible only when models of pilot behavior
corresponding to the given list are available as parts of the ECS. Here it is
very important for the pilot behavior models to be sensitive to the level of
difficulty of performing the control process. since the "human component” of the
optimized. generalized quality criterion is most commonly the pilot's level of
psychophysiological tension.

without setting ourselves the goal of critical analysis of known and widespread
models of pilot behavior. we shall note that models based on the methods of
statistical identification of the pilot's transmission function (2, 3) and the
method of generalized work characteristics of the human operator (n) are the lost
appropriate for solving the task of the analytical search for a distribution of
control functions. Use of these methods. however. is significantly limited by the
requirement of observability of the pilot's "input coordinates." i.e.. it may be
applied only to a narrow class of control tasks in solving which the pilot
receives information only from instrumental displays. Moreover. the methods of
statistical identification require the presence of a steady state quality in the
random processes of adjustment of the control levers by the pilot-something that
occurs in extremely rare cases-and do not give the pilot behavior models
information on the "human component."

Another method is presented for modeling the behavior of a pilot performing the
process of aircraft flight control. proper. i.e.. stabilization of specified and
generally variable values of the flight parameters. This method. which is free of

the above noted limitations. is based on current concepts in engineering
psychology concerning the mechanisms of the action of the pilot's psychological

structures in flight control. namely: regardless of the nature of the information
presented. the pilot responds with a suitable adjustment y(t) of the control level
to the appearance of discrepancies between the conceptual flight model (i.e.. the
system of notions of how the flight should proceed) and the operational flight
pattern (i.e.. the system of notions of how the flight is. in fact. proceeding)
(5). Modeling of the random processes y(t) of adjustment of the control levers
equivalent to the given discrepancy between the conceptual model and the

operational flight pattern will hereinafter be called modelng of pilot control
activity.

As indicated by analysis of realizations yk(t) of random processes y(t) recorded
by the flight information recorders of the aircraft. the y(t) are generally

nonsteady-state processes. It is also generally impossible to express yk(t)
through a given steady-state random function.

hence the following transform was used:

ym-nm+Ln (n

where Yk(t) is the random. generally nonsteady-state function obtained by applying

0
to the y (t) an operation equivalent to low-frequency filtration: yk(t) is the
centere function satisfying the steady-state and normal ergodicity tests.

The component Yiét) may be regarded as deliberate. basic adjustment of the control
lever for the purpose of eliminating discrepancies between the conceptual flight
model and the operational flight pattern (6). Statistical analysis of
nonsteady-state random processes Y (t) demonstrated that their frequency structure
is not due to the performance of t e aircraft as an object of control.
consequently. to the level of the difficulty of performing the control process
for the pilot. This was noted by n. A. Kotik (7). who established that the more
experience the pilot has. the closer in size are the integral ratings ' 0)dt‘
But owing to (1) g y.

it follows that as the pilot acquires experience the component Yk(t) bears
increasingly less information about the pilot. hence. it is no accident that we

propose replacing an experienced. trained pilot performing adjustment Y(t) of the
control lever with an optimal controller.

As the research shows. the "human component“ is introduced to pilot control

activity by the component y(t) (owing to the ergodicity of y (t). we drop the 'k'
index) which is a combination of adjusting and maintaining ISVemants. as well as

The values a}. a and 5 proved to be extremely sensitive to the performance of the

aircraft as an object of control and minimal in the range of performance values
optimal for the pilot (weather conditions. the proximity of the Earth. the size of

the angle of bank during turns. the take-off and landing mass of the aircraft.
etc.).

The idea occurs of modeling pilot control activity by a combination of reactions
Y(t) of the optimal controller to discrepancies between the conceptual flight

model and the operational flight pattern and 3(t) reactions of the shaper filter
to a wide-band signal. for example. to ”white noise." Consequently. the described
method of modeling pilot behavior consists of synthesizing the controller with the
output coordinate ﬁt) and the shaper filter which transforms ''white noise" into a
random signal with spectral density (2).

Synthesis of the controller with the output coordinate ﬁt) is essentially a
simple procedure when information is available on the input signal. in our
case--concerning the nature and size of the discrepancy between the conceptual
flight model and the operational flight pattern. Statistical analysis of the
components of Y (t) relating to the different elements of flight made it possible
to observe the following two features.

First. under transitional control conditions. characterized by significant changes
in Y(t). the Yk(t) curves may be regarded as the reaction of some dynamic system
to a standard signal in the form of a stepwise function or orthogonal pulse

Thus it is possible to accept the hypothesis that the discrepancy

between the conceptual flight model and the operational flight pattern is for the

pilot a standard input signal in the form of a stepwise function or orthogonal
pulse.

Second. using factor analysis. it is possible to establish the basic parameters
which determine the nature of change in the transient functions Yk(t) (but which
do not affect their frequency structure). The significance of the amplitude of
the discrepancy between the conceptual flight model and the operational flight
pattern is assigned to the X values of these parameters. Aircraft mass during

The following method may conveniently be used in obtaining models of realization
by the pilot of component Y (t).

First of all. it is necessary to have a sufficiently representative group of
realizations Y (t). k:1. 2..... n. performed by pilots of a roughly identical
level of training in solving an identical task of piloting and corresponding to
one value x1. i=l,2...,l, of a basic parameter of the given piloting task.
Computing the average for the group from n realizations and 3ttributing it to
value X . we obtain a unitary. averaged. transient function r,gt). Performing
this sa e operation with groups of realizations corresponding to 1 values of the
basic parameters. we obtain 1 unitary averaged transient functions. If all of the
1 functions are sufficiently_close to each other. it is expedient to obtain a
relative transient function Y(t) as the average of l unitary averaged transient
functions.

Synthesis of the transmission function of the controller which realizes the
transient function Y(t). may be accomplished by known methods based on
approximation of Y(t) by solving differential equation (9). assuming that the
input influence of the controller is unitary.

The task of synthesizing the shaper filter which transforms a wide-band random
process into a process with spectral density (2) is comparatively simple. since
spectral density (2) is a rational function of frequency a. Two conditions of
physical feasibility of the required shaper filter-the continuity of function

5:0”, and the (Peli-Vinera) condition (10)—are met automatically. since the

denominator (2) has no real root. and the (Peli-Vinera) condition amounts to a
Ina

requirement that the expression Ia—Eﬁ be bounded when there is an unbounded
increase in 0. What is more. it can be shown that the required shaper filter
is minimum-phase. Then. using method (11). we obtain an expression for the
transmission function W5(p) of the shaper filter which transforms a "white noise“
signal with an intensity of "0 into a signal with spectral density (2):

where 0:.a.ﬂ are values in expression (2).

Thus. the parameters of the shaper filter (3) are a function of the pilot's
tension level.

Let us cite the example of synthesis of a model of the control activity of a pilot
turning an aircraft by coordinated deflection of the control lever in the elevator

( y.U) ) and the aileron ( 950) ) channels. In order to obtain a model. we
selected groups of realizations Yk (t). corresponding to performance of turns by
experienced pilots at practically kidentical values of flight altitude and velocity
and engine operating conditions. Only the values of the angle of bank 1. were
different. thus the value of ‘Y was taken as the basic parameter.

Relative transient functions were determined for the transient turn conditions:

[Text] Section 1
Chapter 1. Pressing Problems of Emotional Stress

The conception of H. Selye [87, 88], the initial theses of which were formulated
as far back as 1937, concerning stress deals primarily with its endocrine and bio-
chemical aspect. Ihe term, "stress," introduced by that author referred to the
general adaptation syndrome which develops in an organism in response to various
stimuli. "Nonspecificity" of reactions arising in response to any stressor,
regardless of its nature, is the most typical feature of this syndrome. In all
such cases, which are associated with a change in the body's defense systems, a
stereotype reaction appears in the form of faster pulse, respiration, palpitations
and elevation of arterial pressure. These changes are associated with intensifi-
cation of activity of the hypothalsmo-pituitsry complex whichSOCreteBASTB which,
in turn, "prompts" the adrenal cortex to produce corticoid hormones.

As a rule, these reactions take place in three stages: l)_brief “alarm reaction,"
"call to arms" of defenses of the organise; 2) stage of adaptation which, so to
speak, reveals reserves; 3) after prolonged and continuing exposure to stimuli
the achieved adaptation is again lost and the organism goes into the "depletion
stage."

Selye's theory prompted numerous studies of pituitary-adrenal correlations in the
presence of stress.

Thus, some authors [58] attribute the leading role in adaptive reactions to
stress conditions to the adrenosympathetic system, others [100] to the

88
FINICHHHCJAI.UBE1DNLN
FOI1OFFHJM1.USE!ONIN

hypothalamo-pituitary area, i.e., the junction between the nervous and endocrine
systems, while others yet attribute it to epinephrine discharged into blood which
affects the hypothalamus causing secretion of ACTH, the hormone of the anterior
hypophyseal lobe.

In the complicated complex of neurohumoral and endocrine components of the adapta-
tion syndrome of H. Selye, least studied are the relations between nervous pro-
cesses in the cortex andsubcorticaistructures of the brain.

Numerous studies of recent years proved the existence of certain correlations between
nervous and humeral processes. For example, it was established [41] that, in'the
presence of stress states, maximum concentration of certicesterene in the cerebral
cortex and hypothalamus is associated with intensified synchronization of EEG

theta waves. During specific periods, a correlation is observed between these
parameters, which is indicative of the leading role of the hypothalamus in forming
emotional states. Correlation analysis revealed that under conditions of emotional
stress there is significant increase of 3/? index on the BIG associated with
accentuation of EEG theta rhythm. The link between accentuation of autonomic re-
actions of the organism and intensification of theta activity is consistent with the
conception of P. K. Anekhin and A. I. Shumilina [8, 1111 concerning the adrena-
sympathetic basis of theta rhythm-"tension rhythm" [10].

At the present time, the humoral aspect of these mechanisms has been described com-
prehensively and thoroughly enough in numerous works and studies. However, as the
problem was studied, it became necessary to pay special attention to the nervous
mechanisms of these phenomena. In recent years, the authors of a number of scienti-
fic publications correctly indicated that stress is primarily a reaction of the
nervous system to deleterious factors, with secondary expression by changes in
autonomic and hormonal parameters [96, 89, 130, 104].

However, most authors interpret differently the nervous mechanisms of formation of
emotions.

At the start of the 20th century, the theory of James-bangs prevailed of "peri-
pheral" origin of emotions, according to which emotional sensation was related to
visceral and muscular reactions. It was indicated that emotions arising as a

result of functional changes in internal organs are the consequences of the latter,
and not their cause. These authors, who focused their attention on the ”periphery"
[139, 144], were unable to disclose the central mechanism of appearance of emotions.

The conception of central nervous substrate of formation of emotional states was
first advanced in the works of Sherringten [156], Bard [123] and Cannon [128].
They attributed the leading significance to.subcorticsl structures of the brain,
chiefly the thalamus. However, the emphasis that the authors laid on central
mechanisms of formation of emotions did not enable them to demonstrate the real
mechanism of central-peripheral correlations of emotional reactions. The common
flaw of the main theories of emotions was the lack of the biological aspect of
the question of emotional states as a valid fact of nature, as the product of
evolution that enabled animals to adapt to environmental conditions.

Accoridng to biological theory of emotions of P. K. Anokhin [9, 34], negative
emotional tensions arise when the model prepared in advance of future events, which
is programmed in the acceptor of action results, does not coincide with the

89

FOI‘0F11C1A1.USEIDNLY

parameters of the results of a behavioral act (Figure l). Emotions, as subjective
sensations, were fixed in the course of complex evolutionary development. As a
result of useful reactions, emotion changed into an inseparable part of the
organism's reaction when there was a need for food, exposure to various stimuli,
including deleterious factors. auctions enabled living things to rapidly assess
the effect on the organism of various exogenous stimuli, their endogenous needs and
results of behavioral activity. Any need is associated with a negative emotional
experience (alimentary, defense) which mobilizes the organism for action aimed at
satisfying the arising need. "Emotion is the most refined [precise] coordinated
course of central and peripheral processes..., this complex unfolds, because of
its aorphogenetic origin and physical distinctions, as an integral functional

system (Figure l) with all its inherent patterns that unite the cortex and dience-
phalic system" (P. K. Anokhin).

P. V. Simonov [90] advanced the :‘information theory of emotions." According to
this theory, the emotions of animals and man reflect the magnitude of need and
probability of satisfying it at a given time. The degree of emotional tension
(3) depends on the strength of the need (N), as well as difference between informa-
tion that is prognostically necessary to satisfy the need (In) and information
that really exists (Ir):

E - “(In - Ir)

A shortage of pragmatic information, i.e., information as to how to proceed in a
difficult situation that requires mobilization of all of the organism's forces,
leads to appearance of negative emotions that are actively minimised by the sub-
ject. And it is quite sufficient for the semantics of the goal ("acceptor of
action results") not to coincide with the actually obtained results. When the
gained information exceeds the previously present forecast [prognosis], there is
activation of the nervous system of positive emotions.

As we know, gradual approximation of a signal that is reinforced (circle) and
not reinforced (ellipse) with food, leading to a shortage of information. was used

by the Pavlovian school as one of the effective procedures for neurotization of
experimental dogs. The conception of H. H. lhananashvili [105] concerning informa-
tion neuroses discloses pathology of higher nervous activity that arises when the
brain is overloaded with information, there is a prolonged shortage of information.
as well as when it is necessary to analyse a large number of conditioned stimuli
organized in stereotype or probabi.ity systems.

Pribram [155) observes that a low probability of reinforcement by action of a need
of the organism is the cause of negatiVe emotions. This author indicates that it
is better to call emotion theory ”theory of uncertainty," or "theory of dependence
of emotions on degree of uncertainty." hodge [136] concluded, as far back as 1935,
that emotions arise when expression of an adequate response to a present situation
is impossible or doubtful. Emotion is the force of a need reflected by the brain.
Similar theoretical theses were expounded in other works [131, 122]. Thus, analysis
of the above-centioned theories and conceptions indicates that nervous and mental
factors play the leading role in the genesis of the adaptation syndrome. These
facts are reflected in the neurogenic theory of essential hypertension expounded
by P. K. Anokhin [5, 9] and G. F. Lang [56].

Thus, 6. F. Lang indicated that emotional tension of higher nervous activity leads
to attenuation of the regulatory influence of the cortex on the hypothalamus, as

a result of which excitability of the latter is heightened. Such correlations
between the cortex and hypothalamus increase descending pressor influences.

The importance of the psychophysiological aspect of emotional stress was noted at
the Stockholm Symposium on Stress [58], where attention was focused merely on
consideration of autonomic manifestations of the organism, biochemical changes in
end metabolic products in blood, etc.

The conditioned reflex method (I. P. Pavlov), which became classical, proved that
processes occurring in viscera depended on brain activity. The important role of
the cerebral cortex in function of the endogenous environment was proven by V. H.
Bekhterev [23] by the method of electric stimulation of the brain. L. A. Orbeli
[80], the author of "Theory 1f Adaptive and Trophic Role of the Sympathetic Nervous
System," made a major contribution to development of physiology and pathology of
the autonomic nervous system.

Thus, the neurogenic mechanism is important to studies of this problem.

"hat are the conditions that cause formation of emotional stress and its change
to a "static form"?

In the opinion of K. V. Sudakov [97, 98], intensive scientific and technological
progress of the last century created some serious preconditions for a rise in
neuropsychological and cardiovascular diseases. However, no "insane pace of
modern times, no acuteness of nervous vestiges can cause hypertension, if this

is indeed a pace where periods of maximum tension alternate with momenta of calm“
[97, 98b).

1. P. Pavlov [83] had already demonstrated that life is based on the enduring al-
ternation of actions, recurrent life cycles (sleep, wakefulness, work, rest, etc.)-
the dynamic stereotype. The basis of the dynamic stereotype is formation in the
brain of a certain stable sequence of rhythms of two main processes, excitation and

91
INJI<0i1ﬂC1Al.l£5E:(MVLY

inhibition. Thus, optimum conditions are created for the organism's useful adap-
tive reactions under specific, constant environmental conditions. However, I. P.
Pavlov stressed that alteration of the stereotype, particularly of its stable,

fixed form, is always associated with "tension [strain] of excitatory and inhibitory
processes."

It must be noted that tension of the organism formed under different conditions is
not a strictly pathological process [39, 401.

Brief, moderate neuropsychological tension, which developed in the course of evolu-
tion for emergency action under difficult conditions, is adequate for the organism
and takes place with utmost efficiency. This is associated with acceleration of
mental processes, which is interpreted as a sign of heightened adaptation proper-
ties of the organism with regard to stress. Under such conditions, the organism

reacts, first of all, in the form of a change in lability of nervous processes
[39. 40].

It is known [40] that moderate emotional stress has a beneficial effect on short-
term memory. H. Selye maintains that brief moderate stress is really not dangerous
to the organism. Moreover, it is necessary to condition or train the body, to
enhance its nonspecific resistance.

However, the change of emotional excitation into a "static" form is the main and
initial pathogenetic factor in formation of various pathological changes in the
organism. According to the conception of P. K. Anokhin, "static" negative emo-
tional excitation involving corticohypothalamic and limbic structures plays the
leading role in onset of essential hypertension. The cardinal theses in P. K.
Anokhin's biological theory of emotions enables us to comprehend the basic mechanism
of appearance of "static" emotional excitation leading to breakdown of the powerful
systems of self-regulation of physiological functions.

Prdongaiexcitability of nervous elements with broad involvement of other nervous
structures, progressive increase in amount of stimulating hormones in blood
"breaks" the mechanisms of self-regulation of functional systems of the organism
and changes the course of a "pathological" emotion into a chronic form, on the
order of a "vicious circle."

We know that interaction between the nervous and cardiovascular systems, which
developed as a result of many centuries of evolution, is important to implementa-
tion of normal vital functions, adaptation of the organism to rapidly changing
environmental conditions [107). However, in the last few decades, because of
information overloads, situations arise more and more often, in which man has
more "unreacted emotions" associated with nervous or mental tension, "emotional
stress" appears and leads to disruption of nervous regulation of the function of
different systems of the organism, including the cardiovascular system.

Thus, when man or animal cannot, for some reason, satisfy their social or biological
needs for a long time, they develop a sort of "conflict" that is associated with
constant build-up of dissatisfaction, irritation and emotional tension. Such
situations were named "conflict situations." A prolonged "conflict situation"
generates "emotional stress," which causes appearance of "static" negative emotional
excitation under chronic conditions [97].

FOI.0F11CJAI.USE‘ONLY

At present there are various methods for studying emotional stress in experimental
"conflict situations": the method of instrumental conditioned reactions, prolonged
intensive stimulation, repeated use of "signal” or ”nonsignal" nociceptive stimuli,
electric stimulation of emotiogenic structures of the brain, situation of antici-
pation of unpleasant factors, particularly under conditions of "prognostic
uncertainty," simultaneous presence of several emotionally significant factors, etc.

In the experiments of ﬂenry et al. [135], a "conflict situation" caused constant
fights and tension in nice, which led to persistent arterial hypertension after a
few days.

Analogous data on "conflict situations" related to anticipation of unpleasant
factors were obtained in other studies [77].

Prolonged manifestation of changes inherent in emotional stress is caused by the
presence of neuronal interaction between the prossncephalon and stem. Indeed,
exclusion of the corticoreticular element reduces significantly the duration of
the aftereffect reaction to strong nociceptive stimuli [62].

Interestingly enough, animals develop persistent tension the most often when
electrocutaneous stimulation is preceded by an instrumental reaction. The very
procedure of electrocutaneous stimulation led only to brief reactions [119, 109].
Thus, one of the mechanisms of activation and prolonged persistence of an emotional
state is conditioned reflex temporary association, which is formed very rapidly

and becomes static under the influence of 'negative” stimuli. In this case, pro-
longed retention of traces of conditioned reflex excitation indicates that emotional
states are also instrumental in activating the mechanisms of long-term memory,

thus causing prolonged persistence of pathological, obsessive reactions in the
presence of neurosis [106, 105].

It has been established that onset of emotional stress in "conflict situations" is
enhanced in the presence of other factors (cooling, psychophysical loads, immobi-
lization).

Immobilization of animals for many hours acts like a very effective psychoemotional
stressor, which elicits the typical stress reaction (rage, fear) with all its func-
tional and morphological manifestations. Immobilization of monkeys in the presence
of dominant agressive-defcnse excitation leads to extreme accentuation of negative
emotion, which is associated with circulatory disturbances. Repeated experiments
(starting with the second) led to stabilization of pathological changes. Several
authors [112] have demonstrated stabilization of changes in bioelectrical activity
of the limbico-hypothalamic structures of animals in the case of recurrent immo-
bilization stress.

The level of emotional tension and degree of its manifestation are regulated by
altering the probability of using and reinforcing signals [86]. Thus, a decrease
in number of stimuli in an integrated system that are reinforced in random order
and increase in number thereof with stereotype reinforcement diminish emotional
tension and can prevent development of neurosis. Some animals independently choose
the stereotype program of behavior, which could be interpreted as manifestation of
self-regulation of the level of emotional tension.

Rats submitted to unavoidable nociceptive stimuli preferred the half of the chamber
from which came the signal giving warning of the electric shock, which enabled them
to prepare somehow for the negative sensations [153].

Hith irregular and repeated use of an electrocutaneous stimulus, the animals were
in a constant negative emotional stress state, which led to severe dystrophic dis-
orders. Interestingly enough, in the case of random delivery of electrodermal sti-
muli (5-6 mA) the rats developed several times more ulcerations of different organs
than in experiments in a signal situation [163, 164].

Analysis of the EEG and autonoaic parameters of rabbits (1) revealed that numerous

electrodermal stimuli preceded by a photic signal led to considerably less develop-
ment of a stress state than in a situation without signals.

The data of K. V. Sudakov et a1. [97, 96] revealed that a change in EEG activity of
the cortex and subcortical structures occurred under the influence of much weaker
current when the emotiogenic centers of the hypothalamus were stimulated than the
current that induced arterial hypertension. It is apparent that emotional excita-
tion, originally appearing in the hypothalamus and spreading in ascending and des-
cending directions, is the prime factor in formation of hypertensive states.

The cited data from the literature are indicative of the important role of central
mechanisms in onset of emotional stress states. Emotional excitation arising in

the central nervous system when "conflict situations" persist for a long time
changes into the "static form." Expressly this form presents the greatest danger,
due to the continuous tonic influences of the constantly excited emotiogenic centers
on the corresponding peripheral organs. Consequently, the study of central mechan-
isms of formation of "static" negative emotions constitutes a particularly important
task for neurophysiology and theoretical medicine. First of all, one should devote
attention to the study of cortico-subcorticsl correlations, investigation of the
nervous substrate of emotional excitation of a negative nature.

The Nervous Substrate of Emotions

The aggregate of brain structures involved nxformation of negative emotional stress
includes, in addition to the hypothalamus, reticular formation of the stem, struc-
tures of the limbic system, various regions of the cerebral cortex.

The so-called emotional ring of Paper [1511 refers to a number of structures of the
limbic system: hippocampus. fornix, mammillary body, anterior thalamic nuclei and
cingulate gyrus. The cingulate gyrus is viewed as the receptive area of emotions
arising as a result of impulses from the hypothalamus. The hypothesis of Paper

of continuous circulation of excitation within the limbic structures serves as a
solid foundation for current conceptions of the mechanism of emotions; however,
this scheme is not without flaws. Papez did not explain how emotional excitation
is formed, what the role of the neocortex is in this mechanism, since without it
there cannot be a conscious emotional sensation.

There is complex systemic organization of the mechanism of emotional excitation and
its structural bases. Although formation of emotions is related to specific struc-
tures [20, 21], they are the result of activity of an integrated dynamic system
that involves, if not the entire brain, at least different levels thereof.

Experiments of recent years have demonstrated convincingly how important the
role of functional state of neocortical regions is in formation of a specific
emotional set in animals. The studies of N. Yu. Balenkov [20] demonstrated that

9b

functional exclusion of the anterior segments of the cerebral cortex, including
sensorimotor zones, increases general emotional tonus. Consequently , the emotional
state of an organism is determined by the neocortex, which guides and forms the '
effector elements of emotions, making it possible for them to be of an adaptive
significance. The temporal region of the cerebral cortex, which is directly in-
volved in processes of afferent synthesis, fixation and reproduction of an animal's

prior experience, plays a special role in forming the specifics of guided emotional
states.

As we know, emotional stress states can be induced experimentally, for example, by
the uncertainty of a situation when conditioned stimuli are associated, with some
degree of probability, with delivery of electric current. In such an aperimental

situation, animals presented profound autonomic and endocrine changes associated
with extremely marked behavioral reactions.

It should be noted that with all the seeming completeness of aggressive-defense
reactions, they are quite different in decorticated and intact animals. The main
point is that these reactions lose their adaptive meaning, direction, biological

benefit in decorticated animals, and they arise readily in response to inadequate
stimuli.

A. 1. Shumilina [112] established that afferent synthesis of afferentations differ-
ing in meaning breaks down in lobectomied animals, with impaired evaluation of
conformity of parameters of real results of action to the model formed as an
"acceptor of action." These and other facts [113, 11‘] confirmed the conception of
P. K. Anokhin concerning the predominant link between afferent synthesis and the

"action acceptor" system and functions of the anterior regions of the cerebral
cortex.

Differentiation of functions of the nonspecific subcortical system is achieved
largely as a result of inhibitory and alleviating corticofugal influences.

In addition, it is known that removal of the entire neocortex from cats, with pre-
servation of limbic structures, rendered the animals overtly apathetic and emo-
tionally areactive [124]. However, it is remarkable that, as a result of such an
operation, in response to exogenous stimuli the animals did not present the
"false rage" reaction. All this led the authors to assume that not only the
cerebral cortex but the limbic paleocortex have a restraining influence on the
lower centers of the stem that determine aggressive reactions.

Some authors [128, 123] attribute the leading role in appearance of negative emo-
tions to thalamic structures, stimulation of which in birds [23] leads to specific
emotional movements. Destruction of the cerebral cortex does not eliminate this
phenomenon.

Stimulation of the medial thalamic nucleus of man elicits the emotion of anger
[133]. which attenuates when the dorsomedial thalamus is destroyed. However, there
are also other data on this score. Thus, emotions of rear and rage elicited by
electric stimulation of several thalamic nuclei are inhibited by stimlation of
the centromedial thalamic nucleus. In this case, the aftereffect of these reac-
tions is briefer. Some authors [62] observed an attack reaction in animals as a
result of stimulating their medial thalamic nuclei. Destruction of the dorso-

medial nuclei intensified the rage reaction of cats. Thus, thalamic structures .
may have both an inhibitory and activating effect on reactions of a negative nature.

Some authors [126] established that emotional reactions are observed in cats even
after resection of part of the olfactory brain, particularly the amygdala and medial
cortex. At the same time, it was demonstrated that resection of only the cerebral
cortex leads, on the contrary, to development of submissiveness in the animals.

Destruction of the amygdaloid nucleus in cats elicited the "false rage" reaction,
whereas bilateral destruction of the structure of Papez' "emotional ring"-the tem-
poral lobes, paleocortex, including the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, ventral hippo-
campus, as well as thalamic nuclei-1ed monkeys to an unusually calm state [137,
143]. According to other data, with simultaneous stimulation of the hypothalamus
and amygdaloid region, the amygdaloid nucleus sometimes inhibited the attack
reaction induced by stimulation of the hypothalamus [28, 53]. Interestingly enough,
build up of fear and agression, as well as attenuation of these reactions after
removal of the amygdala, were observed by the same authors [108].

Disappearance of aggressive reactions of animals after resection of the amygdala and,
on the contrary, appearance thereof warrant the belief that the amygdaloid nucleus

has both an alleviating and inhibitory effect on lower mechanisms of aggressive
behavior [124].

Thus, removal of the amygdala has different effects on manifestation of defense
reactions. Perhaps this is related to extensive damage to this region, as well

as distinctions of other structures of the central nervous system, with which the
amygdala is closely linked.

It is known that the calm state caused by removal of the amygdala is followed by
heightened rage after additional damage to the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei.

When limited parts of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus are destroyed or re-

moved, tame animals change to wild ones with vivid aggressive reactions that can be
readily induced by even insignificant stimuli.

According to the hypothalamic theory of origin of emotions, the "central motivated
state is maintained by stimulation of special hypothalamic centers which are in-

fluenced by the cerebral cortex, inhibitory hypothalamic centers and various humoral
factors"[158].

The violent rage reaction to mild stimuli is manifested by animals both after re-
section of the cerebral cortex and destruction of the amygdala, ventromedial hypo-
thalamic nuclei and even some thalamic nuclei.

Thus, these data are indicative of the existence of certain mechanisms that inhibit

emotional reactions not only on the level of the cortex, but limbic structures of
the brain.

As far back as the start of the 20th century, Sherrington [156] demonstrated that
brief attack reactions, strictly related to stimuli, are observed in decerebrated
animals. Manifestations of "false rage" persisted in animals after resection of

all structures situated lateral, rostral and dorsal to the posterior hypothalamus
and disappeared only after removal of this part of the brain [123]. Strong, overtly

nociceptivestimuliare needed to elicit emotional reactions in decerebrated animals,
whereas weaker, tactile ones are needed for decorticated animals.

0n the basis of the experimental data, many researchers have concluded that the
hypothalamus plays the initiating role in onset and formation of emotions and
motivational states [94, 134, 97, 115].

In the 1960's, there was broad recognition of an analogous theory of Gellhorn [34]
in which onset of emotions is also related to the hypothalamic system, with its
rich bilateral connections to many structures of the central nervous system. In
the presence of negative emotional states there is disruption of hypochalamic equi-
librium, particularly between the anterior and posterior hypothalamus. In turn,
these changes alter the intensity of hypothalamocortical correlations and are
instrumental in formation of negative emotional and behavioral reactions. Gellhorn
indicates that the limbic system plays the role of a sort of mediator between the

hypothalamus and cerebral cortex, determining the quality of emotional sensations
on the level of the cerebral cortex.

According to clinical data, the most marked mental disorders are observed when there
are lesions to the posterior hypothalamus.

More recent studies revealed that the entire set of reactions characterized in
intact animals by an affective state of fear and anger can be induced in mesence-
phalic animals. The reticular formation of the brain stem is particularly involved

in expression of these reactions, which are the main signs of an emotional state
[14, 19, 195].

According to the so-called activation theory of Lindsley [165], the leading role
in onset of emotional states is attributed to the reticulohypothalamic system. ex-
citability of which increases markedly with formation of emotions. This author
discOVered, in a study of EEG changes, that there was a decrease in activity of
cortical regions and onset of "functional" decortication as a result of excessive
stimulation of expressly that system.

As we know, the reticular formation of the brain has numerous anatomical and func-
tional connections with various parts of the hypothalamus, thalamus, amygdala. as
well as elements of the limbic system. Evidently, such broad relations of the
reticular formation to other brain structures and, in particular, the cortex,

upon which it has "specific" activating influences, determine its participation

in forming emotional states.

Thus, extensive, functionally united parts of the brain are involved in forming
emotional states: the hypothalamus, reticular formation, various limbic structures,
as well as the cerebral cortex.

In addition, many researchers [133, 137, 98, 61] have indicated that there is
functional dissimilarity of different structures involved in forming emotional
tension of a negative nature. Analysis of these data requires that we dwell in
somewhat greater detail on the complex diencephalomesencephalic part of the brain,
hypotha1an1ccentersand their correlations with other structures of the brain.

In the course of formation of integral behavioral reactions associated with emotional
excitation, the hypothalamic "centers" interact with numerous other structures,

97
INJR10FF1(JAI.IISE‘OIHUY
INNR OFTWCJA1.USIIONLN

forming certain functional systems, among which hypothalamo-cortical relations
occupy a central place [46].

Removal of the cerebral cortex deprives emotional and behavioral reactions of
their purposefulness.

The posterior hypothalamus has the most marked activating effect on the cerebral
cortex, although there is also information aboutthe cordcopetal influences of
its rostral parts [100, 150].

As for the anterior and lateral regions of the hypothalamus, they have an inhibi-
tory effect on the cortex as a result of the depressing effect on structures of
the activating reticular formation [132]. Thus, in general the hypothalamus has a
tonic effect on the cortex: it stimulates, inhibits, regulates the level of brain
activity and autonomic functions of the organism. Excitation arising in the hypo-
thalamus determines the nature of the biological quality of various activations

ascending to the cortex, lending a specific flavor to behavioral reactions and
their emotional coloration.

The ascending influence of the hypothalamus on the cortex is formed in close func-
tional interaction with the reticular formation, thalamus, amygdala and others.
Many authors stress the functional unity of this complex [165, 150, 151].

By virtue of existence of the reticulo-cortical, as well as hypothalamo-reticular
systems, the functional influence of the hypothalamus on the cerebral cortex is
often implemented with the participation of the reticular formation.

0n the basis of experimental data, K. V. Sudakov [97] established that it is
expressly on the limbico-hypothalamo-re:icular level, as a result of prolonged
negative emotional states, that "static excitation" develops, which is the
constant source of descending pressor influences on peripheral organs.

The reticular formation of the brain stem is important in this respect. Simul-
taneous stimulation of the reticular formation and posterior hypothalamus prolongs
significantly EEG activation of cortieo-subcortical structures and peripheral
reactions. Anodal blocking of the region of the reticular formation of the mesen-
cephalon, on the contrary, attenuates significantly the hypothalamic hypertensive
reaction.

Thus, the main rautes of dissemination of hypothalamic influences on the cerebral
cortex may be either direct or through adjacent subcortical elements (thalamus,
reticular formation, amygdala, etc.).

The existence of such diverse relations of the hypothalamus creates vast opportuni-
ties for its participation in forming the most complex reactions of the organism,

including emotional stress that requires integration of virtually all of the main
levels of the brain, including the neocortex.

Electroencephalographi:Parameters of Emotional Reactions

One of the most widespread methods of studying electrical activity of the cortex
and subcortical structures of the brain is electroencephalography [8, 89, 95].

Numerous studies ll, 19. 64] pursued in the laboratory of P. K. Anokhin revealed
that synchronized electrical oscillations at a frequency of 6-7 Hz, or so-called
theta waves (Figure 2), arise in various cortical and subcortical structures of the
brain in biologically adverse or "conflict" situations associated with negative
emotional states. Participation of the adrenergic substrate of the reticular for-
mation and hypothalamus in generating an orderly rhythm of 4-7 Hz (Figure 2) en-
abled P. K. Anokhin and A. I. Shumilina to consider this the "tension rhythm" or

"stress rhythm," i.e., the electrographic expression of biologically negative
emotional reactions.

During development of a conditioned defense reaction to a bell combined with elec-
trocutaneous stimulus, electrical activity at a frequency of 4-7 Hz was recorded
in the reticular formation of the mesencephalon. thalamus, hippocampus, hypothala-

mus, as well as temporal and occipital regions of the neocortex, i.e., there was
the same EEG change as with a nociceptive stimulus [111, 115].

Clinical observations of slow regular oscillations of electric potentials also
confirmed the fact that an orderly rhythm of 4-7 a: appears most often in the
presence of negative emotional states-fear, pain. dissatisfaction {1621.

Broad generalization over various subcortical and cortical structures of the brain
is a typical distinction of tension rhythm.

99
FIH!()FF1(1AI.I£5E§(NVLY
FORlOFFKﬂAl.USE(MVLY

However, the expression of this rhythm is not the same in different structures of
the brain. In the cortex, particularly the sensorimotor region, the 4-7 B: rhythm
is considerably lower in amplitude than in nonspecific subcortical structures. It
has been established that EEG activity of the senaorimotor region is usually mani-
fasted in the form of a desynchronization reaction during formation of a negative
emotional state of the organism; at this time, a distinct tension rhythm of 6-7 H:
is recorded from subcortical nonspecific structures [19]. with this, one observes
changes in different directions in energy of the frequency spectrum of electrical
activity of the cortex and some Iimbic structures [85, 66, 31].

In the neocortex, particularly its anterior regions, the energy of theta waves
becomes lower than in subcortical structures where, on the contrary, it increases
significantly.

Many nonspecific structures of the brain are involved in onset of tension rhythm.
Destruction of various nuclei of the thalamus, hypothalamus and mesencephalon
elicits disappearance of tension rhythm in all brain leads [141].

After bilateral electrolytic destruction of the posteromedial hypothalamus of
mentally ill patients with marked aggressive behavior, the tension rhythm on the
EEC changed to slow, high-amplitude irregular oscillations. Aggressive behavior
disappeared and sleepiness appeared. The effects of such destruction persisted for
3 years.

Several authors [152] have called attention to the possible role of the anatomical
system of the Naut [2] bond in appearance of theta rhythm. It is expressly the
closed system over which there is continuous circulation of excitation that de-
termines tonic activation of the cerebral cortex [10].

With repeated electrodermal stimulation, the intensity of EEG theta rhythm associ-
ated with autonomic changes depends largely on the stage of formation of emotional
stress. Thus, at the first stage (1-1.5 h) this rhythm becomes dominant, whereas

several hours later its amplitude increases significantly in the hypothalamus and

reticular formation [97].

With continuous stimulation of negative emotiogenic centers of the hypothalamus

for many hours, during the first hour a tension rhythm (6-7 Hz) is recorded in

the reticular formation, amygdala, septum and hippocampus, which is associated with
elevation of arterial pressure and change in other autonomic parameters. In the
next 2-3 h of stimulation, these changes persisted. After normalization of somatic
and autonomic parameters there was a corresponding change in EEG activity.

In the presence of negative emotional states, appearance of theta rhythm is governed
by the law of probable reaction of the organism or information law of P. V. Simonov.
This EEG parameter increases significantly in an uncertain experimental situation.
In the course of developing a conditioned defense reaction, there is an increase

in percentage of theta waves in the spectrum of the hippocampal BEG, which is
associated with acceleration of heart rate. These changes are the most significant
and stable under conditions of "pragmatic uncertainty" [86, 89].

A study of electrophysiologicai parameters of animals in situations differing in
probability of "anticipation" of emotionally unpleasant stimuli confirmed the
above-mentioned results (i). In these experiments, regularly timed electrodermal

100
FOR‘OFFKJAI.USE(MVLY
FOR OFFKJAl.lEﬂi(NVLY

stimuli preceded by a flash of light were used, as well as random stimuli without
the flash. For the first 3 h of the experiment, virtually the same stress states
were observed in both situations. There was dominance mainly of tension rhythm on
the EEC of the cortex and hypothalamus. The heart rate increased significantly.
Motor reactions were the same, vocal ones appeared at the moment of electrodermal
stimulation. After stimulation for 3 h there was a change in condition of animals
in different groups. Thus, the heart rate and motor reactions diminished in the
signal situation. Movements were made only in response to the stressor. In the
intervals between signals the tension rhythm was replaced by high-amplitude but
lower frequency oscillations. Tension rhythm was recorded on the EEG only during
use of the stressor. In the "signal-free" situation, the changes in all parameters
studied were persistent and more significant. At the same time, there were addi-
tional vocal reaction in periods between signals. The amplitude of tension rhythm
increased by 1.5 times. In other words, in the case of "anticipation" of emotionally
unpleasant stimuli there was less development of a stress state.

Impaired emotional activity elicits, first of all, disorders referable to cerebral
processes characterizing the primary changes that arise at the very earliest stages
of development of stress [95].

Changes in some parameters of cerebral homeostasis [33] make it possible to assess
the functional changes in the central nervous system that are associated with
corresponding changes in mental activity as well. The following 825 parameters were
used to assess disturbances of cerebral homeostasis: overall change in EEG activity
of the brain, stability of periods of alpha waves, etc. Impairment of cerebral
homeostasis is manifested by drastic elevation, decline or fluctuation of level

of excitability and lability of the central nervous system, inadequate replacement
of one type of reaction with another, appearance of dissociation between components
of the same reaction [40].

Many authors have observed a wide diversity of electrographic changes during
formation of various emotional states in animals and man.

According to the data of some authors [145], depression of alpha waves and marked

beta activity are typical of emotional tension in patients with neurosis and
signs of emotional instability.

In addition. appearance of theta waves was noted with the use of tactile stimuli
that are pleasant to animals. In the rabbit EEG, such activity was also recorded
during self-stimulation, whereas stimulation of points that elicit a negative
reaction was associated with desynchronization.

After creating chronic nociceptive foci in rabbits, some authors observed high-
amplitude (up to 500 nV) and irregular slow (2-4 cycles/s) waves in electrical
activity of the sensorimotor cortex, thalamus and reticular formation.

According to the data of N. P. Bekhtereva and V. M. Smirnov [25], the dynamics of
slow EEG processes, in particular, changes in minute level of the constant potential
in different parts of the brain, constitute a precise correlate of an emotional
mental state.

The foregoing indicates that it is necessary to use more precise and objective
methods of quantitative analysis for the study of the existing problem.

101
FORiOFFﬂJA1.USE(NVLY
FOIIOFTNCIAI.USE!MVLY

This need is attributable to a significant extent to the fact that most authors
assessed visually the EEC changes, which are quite complex and random. The need
for strict mathematical analysis increases even more when studying the dynamics
as related to exposure of the organism to numerous [or repeated) factors.

Mathematical Correlates

In the very earliest works of physiologists who studied complex electrical phenomena
of the brain it became necessary to make an objective mathematical evaluation of

its bioelectric potentials. The work of M. N. Livanov [S9, 60] was a particular
landmark in this direction.

At the present time, many researchers are using with success methods of quantitative

processing of EEG's to study the functional state of the organism [49, 32, 63, 65,
74, 75, 117, lOlb].

In the opinion of A. A. Genkin [36]: "Analysis of an BEG process could become con-
siderably more effective if we were able to replace observation of the virtually
boundless dynamics of a complex overall process with consideration of the dynamics

of different parameters that would contain all or virtually all information about
the general process."

For example, there is very precise correlation between a change in one of the para-
meters of electric potentials of the brain, phase asymmetry, ascending and descend-
ing fronts of EEG waves, and certain functional states of the body.

Reduction of phase asymmetry with repetition of "indifferent" stimuli in man was
correlated in the same direction with the dynamics of autonomic parameters.

Changes in functional state of the brain and excitability of cortical neurons that
affect the rate of formation of responses are closely correlated with changes in
level of phase asymmetry: in the presence of mental tension this parameter rises
and with fatigue it declines, and this is repeated in many experiments. One can
assess the specifics of an activity--mental arithmetic, visual pictures, making

a fist—-fron the nature of these changes [106, 35].

It should be noted that maximum changes in asymmetry of alpha wave phases in the
frontal cortex occur upon stimulation of the thalamus, reticular formation and
various afferent stimuli.

During the period of preparing for a voluntary movement, in the interval between
warning and triggering signals, an "anticipation wave" is demonstrable in the
anterior parts of the brain, manifested by an increase in positive shift of mean
phase asymmetry of EEG waves. After a completed action and during repetition
thereof this parameter declines.

The changes in this parameter become more static and stable in the presence of
various brain lesions and psychopathological states [106].

A change in another time parameter of phase changes is also of some interest.

Analysis [84] of evoked potentials in the motor and occipital parts of the brain
revealed that the phase shift observed between them occurs with the first pre-
sentationsof light and disappears with repetition thereof. The phase shift

102

F(HI(NHWCJAI.USII(HVLY

increases again before appearance of conditioned reflex motor responses. It was
found that the largest number of motor responses occurs in a specific phase of an
evoked potential, when the phase shift reaches a maximum and comes close to its
half cycle [period]. Consequently, there are phases of EEG potentials, in which
there is alleviation of the motor response and phases of so-called relative motor
rest.

Of special interest are sign-related phase shifts referable to slow BEG waves in the
cortex related to emotional reactions. There is negativization of see of these
waves with positive emotions and Foaltivization with negative ones .

Cross-correlation analysis revealed [43] that there is an increase in phase shift

in the range of 5-7 oscillations/s between electric potentials of the motor and
visual cortex in response to a conditioned defense stimulus. These changes were
associated with an increase in cross-correlation coefficients and periodicity of
theta rhythm. It cannot be ruled out, as believed by some authors, that the opti-
mus conditions for dissemination of excitation among various regions corresponds to
a phase shift other than nil. The authors made indirect evaluation of the magni- '
tude of the phase shift (from the cross-spectrum), on the basis of the angle whose
tangent equals the ratio of sine-transformation to cosine-~transformation of cross-
correlation function.

of considerable interest is the study made by O. H. Grindel‘ of auto- and cross-
correlation functions of the frequency spectrum of the BBB of the human cerebral
cortex [38]. This author reports that the EEG waves in different ranges of rhythms
are distinctly synphasic for symmetrical points of the occipital and frontal
cortex. The coefficients of cross-correlation of electric potentials were higher
in symmetrical leads than in frontal and occipital leads. Two forms of correla-
tions were demonstrated in frontal-occipital leads: 1) cross-correlograms with pre-
valence of nonperiodic components and without phase shifts. indicative of the random
nature of connection ("impulse connection") showing that there was simultaneous
input of impulses from the subcortical region to both tested points of the cortex;
2) cross-correlograms of a periodic nature with phase shifts indicative of develop-
ment of periodic processes in the two cortical points analyzed. The phase shifts
were indicative of the order of dissemination of the process from one cortical
point to the other.

The phase relations between the occipital and central regions of the human cortex
depend on the nature of the EEG [38). In the presence of alpha waves, the occipital
cortex is ahead in phase and in the absence of these waves it is the central region.
The phase correlations change under the influence of a photic stimulus, regardless
of the nature of the BBC: the central cortex becomes the leading element, being
associated with an increase in phase shifts (to 100 ms or more) and regularization
of the EEG process [38]. In the opinion of the cited author, subcortical struc-
tures could be the initiating points that influence the cortex.

It was demonstrated with the use of a toposcope [152] that there is a 180’ phase
shift in synchronized theta rhythm between the cortex and diencephalic struc-
tures, whereas no such signs are noted between the hippocampus and diencephalon.
EEG rhythms "shifted" at the rate of about 340 mm/s between different parts of the
brain.

Cross-correlation analysis of phase shift of EEG rhythm (4-7 Hz) between the cortex
and entorhlnal ["entorial"?] region revealed [118] that, at the early stage of

103
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR‘OFFﬂﬂAl.USE(NVLY

development of the conditioned response, the phase of subcortical theta rhythm was
ahead of the cortical rhythms , whereas when the reaction was consolidated it
was the entorial region, on the contrary, that was ahead (by 30-65 ms).

In the opinion of P. K. Anokhin, phase correlations, which are among the main para-
meters of reverberation processes, can serve as an indicator of activation of
projection zones of the cortex and subcortical emotiogenic structures during for—
nation of emotional stress states. It should be noted that, according to a number
of authors, various shifts of EEG wave phases modulate the level of excitability

of brain structures involved in regulating the wakefulness level, memory processes
and emotional reactions. For this reason, nonspecific [3, 26, 106] subcortical
structures (hypothalamus, reticular formation) play the leading role in the genesis
of slowly changing phase correlations associated with various metabolic changes.

TMquumnuuuasmhthcMmuinmuewﬁuofﬂowmmuhan

related to "genuine" neurophysiological processes, upon which brain function is
based.

The genesis of slow oscillations of phase correlations of EEG potentials, as well
as changes in EEG waves themselves, are based on changes in synaptic and dendritic
potentials [3, 106], since excitability of nerve tissue and metabolic tonus are
determined not only by excitatory impulses traveling to neurons, but biologically
active substances circulating in blood.

Some authors attribute the stability of changes in phase correlations of EEG poten-
tials in different brain structures to changes in sensitivity of apical dendrites
and postsynaptic slow potentials, as well as persistent biochemical changes in
neurons [117, 126, 125]. Also, with regard to changes in phase shifts, importance
is attributed to changes in neuronal cytoplasm, which occur under the influence of
prolonged changes related to membrane polarization [159]. The increase in asymmetry
of phases of the EEG process is interpreted as an indicator of prevalence of one

type of polarization over others. These data are indicative of the electrotonic
nature of phase correlations [35, 36].

Another statistical parsmeter-coefficient of cross-correlation--acquired broad
use in studies of EEG potentials of the brain. The basic research conducted in the
laboratory of H. N. Livanov revealed that there is more "alleviated" passage of
excitation from the afferent system to the effector one with maximum values of the
cross-correlation coefficient (Pax) than with low values. This thesis was demon-
strated in a particularly distinct way in the works of V. D. Trush et al. [101],
who compared excitability of the sensorimotor cortex with and without maximum
correlation between cortical potentials. Bxcitability of the brain was determined
according to the animal's motor reaction to cortical stimulation with threshold
levels of electric current. The results revealed that, in the presence of maximum
correlation of cortical potentials, mild direct stimulation of the sensorimotor
cortex reached threshold values more often than without this maximum correlation.

The authors obtained analogous results in another way: they considered the ratio

of dispersion of the electromyogram before and during stimulation. It was found
that the mean magnitude of the reaction to stimuli delivered against the background
of P>Pax constituted 4.7, and with P<Pax - l.9. Thus, in the presence of maximum
correlation between potentials of the motor and visual cortex, the mean magnitude
of the reaction (excitability) was considerably greater and the threshold of stimu-
lation of the cortical region was lower than in the absence thereof.

It should be noted that the fate of excitation spreading among cortical points
may vary, depending not only on the values of the cross-correlation coefficients,
dispersion of the EEG process, but phasic correlations between 336 waves (H. N.
Livanov). This must be given a closer scrutiny. However, the mechanism causing

"alleviated conduction" of excitation cannot be reduced to a change in excitability
of only cortical regions.

Indeed. in 1967, I. N. Knipst demonstrated that, during development of the conditioned
defense reaction, there was increase in synchronization of EEG potentials both in the
cortex and subcortical Structures (thalamus, hypothalamus, reticular formation of

the mesencephalon). Depending on the stage of development of the conditioned defense
reaction, he observed selective increase in synchronization of electric potentials

of cortical representation of stimuli used and some subcortical structures. These
changes were also associated with increased coherence in the theta rhythm range
between cortical regions. After consolidation of the conditioned reflex, in the
period between signals, both parameters again diminished. In contrast, the changes
related to the direct effect of the conditioned signal were more persistent; however,
when the reaction became extinct these changes reverted to the initial level.

It is believed by the authors that these changes reflect trace processes related
to learning.

It is known that there is a drastic increase in number of highly correlated sections
[60] in the cerebral cortex, particularly its anterior regions, during performance
of mental work (problem solving). These properties of synchronization of electric
potentials of cortical theta rhythms can be defined as processes that occur both

in the cortex proper and subcortical structures. This was indicated by the de-
cline of cross-correlation coefficients, which was demonstrated when the cortex was
isolated from subcortical elements, during extinction of the conditioned defense
reaction and after administration of pharmacological agents that block subcortical
structures (sodium amytal, aminazin and others). Conversely, with electric stimula-
tion of the posterior hypothalamus and reticular formation these parameters grew.

H. N. Livanov relates these changes also to an additional 180‘ phase shift, which
occurred as a result of prolonged "transfers" of EEG activity between the anterior
and posterior cortical regions.

Thus, in the light of the data we have submitted, more comprehensive investigation
of cortical-subcortical cross-correlations obtained from comparing electrical po-
tentials of cortical regions directly to electrical potentials of subcortical
structures acquires special importance.

1. N. Knipst demonstrated quite convincingly that, during development of the con-
ditioned defense reflex, most leads with a high percentage of similarity of bio-
electricsl oscillations were referable to the cerebral cortex, somewhat fewer to
subcortical structures (different parts of the diencephalon, reticular formation)
and very few to cortical-subcortical :arameters. These levels changed under the
influence of stimuli, but the correlations between them remained the same.

It should be noted that concurrent investigation of phase correlations in these
brain structures could perhaps disclose the reason why authors found different
values for the cross-correlation coefficients.

Much attention is also being given to analysis of coherence and dispersion [44, 43,
60, 101] to obtain a fuller idea about EEG processes. A coherence of close to l
with a phase angle between two EEG processes in the cortex close to zero at a given
frequency corresponds to a high positive correlation. Stabilization of the phase
angle also affects this parameter. Special mathematical analysis revealed some
correlation between changes in spatial synchronization of the EEG process. intensity
or dispersion of a 4-7 Hz rhythm and their coherence. In particular, an absolutely
objective pattern was discovered: low levels of spatial synchronization correspond

to diminished coherence of the EEG processes analyzed or, as the authors explain it,
presence of phase shifts between them.

Typical changes in spatial synchronization of EEG potentials within the cerebral
cortex, which were demonstrated in the presence of certain pathological states of
man, merit attention. Spatial synchronization was significantly greater in
patients suffering from neurosis. schizophrenia and epilepsy, as compared to the
norm. In the presence of neurotic states, the highly correlated segments were

in the anterior and frontal regions, whereas in the presence of schizophrenia and
epilepsy they were more often localized in the parietal and occipital regions.[60].

It is important to mention that, in the presence of neurotic states, changes in
spatial synchronization occurred readily, not only due to conflicting words, but
"indifferent" ones. But the main thing is that for a long period of time the

same segments of the cortex consistently showed the same coefficients of correla-
tion in neurotic patients, unlike schizophrenics and epileptics, which was indica-
tive of persistence and stability of the correlations studied. The latter is parti-
cularly important if we consider that I. P. Pavlov considered that neurosis was
based on signs of pathological stasis ["inertia"] and stability of impaired nervous

processes. Thus, stabilization of expressly cross-correlations could be one of the
indicators of formation of neurotic states.

Conversely, in the presence of schizophrenia and epilepsy, the cross-correlation
coefficients are extremely unstable, not only in comparison to neurotic states,
but the norm.

The authors arrive at the conclusion that, in addition to a cortical mechanism,
subcortical structures are important to development of various pathological pro-
cesses in the central nervous system, particularly the reticular formation and
hypothalamus. the direct study of which in correlation with the cerebral cortex
would enrich our knowledge about central mechanisms of formation of the static
form of negative emotional excitation.

It should be noted that studies of the human cerebral cortex [38] in the presence
of tumors of various cortical and subcortical structures revealed that they were
associated with typical changes in cross-correlation parameters of the EEG. It
was found that, in such cases, stable pathological "cyclic" correlations, with
half-period phase shifts, appeared in the frontal and occipital regions. The
change in direction of phase shifts, increase or decrease of cross-correlation
coefficients and periodic components depended on the initial levels of these para-
meters and localization of the tumor. The most marked and persistent changes were
noted with lesions to the anterior-frontal and diencephalic parts of the brain.

In addition to EEC studies, cross-correlation analysis is used with success in
electromyography, as well as studies of electrical activity of sympathetic nerves
of the heart, kidneys, etc.

Chapter 2. Cortico-Subcorticsl Cross Correlation During Formation of Emotional
Stress States

Some Distinctions of Cortico-Subcortical Cross Correlations

0n the basis of conceptions [12, 96] of a "pacemaker" mechanism of formation of the
main biological emotions and motivations, it was necessary, first of all, to deter-
mine whether distinctions of the pacemaker type of interaction between the analyzed
brain structures affect the values of statistical parameters of electrical potentials
of the brain.

With this in mind, studies were made of the correlation between slow BEG waves of
cortical (sensorimotor, temporal and occipital cortex) and subcortical structures
(posterior and ventromedial parts of the hypothalamus, reticular formation, amygdala,
medial thalamic nucleus) with all sorts of variants of cross-correlation between
them during and after delivery of elactrodermal stimuli. The results of analysis

of cross-correlograms revealed (Figure 3) that, in the vast majority of cases, slow
waves of all analyzed structures were synphasic or, on the average, presented minor
phase shifts (2.5-16 ms) before delivery of electrodermal stimuli. Only in the
reticular formation did the changes sometimes reach 16-25 s. The strongest functional
relations (up to 0.76) were noted between electrical activity of projection zones of
the cortex (2) and their symmetrical parts (right and left hemispheres). They

were somewhat lower (to 0.65) between subcortical (3) structures (thalamus, amygdala,
ventromedial hypothalamus), and only mild functional links were noted between
cortico-subcortical (4, 5) elements. However, the functional relationship was the
most significant (0.75-0.8) between the reticular formation and posterior hypo-
thalamus (1).

Cross-correlation analysis of slow EEG waves after electrocutaneous stimulation
revealed an interesting pattern. The most significant phase shifts (up to the

half period) appeared when we compared the slow BEG waves of the analyzed struc-
tures to slow waves of the posterior hypothalamus or reticular formation (5). These
changes were indicative of phasic advance of slow EEG waves of the posterior hypo-
thalamus and reticular formation in relation to slow waves of all analyzed brain

structures, between which there were either insignificant phase shifts (2.5-16 ms)
or none at all (Figure 3).

As for the functional relations, they were more accentuated after electrodermal

stimulation; however, the ratio between different structures remained the same as
in the background, before stimulation.

As can be seen in Figure 3, maximum increase of this parameter was observed among

intercortical regions (2), and among the subcortical ones between the posterior
hypothalamus and reticular formation (1).

As compared to these changes, the increase in functional relations of cortical
regions to subcortical structures, particularly the posterior hypothalamus and
reticular formation, was insignificant.

Maximum dispersion of EEG tension rhythm was observed in the posterior hypothalamus
and reticular formation, somewhat less in other subcortical structures and least
of all in the cortical regions of the hemispheres. Hence, maximum functional
relations are demonstrable between electric potentials of structures, between which
there are minimal phase shifts, associated with some difference in dispersion of
electric potentials in each of the compared brain structures. With a greater
difference in dispersion (Figure 3) and large phase shifts (to the half period) in
electric potentials of compared brain structures, the functional relations most
often are minimal. In other words, changes in maximum of the cross-correlation
function in either direction are related to corresponding changes in phase

shifts and dispersion of EEG tension rhythm.

Thus, the demonstrated distinctions of changes in cross-correlations between
cortical and subcortical structures during defense reactions enable us to dis-
cuss the existence of "special" correlations of the posterior hypothalamus and
reticular formations with various structures of the brain.

In addition, it is known that the hypothalamus, reticular formation of the brain
stem, limbic structures, as well as the cerebral cortex, are directly involved in
the physiological mechanisms of formation of an emotional state. However, ex-
pressly the hypothalamus has the exceptionally important capacity of transforming
nervous influences into humoral ones and vice versa in the complex correlations
between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures. As a result, conditions
are created for changing the needs of the organism into the appropriate and
specific forms of behavior [94]. For this reason, when studying the dynamics of
formation of emotional stress states, it is particularly important to detect the
changes that occur in correlations between the hypothalamus and reticular forma-

tion, various elements of the limbic system, as well as projection zones of the
cerebral cortex.

The program of correlation analysis of each experiment consisted of processing lO—s
EEG segments, first in the background before use of stimuli. Then, similar lO-s
BEG segments were studied in all experimental situations, during formation of

emotional stress, just prior to use of stimuli, during delivery thereof and at
different intervals between them: in the first half of the period closer to the
end of electrodermal stimulation and in the second half, before it.

A state that develops in immobilized animals with the repeated use of stereotype
or randomly timed electrodermal stimuli, which evoked drastic accentuation of
inspiratory tonus of the respiratory center, twitching of the stimulated limb,
occasionally vocal, as well as general motor reaction with attempts to get free,
was used as a model of emotional stress. The emotional state that appeared under
the influence of nociceptive stimuli is referable to the most primitive, "basic"
(1. P. Pavlov) emotions of the defense type. Being one of the strongest ones, it
elicits changes in all systems of the organism related to defense and adaptive
reactions. It was borne in mind that, with the same physical parameters of stimuli,
the degree of emotional tension depends on such purely information-related factors
as stereotypy, randomness and signal value of the stimulus, i.e., those that

mainly determine differences in possibility of "anticipating" emotionally unpleasant
stimuli.

The 4-7 Hz (Figure 2) £26 rhythm that appears with negative emotional tension in-
volves virtually all structures of the brain and, for this reason, is a good electro-
graphic model for studying stressor states and their central neurophysiological
mechanisms.

Correlation Parameters of EEG Potentials of Different Structures of the
Brain in a "Signal-Free" Situation-~"aandomness Factor"

According to biological theory of emotions [34],.negative emotional tension occurs
when feedback messages from the results of a performed action do not coincide

with the previously prepared model of future events, the acceptor of action results.
When there is prolonged imbalance, negative emotional tension increases and changes
to a stationary form. For this reason, in the present series we selected the method
of delivery of numerous irregularly timed (30 s to 3 min) electrocutaneous stimuli
to the hind leg of an immobilized rabbit. Voltage was increased as the animals
adapted to the nociceptive stimulus, starting at 10-20 V.

The conflict situation, in which immobilized rabbits received a painful shock [blow]
and could not eliminate pain. was aggravated in this series by the fact that the
animals were submitted to irregularly timed electrodermal stimuli, i.e., an
uncertain situation, a so-called "signal-free" situation. Under the conditions of
this experiment, this had the animals experiencing a constant negative emotional
stress state, since with irregularly timed nociceptive stimuli there was a low
probability (or utter impossibility) of their anticipating the time of delivery

of emotionally unpleasant stimuli, and there was a severe shortage of "pragmatic
information." Such information-related characteristics of the stress situation,
which created difficult conditions, intensified negative emotional tension.

The data obtained on the first group of rabbits revealed that, before electrodermal
stimulation, the slow oscillations of EEG potentials (Figure 2) of the sensorimotor,
temporal and occipital cortex were essentially synphasic or presented minor (2.5-
16 ms) phase shifts in relation to the posterior hypothalamus (Figure 4). The
posterior hypothalamus was the advancing structure with regard to tension rhythm.

It should he noted that the hypothalamic and cortical changes were the most signi-
ficant in rabbits that presented synphasic relations between the hypothalamus and
reticular formation even in the background, prior to electrodermal stimulation.

At the same time, there was a decrease in phasic changes of tension rhythm of the
reticular formation and posterior hypothalamus in response to electrodermal

110

stimuli, which was associated with an increase in maximum of cross-correlation func-
tions. when there were no phase shifts, the hypothalamo-reticular correlations
remained synphasic even during electrodermal stimulation.

Repeated delivery of stimuli led to the following changes in the parameters we
analyzed (Figure 5).

In response to slectrodermal stimulation, phasic advance of tension rhyth: of the
posterior hypothalamus in relation to the rhythm of projection zones of the cortex
and especially its sensorimotor region increased to a mean of 36-60 ms. All this
was associated with an increase in maximums of cross-correlation functions (0.67),
which were more marked when compared to slow waves of the sensorimotor region. At
the same time the phase shifts between the posterior hypothalamus and reticular
formation, on the contrary, diminished. Dispersion of tension rhythm increased in
subcortical structures, whereas these changes were insignificant in the cortex. In
the intervals between stimuli, we observed similar though somewhat less marked
changes in maximum of cross-correlation functions, dispersion and periodicity of
the process. Although the phase shifts increased, they were still less marked
than during direct electrocutaneous stimulation.

By the 30th-45th stimuli, which were irregular, more significant changes were
observed in the EEG parameters studied, not only during delivery thereof but

in the intervals between them. These changes were recorded over the entire inter-
val of EEG activity betweennociceptive stimuli, which was indicative of formation
of pretriggering integration. As in the case of direct nociceptive stimulation,
these changes were manifested by more significant phase lags in slow waves of

the tension rhythm of cortical regions, as compared to the posterior hypothalamus,
reaching the half period or more (67-90 ms).

Dispersion of tension rhythm was substantially increased in subcortical structures
(16-18), whereas in the cortex, on the contrary, it was decreased (4-5.5). Hhile
the major phase shifts were episodic at first, particularly in the background
between delivery of electrodermal stimuli, after repeated use of stimuli these
changes became increasingly stabilized. It should be stressed that the phase
shifts were somewhat greater between BEG potentials of the posterior hypothalamus
and sensorimotor cortex than in the relations between the hypothalamus, temporal
and occipital regions.

After delivery of numerous irregular stimuli there were some distinctive features
to the cortico-subcortical cross correlations, which consisted of a decrease in
functional relations of the posterior hypothalamus with all cortical regions and,
to a greater extent, the sensorimotor region (Figure 6). In 90: of the cases,
the phase shifts were associated with a decline (0.15-0.3) of maximums of cross—
correlation functions of the sensorimotor region and posterior hypothalamus. In
the temporal region, the phase discrepancies were 10-25 ms shorter than in the
sensorimotor cortex. In 821 of the cases, these changes were associated with a
decline of maximum of the functions (0.2-0.3). Finally, considerable phase
shifts in the occipital region, in relation to the posterior hypothalamus, occurred
later than in the sensorimotor and temporal regions, and they were somewhat less
marked. The maximums of cross-correlation functions declined (0.2-0.35) in 76%
of the cases.

The decline of cross-correlation function maximums was also associated with signi-

ficant decrease in dispersion in the cortex. particularly its sensorimotor region.

All this was indicative of the fact that multiple delivery of electrodermal stimuli
led to a drastic decline in functional state of the cerebral cortex and attenuation
of its relation to subcortical structures.

In contrast, closer functional relations were established between the reticular
formation of the brain stem and posterior hypothalamus, which were manifested by
completely synphasic low waves of tension rhythm, increase of maximums of cross-
correlation functions almost to the limit (0.9-0. 99) and increased dispersion in

both subcortical structures to 15-25, which was indicative of increased excitability
of these structures (Figure 6). The stable cortico-subcortical correlations estab-
lished at this stage persisted in subsequent experiments (Figures 7, 9). .

As for mathematical expectation of electric
potential of the structures analyzed, the
lack of change therein is one indication
that there was no impairment of stability
of the 226 during formation of emotional
stress.

Expressly during this period, the changes in
cross-correlation parameters of tension
rhythm in the intervals between stimuli
were the most significant and virtually the
same as those demonstrated during delivery
of the stimuli. It is important to note
that these stable changes persisted con-
tinuously during the entire interval be-
tween stimuli. Vocal reactions appeared
not only in response to the stimuli, but
between delivery thereof. At this stage of
emotional tension the rabbits presented
dyspnes. up to 250 excursions of the

chest and acceleration of cardiac activity
to 300 beats/min (Figure 8). The animals
became restless, aggressive, presented more
frequent motor reactions manifested by
twitching and even convulsive seizures,
attempts to break away; some of them chewed
through the wires; there were instances of
aggression against the experimenter. Some
animals urinated and defecsted. After the
experiments, there was heightened motor
activity in the rabbits' behavior: as soon
as the cage door was opened to give then
water or food, the rabbits lunged and
tipped the dish. This excited state was
often associated with distinctive "growling."
Some of these symptoms were associated in
some animals with passive defense reactions
of the "anxiety" [alarm] and "fear" type,
while others were overtly in the nature

of aggressive "rage."

After numerous stimuli, the changes in
various directions referable to the

hypothalamus- cortex and hypothalamus-reticular formation became very stable:

no appreciable change to the end of the experiment in response to the stimuli or
in the intervals between them, i.e., for 6-8 h (Figure 9). At this time, the
coefficient of variation for the curves of distribution of maximums of cross-
correlation functions was significantly lower than at the start of the experiment,
which was indicative of stabilization of cross correlations. In the next

experiments (starting with the second), such correlations were demonstrated in
background EEG activity even prior to delivery of electrodermal stimuli, which was
indicative of already formed pretriggering integration of the nocioeptive emotional
reaction. In view of the fact that stressor features in tension rhythm analogous

to electrodermal stimuli were recorded also during the entire interval between
stimuli and persisted in subsequent experiments, we can mention a rather important
point: continuity of emotional tension in time during irregular delivery of stimuli,
which is indicative of the animal's constant readiness for nociceptive stimuli
(Figure 9).

Figure 8. BBC, respiration (R), EKG and EMS following numerous deliveries
or irregularly timed electrodermal stimuli [same key as Figure 2]

Delivery of numerous irregularly timed stimuli [68, 76, 147] caused a decline of
cortical energy level and attenuation of its functional relations to the hypo-
thalamic emotiogenic zone, the excitability of which significantly increased
(Figure 10).

According to the conceptions of I. P. Pavlov, a decline of cortical function and
its functional relation to the "subcortex" could be indicative of development of
"protective inhibition" in the higher parts of the brain when exposed to "excessive
stimuli."

Analysis of changes in parameters of tension rhythm of the cerebral cortex, as
related to the hypothalamus, revealed certain differences. Thus, EEG changes

To answer this question, we submitted tension rhythm of the posterior hypothalamus
in relation to slow EEG waves of the ventromedial hypothalamus, amygdala and
thalamus during formation of nociceptive stress to statistical processing.

Analysis of cross-correlograms (Figure 4) revealed that the slow waves of the
subcortical structures studied were essentially synphasic before delivery of
electrodermal stimuli in relation to the posterior hypothalamus. The functional
relations determined from the maximum of cross-correlation functions of slow waves
of the posterior hypothalamus in relation to slow waves of subcortical structures
were on the average in the range of 0.6-0.7; they were highest in relation to the
medial thalamic nucleus and lowest to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. The
first deliveries of electrodermal stimuli to the posterior leg of the rabbit induced
slight (16-25 ms) phase shifts in tension rhythm, mainly of the posterior and ventro-
medial hypothalamic nuclei and an increase in maximum of their cross-correlation
functions. These changes were less marked than the cortico-hypothalamic parameters.

116
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

After repeated electrodermal stimulation, the phase shifts between these structures
increased to 67 ms and functional relations to 0.76 (Figure 5).

Thereafter, the phase shifts reached an average of 75 ms and became stabilized to
the end of the experiment, but the maximums of cross-correlation functions dropped
to 0.3-0.35 (Figure 6). As for the amygdala, the phase shifts of electric poten-
tials did not change in relation to slow waves of the posterior hypothalamus. 0f
caurse, there were analogous findings in the intervals between stimuli. However,

in this time, the other parameter of tension rhythm-maximum of cross-correlation
functions between these structures-increased (0.76).

After 50-70 stimuli, the phase shifts of slow waves between the amygdala and pos-
terior hypothalamus began to increase to 68-70 ms, and they were associated with
decline of functional relations to 0.37-0.4.

Subsequent delivery of numerous irregular electrodermal stimuli elicited an in-
crease in phase shifts between slow waves of the medial center of the thalamus and
posterior hypothalamus. Concurrently, the maximum of cross-correlation functions
between them dropped to 0.4-0.63. These relations between the posterior hypo-
thalamus and analyzed subcortical structures became stabilized and persisted to
the end of the experiment (Figures 6, 7).

It should be noted that dispersion of tension rhythm increased in all of these sub-

cortical structures, but less than in the posterior hypothalamus and reticular
formation.

In analyzing the physiological mechanisms of pretriggering integration, it should
be noted that, as in the case of electrodermal stimuli, there were analogous
changes over the entire interval between stimuli. This was indicative of the
continuous nature of formed emotional tension with irregular stimuli.

Under these conditions, synphasic correlations and a high level of functional
relations of EEG tension rhythm between the posterior hypothalamus and reticular
formation were found to be the most stable (Figures 6, 7).

Thus, in the course of formation of nociceptive stress there were changes in
correlations between pacemaker structures of nociceptive motivation and projection
regions of the cortex, as well as various subcortical structures of the brain's
limbic system.

The process advanced against the attenuated background of interaction of projec-
tion zones of the cerebral cortex with the posterior hypothalamus. There was an
increase in phase discrepancies and decrease in functional relations of the ventro-
medial hypothalamus, smygdala and medial thalamic center with the posterior hypo-
thalamus. Disruption of relations between subcortical structures intensified

the state of tension. Indeed, we know from the literature that not only the
cerebral cortex, but various subcortical structures of the limbic system can have

a restraining effect on emotiogenic centers of the posterior hypothalamus and
reticular formation.

He know [39] that reciprocal relations between electrical activity of anterior

and posterior parts of the hypothalamus are disrupted under the influence of noci-
ceptive stimuli. These changes alter hypothalamo-cortical correlations and cause
formation of negative emotional states.

and the cortex and other subcortical structures of the brain. What distinctions
are then observed?

Analysis of cross-correlograms revealed (Figure 11) that, before electrodermal
stimulation, the slow waves of the anterior hypothalamus were generally in anti-

phase (77-102 as) with the analyzed brain structures, whereas maximums of cross-
correlation functions were in the range of 0.6-0.66.

Use of electrodermal stimuli elicited changes in phase correlations, which began
with a decrease in phase shifts between slow waves of the sensorimotor cortex and
anterior hypothalamus. After 30—45 irregular stimuli, the slow potentials of

these structures (1) became synphasic, while maximums of cross-correlation func-
tions increased to 0.57-0.6.

After several exposures, a synphasic tension rhythm was also established between

the ventromedial (2) and anterior hypothalamus. The level of functional relation
rose to 0.6-0.67.

Continuing electrodermal stimulation elicited a decrease in phase shifts of slow
rhythm of the amygdala (3) and anterior hypothalamus. The shifts in phases between
the structures reached virtually zero values, and were associated with an increase
of the maximums of cross-correlation functions to 0.56-0.7.

After delivery of numerous electrodermai stimuli, the same changes in phase shifts
in relation to the anterior hypothalamus occurred in tension rhythm of the medial
thalamic center (4). The maximum of cross-correlation functions rose to 0.65-0.72.

Numerous and irregular stimuli led to formation of the same changes in parameters
of tension rhythm over the entire interval between these stimuli as during delivery
of the stimuli. The altered correlations between the cortex and subcortical
structures of the brain under the inediate effect of stimuli and in the interval
between them, which became stabilized, persisted without noticeable changes to the
end of the experiment.

Thus, we observed an inphase state between slow waves of the senaorimotor cortex,
ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, amygdala, medial thalamic center and
anterior hypothalamus, which was recorded on a different phase level, shifted by

a half period in relation to the slow waves of the posterior hypothalamus (Figure 11).

On the other hand, the shifts of slow waves of the same structures, in relation to
the reticular formation and posterior hypothalamus increased to the half period or
more, and were associated with decrease of functional relations. The phase shifts
that were present prior to electrodermal stimulation between the anterior and pos-
terior parts of the hypothalamus (99-102 ms) decreased to 65-75 ms at this stage

of stress and were associated with an increase of functional relations to 0.5-0.68
(5). Perhaps, the functional "approximation" of these two parts of the hypothalamus
was related to heightened excitability of its posterior part, which also "captured"
other parts, including the anterior one.

The persistent changes in different directions in phase shifts and maximums of
cross-correlation functions of tension rhythm of the cortex and subcortical struc-
tures indicate that, in the case of delivery of numerous irregular electrodermal
stimuli, disruption of reciprocal relations is not limited only to the anterior

and posterior hypothalamus. Hith regard to the latter, changes arise in different
directions in parameters of tension rhythm of cortical and various subcortical
structures of the brain. These changes are instrumental in forming stable negative
emotional states. The posterior hypothalamus and reticular formation, the excita-

bility of which increases significantly, play the leading role in generating tension
rhythm.

Thus, functional relations and phase shifts characterizing the time and space corre-
lations between the analyzed brain structures could be one of the indicators of
organization of heterogeneous components of the functional defense system.

Electrographic Parameters of the Brain of Animals Hith Predisposition for
and Resistant to Emotional Stress -

He discovered other patterns in the second group of animals, in addition to the sub-
mitted results referable to the analysed statistical parameters of tension rhythm.
They consisted of the fact that, after delivery of the first 2-5 electrodermal
stimuli. there was significant increase in phase shifts (75-108) and maximums of
cross-correlation functions (0.66-0.71) of hypothalamo-cortical correlations. These
changes were observed both during delivery of stimuli and intervals between them.
The new cortico-subcortical correlations were also associated with significant
heterodirectional changes in dispersion of tension rhythm: increase in the posterior
hypothalamus and decrease in the cortex. After delivery of 5-10 more stimuli the
functional relations began to diminish (0.26-0.3) between the cortex and hypothalamus.
At this time, similar changes also occurred in electric potentials of the posterior
hypothalamus in relation to slow waves of the ventromedial nucleus, amygdala and
thalamus. A complete coherence [synphasic state] and high relationship (0.95-0.99)
were noted between the posterior hypothalamus and reticular formation. This per-
sisted stably to the end of the experiment (Figure 12).

Thus, after delivery of several nociceptive stimuli. the second group of rabbits
rapidly developed a stress state with the typical changes in statistical parameters
of tension rhythm, autonomic components and behavioral reactions. Some rabbits

of this same group presented faster pretriggering integration. He found that, in
the first experiment, even before delivery of electrodermal stimuli, there were

changes in analyzed parameters inherent in such states between the slow waves of
cortical and subcorticsl structures.

Thus, the mere fact that these rabbits were immobilized constituted an effective

psychoemotional stressor, eliciting the typical negative emotional reaction with
all of the typical changes in correlation parameters of EEG potentials.

It should be noted that most rabbits in this group presented heightened excitability,
even before the experiments were started. In their cage, the animals displayed
typical avoidance reactions, receding into a corner. During immobilization, they

were restless, escaped from being held in the hands and had vocal reactions; urina-
tion and appreciable dyspnea were often observed.

In addition, the hypothalamo-cortical phase shifts were slower and appeared only
after delivery of 30-50 nociceptive stimuli in rabbits constituting the third
group (Figure 13). In some animals, even after delivery of numerous stimuli in

the first experiment, there was no impairment of coherence of EEG tension rhythm

121

of the analyzed cortical and subcortical structures. This was associated with in-
crease of maximum of cross-correlation functions (0.77).

It is only in the second experiment, in the same experimental situation, even
prior to electrodermal stimulation or after delivery of several stimuli, that sig-
nificant (60-70 ms) phase shifts appeared, which were associated with corresponding
changes in autonomic and behavioral reactions. The conditions, under which the
animal had first been submitted to numerous emotionally unpleasant stimuli, were
rather potent factors capable of causing the entire set of changes in parameters
that were typical of negative emotions. however, these changes were less marked

in this group and they were associated with somewhat "diminished” hypothalamo-
reticular functional relations (0.75-0.8) and partial coherence.

After delivery of numerous stimuli, the hypothalamo-cortical functional relations
remained high-O.6-O.7 (Figure 13).

The changes in cortico-subcortical correlations related to individual distinctions-

of the third group of rabbits were indicative of greater resistance of their defense
mechanisms to stressors than in animals of the first and second groups [71].

Cross-Correlograms of Electrical Potentials of the Brain During Delivery of
Numerous 'Stereotypically Timed' Stimuli

The data obtained in the preceding series of experiments revealed that immobilized
animals in a situation "without signals,“ submitted to numerous irregularly timed
electric stimuli, experience constant and continuous tension, since they were unable
to anticipate the time of delivery of emotionally unpleasant stimuli.

What changes will occur in the dynamics of formation of negative emotional excita-
tion in the central nervous system when, under the very same experimental conditions,

animals are submitted to regularly timed electrodermal stimuli, i.e., when the
factor of chance is eliminated?

In this series of experiments, the effects of nociceptive stimuli were related to
a constant time interval.

Delivery of numerous regularly timed elactrodermal stimuli increased the probability
of anticipating the moment of delivery of emotionally unpleasant stimuli.

P. K. Anokhin indicated that "when any criterion having a bearing on the organism
is put in order, it already leads to organization of the system." As we know, I. P.
Pavlov was the first to use the expression, "system," which was created during
formation of the dynamic stereotype, i.e., 1n the case of delivery of the same
stimuli in a recurrent order.

EEG studies revealed that, in the case of a fixed dynamic stereotype, for each
forthcoming stimulus the brain automatically (on the basis of prior conditioning
[or training]) prepares a state that qualitatively reflects expressly the stimulus
that had been used many times in a given place.

Regularly timed electrodermal stimuli elicited the same typical changes in statis-
tical parameters of the tension rhythm BBC as irregularly timed ones.

However, in the case of delivery of numerous regular stimuli there were some distinc-
tions pertaining to intervals between regular stimuli, i.e., pretriggering integ-
ration of the functional system (Figure 14). It should be noted that the direction
of changes in cross-correlation parameters of tension rhythm in the intervals be-
tween stimuli was the same as during delivery of the electrodermal stimuli.

123
lllltﬂﬂﬂCIAl.lEiECHULY

Thus, after delivery of the first regular stimuli, the background EEG activity pre-
sented an increase in [base shifts, maxim-s of cross-correlation functions and
periodicity of tension rhythm. These changes were equally demonstrable in both

the first half of the interval, closer to the end of stimulation, and in the second
half, just before delivery thereof. In other words, at first the formation of pre-
triggering integration was the same over the entire interval between stimuli.

By the time stressors were delivered 30-50 times, the phase shifts and maximums of
cross-correlation functions became more marked in the intervals between stimuli.
However, in the first half of the interval between stimuli they were less marked
than in the second half, just prior to delivery of pain. During this period, there
was some differentiation of changes in pretriggering integration in different inter-
vals: attenuation thereof in the first half and accentuation in the second, just
before delivery of the stimulus (Figure 110).

From this time to the end of the experiment, maximum changes in cross-correlation

parameters of tension rhythm in the intervals between electrodermal stimuli coin-
cided with the time of delivery of the stimuli.

Thus, after delivery of numerous regular electrodermal stimuli, pretriggering integ-
ration, which includes the acceptor of action result, is not formed over the

entire interval between signals, but is manifested in accordance with the law of
dynamic stereotype, just prior to delivery of the electrodermal stimulus (Figure 14).
There is final to nation of pretriggering integration of the functional system,

and it persisted not only to the end of the described experiment, but in subsequent
ones.

As compared to experiments, in which irregularly timed electrodermal stimuli were
delivered, in the above experiments there were less marked changes in autonomic

and behavioral reactions. The rabbits were restless and aggressive, but to a
considerably lesser degree. There were less frequent vocal reactions in the inter-
vals between stimuli, and they occurred mainly just prior to delivery of a stimulus.

Comparative analysis of cross-correlation parameters of tension rhythms in the two
series of experiments revealed that the typical changes in cortico-hypothalanic
correlations were less marked with regular use of stressors than irregular use.
And, while the situation of irregular delivery of the stressor "holds" pretriggering
integration of the functional system in a state of "continuous tension," analysis
of the EEG rhythm in the case of delivery of numerOus regular stimli revealed that
its stressor characteristics appeared at a certain time, namely: exclusively at

the time of delivery of the stimulus, and they were virtually restored to the
background level after it (68). For this reason, in the case of regular stimuli,
organization of the stress state occurs more slowly. with periods of decline of
emotional excitation imediately after electrodermal stimulation.

Chapter 1. Theory of Functional Systems—Cybernetics of Living Things

The conception of general theory of systems advanced in the early 1930's
by L. Bertalanffy consisted of a general approach to large and complex systems

of different types: engineering, socioeconomic and biological, including ecological
communities [11, 102].

121;
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR‘0FFNJAI.USE¢MVLY

Living organisms, as systems of a probabilistic nature, are notable for extreme
complexity that is difficult to describe mathematically. The inherent distinction
of such systems is that there are many interrelated variables that depend on
numerous endogenous and exogenous factors.

P. K. Anokhin observed that the "exceptionally rapid growth in number of publica-
tions in the area of biological sciences, narrow specialization and appearance of
new synthetic directions evokes a sense of helplessness in the face of the profusion
of unsystematized information, and renders difficult collaboration between allied
disciplines."

In this regard, the great physicist, Oppenheimer, stated in 1957 that "the more
a researcher knows, the more he is aware of his ignorance" [50].

However, as far back as 1872, Claude Bernard observed that "the time will come
when many specialists--philosophers, and poets, and physiologists-«will speak the
same language" [11].

At the present time, expressly systems analysis is the most constructive approach

to synthetic problems of life, as it generalizes numerous and diverse analytical
factors [10, 12].

Bxpressly general systems theory makes it possible to present the results of a
refined analytical experiment in conformity to the specific patterns of the
integral behavioral act and, as P.K.Anokhin says, "to span a conceptual bridge
between these two approaches.“ Thus, it becomes possible to identify precisely
the results of an analytical study of a large system.

It should be noted that the principle of "open reflex arc" of Descartes (1646),
as it applies to living things, remained unchanged in the works of I. P. Pavlov, who
discovered the conditioned reflex in the early 20th century.

In 1933, Academician P. K. Anokhin proved that there is a fourth element--feedback-—
which closed the arc. This is how theory of functional system of the organism
emerged, which proved that its activities are based on self-regulation principles

[7, 93]. P. K. Anokhin's functional system theory (Figure 1) views living organisms
as self-regulating and dynamic systems, which have broad adaptation to changes in

the environment. It is expressly through self-regulation of functional systems

that there is manifestation of cybernetic patterns of life that are aimed at main-
taining a positive adaptationsl result. Theory of information, control and feedback-
the basis of cybernetics-can be applied with success to functional systems [93].

N. Hiener,the "father of cybernetics," related the prospects and main problems of
biology expressly to self-organizing systems [30).

What is a system?

L. Berta1anffy [5, 51, 102] defined system ”as any set of interacting elements";
others [11] observed that "system is everything that consists of interrelated parts."
More recently [11], "the aggregate of elements related to performance of some
function" is referable to systemic phenomena. However, such general definitions

do not specify the real patterns of system function, since they apply to all
phenomena in nature. The definition of system supplied by P. K. Anokhin is

125
ltﬂl(ﬂﬂﬂ(JAl.USElMNLY
FOR OFFICIAL,U5310NLY

the most accurate. First of all, he observes that "if one accepts the definition
of system as being only interaction of a set of elements, there would be unimagin-
able chaos in our brain that would not allow for any organized purposeful action."
For example, the number of degrees of freedom of all neurons, i.e., all the
possible interactions with one another, is so large that it would be hard to

write down on a piece of tape 9,500,000 km long. For this reason, the entire
question is to single out the factor that limits the number of degrees of freedom
of aimlessly interacting elements in the system.

According to Anokhin, the useful end result is the factor that limits the degrees
of freedom of various elements of a system (Figure l).

A functional system does not consist simply of interacting components of the
system, joined in a whole to obtain the useful end result for the organism [11].

"Functional system refers to dynamic organization of structures and processes in
the organism which, independently of their anatomical and physiological classifi-
cation, alter their architecture with exceptional flexibility in the search for

a programmed result, which plays the part of a system-forming factor in selective
mobilization of its different components" (P. K. Anokhin).

As we know, one of the distinctions of biocybernetic systems is their hierarchic
structure, i.e.. any system of a lower level is an element of a system of a
higher level.

It is apparent that all of the lower level systems interact with one another and
with a higher level system, being subordinate to the latter. It is important to
note that this interaction occurs essentially according to the results obtained
in each of the systems. This means that the hierarchy of systems changes into a
hierarchy of results.

Theory of functional systems is a universal physiological model of the function of
the organism.

Afferent synthesis is the initial stage of a functional system. At this stage,
there is concurrent processing of information from triggering and situational
afferentations, motivation and memory that dominate at a given time (Figure l).
Simultaneous processing of all four components is important, since it is only in
such a case that each of them acquires the appropriate physiological characteris-
tics. Expressly this property relieves the neuron from numerous degrees of
freedom.

It is a known fact that many researchers are concerned with the time of fixation
of information in the problem of memory. "This is unquestionably an important
aspect; however, the center of events shifts from fixing to retrieval from memory
of the information needed at a given time in the problem of setting a goal

and decision making by the functional system" (P. K. Anokhin). In this case, we
could be amazed at the ease and accuracy of such retrieval [11, 12].

It is very obvious that it is extremely pressing to study this mechanism of memory,
and that it is impossible without simultaneous interaction of all four elements
of afferent synthesis.

126
FOI»OF11CJAI.USBIDNLY
NR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

This stage ends with setting the appropriate goal and making a decision for action
(Figure 1). Let us mention that, unlike the most refined automated control systems,
decision making occurs within the biosystem itself, not imposed from the outside.

Making a decision relieves the organism of many degrees of freedom and forces it
to effect only one form of behavior.

It must be stressed that the mechanisms of decision making are extremely complex
and are still the most mysterious, and they must be worked on more effectively

in the future. Thus, formulation of this problem ensues directly from theory of
functional systems.

The value of a functional system lies not only in its methodological meaning,
which relates the most refined analytical result to a large system, but in formula-
tion of new research problems.

The system of action result acceptor is formed on the basis of afferent synthesis,
after making a decision, concurrently with efferent messages in the brain
(Figure 1).

In this anticipation system, the parameters of the model of the expected result
are predicted in advance. Thus, real events are overtaken. The parameters of

the results of a performed action are compared expressly to the parameters of this
model by means of feedback. When the parameters coincide, a positive emotional
state develops and the search stops (Figure l). Noncoincidence of parameters is
associated with a negative emotional state. A correction is made in the action
through self-regulation mechanisms, and the search with the appropriate correction
continues until the parameters coincide completely [93].

It should be noted that until the rehuired positive result is obtained excitation
reverberates in so-called "anticipation circles" of the acceptor of action results.

The parameters of the actually performed action are compared expressly to these
"anticipation circles" by means of feedback. This is a manifestation of self-
regulation of the functional system, which is a cyclic process aimed at regulating
any parameter of the organism or maintaining it at a specific level.

Thus, anticipation of real events is of adaptive importance to living organisms.
Let us cite a well-known example [54]. An animal having heard a danger signal
becomes alert, but does not run even though its entire body is ready to run: the
heart starts to function faster, respiration rate increases, the muscles are
tense, etc. All of the complexes are directed toward assuring a positive adaptive
result.

The most important distinction of the organism to anticipate the parameters of

the result of an action not yet performed is used extensively in modern cybernetic
machines. For example, the processes of rolling, aircraft flight are simulated

on computers much faster than real processes. If the real processesdb not coin-
cide with preprogrammed ones, there is automatic readjustment of the control
systems. Thus, like a living organism, the cybernetic machine [automaton] is

able to anticipate [foresee].

Bxpressly the systems approach is the most effective in developing and using auto-
mated systems for analysis in the most refined analytical studies of complex
physiological processes in the integral organism.

Some Numerical Characteristics of Random EEG Processes

It is known that the EEG can be viewed as a sequence of locally stationary processes
[57, 29]. This makes it possible to use, for analysis of the BBC, the correlation
method that is one of the special cases of demonstration of nonrandom parameters

of stochastic processes. The increasing use of this method to study complex EEG
processes that have probebilistic-statistical organization [51] is attributable to
the advantage of statistical analytical methods, accuracy and stability of the

demonstrated parameters. The correlation function can be written down in the
following form:

._...I T
An, m - 7:13 7 j Ixm-yu +«)Idt.
0

Since we are dealing with finite processes, integration time (T) must also be finite:

. . T
a, m = ﬂ Ixm-ya + M]

where x(t), y(t) are current values of functions, T is integration interval and r
is the shift in time of one process in relation to another.

1. With 3(t) - y(t) wehave an autocorrelation function, i.e., the same signal is
analyzed. The autocorrelogram enables us to characterize the mean frequency and

degree of expression of dominant rhythm in one lead and does not contain phase
information.

2. with x(t) i y(t) we have a cross-correlation function, since :(t) and y(t) are
different signals referable to different leads. Cross-correlation analysis deter-
mines the expression and frequency of the common periodic component of the two

EEG processes examined. These components are singled out, even if their amplitude
is considerably lower than that of random components. Cross-correlation analysis

permits demonstration of the quantitative dimension of functional relationship of ~
the two processes.

With a maximum relationship, this parameter tends toward one, whereas with
statistically independent processes it tends toward zero.

3. Cross-correlation analysis makes it possible to determine the phase or time
correlations between two analyzed processes according to the shift of maximum of
the functions along the time axis. If there is no phase shift between two EEG
processes, the correlation function is "even" [has parity?], and the function

maximum is indicative of a zero shift, while other values thereof may either be
the same or smaller {57, 29].

As we know, there is a relationship between the nature of the correlation function
and internal structure of the random process corresponding to it. Depending on
which frequencies and in which correlations prevail in the random function, the
correlation function has one appearance or another.

128

Hith t - 0, the autocorrelstion function has a maximum value and numerically equals
dispersion:

where mx is mathematical expectation, 3i is the value of a variable in the
measurement and n is the number of measurements.

The overall EEG process can be submitted in the form of the sum of harmonic
oscillations of different frequencies. The spectrum of the sac process is a func-
tion that describes the distribution of energy [power] over different frequencies.
Thus. the spectrum demonstrates the internal energetic structure of a given process.

The spectrum of a stationary random function shows the distribution of dispersion

over different frequencies. Dispersion is the square of standard deviation of the
random function from its mean value.

Spectral density 8(m), or energy spectrum of the process under study (distribution

of dispersions over component frequencies), is the energy of the process averaged
in time in the range of Af frequencies.

Rx(t) and S (w) are closely interrelated and mathematically defined by one another
using formulas of Fourier transformation:

In the case of analysis of the EEG, dispersion could serve as its precise amplitude
characteristic for the segment studied [48].

Since a change in a stationary random function must proceed homogeneously in time,

obviously the constancy of mathematical anticipation could be one of the indicators
of stationariness of mathematical expectation:

Principles Involved in Construction of Equipment of Automated Systems
for Computer Processing of Physiological Data

In view of the fact that there is an increasing tendency toward moving from quali-
tative to quantitative descriptions in physiological research of complex, random
processes, there is a greater need to refine methods of analyzing experimental data
[18]. we refer, first of all, to the use of appropriate analytical methods by
means of modern electronic computers. It becomes extremely important to use auto-
mated systems for processing physiological information. Automation of processing
of the results of physiological experiments requires a set of equipment that trans-
forms, gathers, stores and inputs biological information in computers [4].

Input of physiological data into a computer is done as follows: 1) conversion of
analog information into a numerical code and input in the computer in the course
of an experiment, i.e., in the "real time scale"; 2) digitizing biological data

and punching them on pupertape or recording them on magnetic tape with subsequent
input in the computer.

Depending on the nature of experimental work and software used, either of the above
variants may be given preference.

In the first variant, data processing on a computer haa"real time scale" makes

it possible to conduct experiments that are controlled by feedback. In the

second variant, in the course of gathering data it is also desirable to "control"
the experiment, i.e., set the mode, duration and epoch of analysis, monitoring

the conversion and recording of information, forming working codes and signals, etc.
In the first variant, these functions can be assumed by the computer. In the
second variant, where recording and processing of biological data are "spaced in
time," it is desirable to use a device that must be able to control reproduction,
starting, reading and inputting information in the computer.

A. The staff [42 of the institutes of cybernetics and physiology, Azerbaijan
Academy of Sciences, under the leadership of Academician G. B. Abdullayev,
corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, developed a special set of
equipment to automate processing of physiological data on a computer (Figure 29),
consisting of the following components: 1) multichannel analog—code converter
designed to convert analog biological data into a digital code. Quantization in
time and fixing analog values in all channels are done in parallel to eliminate the
phase shift between input channels of the converter. Conversion into digital code
and recording on tape are done successively. There is magnetic tape storage for
recording and reproducing information that has been digitizedandworking codes
(Figure 29 [not reproduced]). 2) The analog-digital recording device consists of

a matching unit, analog code converter and perforator. In the analog code con-
verter the following conversion principle is used: ateachquantization step deter-
mination is made of the increment: of input signal, which are stored in input
recorders. For this reason, binary codes are formed in the output register after
a certain number of quantization steps in time, from which one can determine,
during computer processing, the numerical values of readings of the corresponding
”segment" of the signal. The number of bit positions in the output register of
the converter is taken as being equal to the number of tracks on the papertape.
For this reason, one can record physiological information on series-produced
perforators, the operating speed of which is 2-3 times slower than the frequency

130

FOI10FFNJAL.US£(MULY

of conversion of input signals. 3) The programming device is intended to automate
control of experiment mode and stimulation of the biological object, formation of
signals at the start of conversion and zone number. This unit performs functions
thatprovide for proper operation of the complex in the modes of retrieval and input
in the computer of data from the magnetic recorder, as well as output of the
perforator directly into the computer during the conversion process. 4) The unit
that controls retrieval and input is designed to search for the zone number on
magnetic tape, as well as tags indicating its beginning and end. In addition, it
serves to receive digital and working [service] information, checking accuracy of
its reading, packing [atacking2] and transmission to the computer. There are
provisions in this device for linking it with different types of computers '
(Figure 29). 5) A unit that digitizes in conjunction with PL-80 or PL-lSO perfora-
tors performs the same conversion also for punching on the papertape of multi-
channel nonintersecting tracings recorded by electroencephalographs, analyzers and
other instruments. The converters have been developed in two variants which

use the effect of illumination of diagram tapes by a reader [read-out?] beam.

Inthefirst variant, this is done by moving the infinite opaque tape with "reading
slits," and in the second, by turning the opaque disc with transparent "reading
slit.” Hhen light passes from the source through the mask slit, which is curvi-
linear, a "reading beam" is formed. During scanning, it moves over the trajectory
set by the mask slit. At the moment the reading beam intersects the curve, the
light guide with a photomultiplier turns dark and the value of the graph ordinates
is fixed on the meter. The Speed of conversion corresponds to the speed of the
fastest modern keypunch machines.

Use of the above devices together with a computer increases significantly the
operationality, precision and quality ["level”] of processing biological data.

3. The set of equipment [37] for processing physiological data on a computer,
which was developed at the Institute of Normal Physiology imeni P. K. Anokhin,
USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (Hoscow) consists of instruments that are in the
immediate vicinity of the biological object and in the central equipment

(Figure 30).

Recording part of the complex: As can be seen in the flowchart (Figure 3), informa-
tion from the object is fed into a 16-chsnne1 encephalogrsm of the Alvar Firm

and from its amplifiers over commnucation lines to the central equipment commuta-
tion panel. Then the electric potentials are transmitted to direct current ampli-
fiers of a type HN-7 analog computer for compensation of interference and amplifi-
cation. Amplification is performed by means of 10 transfer [transient] amplifiers
so that the output of the encephalograph (or frequency analyzer) matches the input
of the "analog code" converter. Each transfer amplifier has three cascades with
symnetricnl output designed to alter the input signal in the range of :15 V. The
frequency characteristics of the amplifier with disconnected load in the range

of 0.1 to 50 Hz has nonuniformity not exceeding 3 dB.

EEG theta rhythm, singled out by the frequency analyzer, passes to the "analog code"
converter for conversion of the analog signal into the pulse code required for input
in the computer. Concurrently, there is production of working signals passing

into the programmer. The "analog-code" converter has 10 input channels, and it

is designed to code continuous signals from the transfer amplifiers in a

131
FonioifﬂﬂAl.USEIDNlY
FOI.0FFKJAI.USEt0NlN

"semizaryadnyy" [typo for 7-bit?] binary code. Each channel is "interrogated" at
a frequency of 120 or 400 Hz. After the converter, the coded signals pass

through the matching devices into the lG-channel magnetic type Astra recorder. The
magnetic code recorder [pen] serves to record'and store in coded form the signals
coming from the "analog code" converter. Thus, the recorder serves as a buffer
memory that permits "separation in time" of obtaining and processing information.
The recording is made only at the intervals selected in advance. During recording,
the data array is marked into zones by means of the generator that is started by

the pulse-controlling programmer. A separate track on the magnetic tape is used
for this purpose.

Operational part of complex: Two experimenters(physiologist and operator engineer)
participate in each experiment, and they control the equipment. During the
experiment, a stimulus is delivered to the object in the form of audio, photic or
electric signals. The order of delivery of stimuli is specified in the program
that is prepared before the start of the experiment. If necessary, the experi-
menters can alter the program of delivery of stimuli in the course of an experiment.

The prograumung device operation is based on choice of a specified impulse from a
sequence and producing. in accordance with the time of selection, the controlling

pulse signals specified in the program. In this case, the "cycle" signal from
the "analog code" converter serves as such a sequence.

The programming device has three independent channels. The signal from each channel
is synchronized with either of the other two. Signals from these channels control
external equipment. They consist of square-wave pulses of positive and negative
polarity. In addition. the programming device has a unit for production of ”loading”
pulses (positive and negative polarity) the duration and recurrence frequency of
which are altered by leans of switches.

The beginning and end of generation of loading pulses are strictly synchronised
with the leading and trailing edges of the controlling pulse by means of the cycle
signal.

The "loading" pulses serve to synchronize the frequency and duration of stimuli.

The program can be started by two methods. manually or from an external generator.
The program is cleared either by the "reset" button or trailing edge of the control-
ling pulse. The data are recorded for 60 or 50 s, in accordance with the progran.
when processing on the computer, the zone marking makes it possible to input frag-
ments of EEG information that correspond exactly to the tine segments of the back-
ground, stinulus or aftereffect period.

Biosignsls can be put into the computer fron papertape, punchcards. as well as
directly free the "analog code" converter or magnetic code recorder. The device
for inputting data fron the converter and magnetic recorder consists of a circuit
for retrieval of a specific data array by the number of its zone and a circuit
for channel selection for the purpose of selective input in the computer.

After processing on the computer, in addition to output on papertape and print-out,
the data are transmitted to the "code analog" converter for conversion of binary
numbers into their analog equivalent and simultaneous distribution in 10 channels.

The Question of 'Han-Hachine' Systems

The set of equipment for automated processing of physiological data on a computer
makes it possible to calculate the different parameters of couples BBB waves of
the brain (Figure 29) quantitatively in accordance with the program.

In the case of preliminary recording of biological data on the magnetic recorder

and subsequent processing on a computer. the processes of recording and processing
are "expanded in time." In this relationship between the computer and brain, the
latter is an object of effective investigation. After such quantitative analysis
and "parametrization" of physiological functions. their "language" becomes
"understandable" to the machine and the complex can be switched to the ”real time
scale" mode and mode of controlled experiments.

Demonstration of information processes of the brain on the "real time scale" opens
up wide opportunities for studying brain activity.

If the codes of electric potentials of the brain corresponding to different events
will be identified on a real time scale, with translation thereof into the pre-
cise language of feedback [opposites] in the environment. the specific electric
activity of the brain will become a "model of behavior" that is accessible to
investigation and practical application.

The point of the above-mentioned experiments is that converted biological informa-
tion is fed directly to a computer and, depending on the results of analysis,in

the course of the experiment the appropriate opposite influence is exerted on
any adjustable parameter.

In view of the relationship between the controlling action and result at the output
of the system, one can calculate with precision the result of the action of various
stimuli in order to alter the activity of the system in the required direction [50].

The principle of dynamic organization of complex biocybernetic systems with many
feedbacks requires continuous multiparameter regulation, without which the system
cannot exist.

The possibility of maintaining a specific state of the organism from the outside,
with a computer, in the presence of variation of many variables, plays an important

part in increasing the resistance of the system, which is instrumental in purpose-
ful self-regulation [50. 54].

As can be seen in Figure 1, it is the most expedient to connect the automated
system on the route of dissemination of the brain's commands to various peripheral
organs or in the feedback circuit. Such a method of artificial self-regulation
makes it possible to select the best mode for any functional system of the organism
or, if necessary for research purposes, to “mismatch" the instructions issued by
the brain and transmitted by the electronic device. Controlled experiments become
particularly valuable in the study of self-regulating adaptive mechanisms of
resistance of the organism to extreme factors and stress, as well as in the search
for the means of influencing them effectively and selectively. In such controlled
experiments, the organism is the object of effective influence on the part of the
controlling computer.

The possibility of programming and mathematical formalization of physiological func-
tions makes it possible to conduct a second type of controlled experiments with
such a set of equipment, where the biological object itself-the brain-emerges

as the main controlling element of the system. “hat is the main purpose of this
aspect of research?

in the presence of intensive scientific and technological progress, there has been
a drastic increase in requirements of automated systems of control of complex
objects. However, one encounters major difficulties in this direction, which are
related to the need to process an enormous amount of diverse information and
organization of optimum consistency [matching] between man and a computer. In this
respect. there is also the acute problem of developing the software to describe
thinking processes and intelligence [16, 72].

For example, the difficulties involved in solving the most complex problems of
national economic significance consist of the fact that, although the exact aethod
of solving them is known-~complete sorting of variants-this route leads to such
enormous calculations that even a computer cannot handle them. As a problem grows
more complicated the number of computer operations grow like an avalanche, which
leads to processing of an enormous amount of information [54]. All this requires
huge resources and time.

Thus, if modern computers were to play a game of chess with complete sorting of 15-
20 moves in advance, it would take them years. At the same time, a grand master

of chess would need considerably less time and calculations for his next move [26,
103].

The human brain, being the optimum control system, has an entire set of indicators
constituting its intelligence that enables it to solve the most complex problems
the most efficiently with extremely little sorting. It is aided by the possibility
of effective evaluation and screening of information by means of eliminating sense-
less actions, as well as the ability to formulate new tasks, problems and to use a
creative approach to solving them [103].

Attempts to develop such technical systems with high ratings like living organisms
are often limited by the capabilities of modern electronics, although some narrowly
specialized machines could be superior to even man in some parameters (for example,
speed and calculating capacity of computers, etc.). however, these are merely

a few parameters of the millions that exist in brain activity. For this reason,
when solving the traditional problem of a machine's ability to be "smarter" than
man, one must compare the entire aggregate of parameters, rather than individual
ones. In this respect, it is opportune to mention the graphic expression of P. K.
Anokhin to the effect that a motorcycle could be "smarter" than men with respect
to the one criterion of speed [63, 72].

In the opinion of P. K. Anokhin, "the ability to set a goal and make a decision,
rapid change in various types of activity, as well as the presence of the system of
emotions and intuition, extensive adaptive properties, anticipation of current
events and flexibility, reliability and economy-is a far from complete list of
indicators of superiority of the brain over the most sophisticated electronic
control systems, including computers" [1, 63]. These distinctions of the human
brain are related to the activity of billions of neurons and a fantastic number of
correlations between them. There is not a single person whose memory is completely
filled. However, A. H. Thuring [56], the English mathematician, who expanded

the theory of finiteness of the brain, believed that if one were to feed into a
computer a prepared set of answers to all sorts of questions. the machine could
replace human thinking. C. Shannon very validly objected: "According to Thuring.
there would be no differences between a person who solved a problem through
thinking and an individual who memorized the solution in advance." Indeed, in

Thuring's model, the creative process, as one of the main indicators of human
intelligence, does not exist.

It will be impossible to give a machine the above-listed qualities of the human
brain and, in particular, emotions, intuition, genetic information, acquired

life experience, self-awareness, etc., until thorough studies will have been
made, primarily of their finest neurophysiologicai and neurochcmical mechanisms.
ﬂoreover,algorithmizationand development of theampropriate software to build
models of these processes constitute one of the most difficult tasks for modern
science. It should also be added that the International Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (in Repino, 1978) arrived at the conclusion that “it is impossible
at the present time using only numbers and calculations" on computers to force

a machine to "think creatively," to create intelligence similar to man's in the
complete sense of the word, "who not only can do everything but is also able to
want to." For the time being, we could be dealing with enhancement of some func-
tions of the brain and in rather limited areas at that--“chess computers,“ various
dialogue systems and so-called "intellectual robots."

However, at the present stage, the advances in robot construction are related pri-

marily to devices that help relieve man of nonintellectual, heavy and monotonOus
work.

For example, manipulator arms, which do well on some lathes, scientific robots,
the Lunokhod [LEM], etc., have gained fame in industry.

Another aspect of this problem has also gained a firm foothold. Nervous impulses
of the brain intercepted on the way toward man's extremities help control powerful
actuating servo-mechanisms that are used as artificial limbs, arms [manipulators]
for handling reactive [nuclear] substances and thermal diving suits.[or space
suits]. The reaction speed increases by a factor of 10. Man, so to speak,
"completes" [builds on to] himself.

If we were to trace the trend of computer development from the first to the third
generation, from lamp [tube] to semiconductor types based on integral circuits,
multiprogran ones with universalization of language of communication with the
operator, we would see that, although the process of development is directed toward
the principles of function of the human brain, it is still very far from its capa-
bilities. Suffice it to mention the huge problem of forming the purpose of control.
A computer cannot set goals or make decisions. They are specified from the outside,
by man, on the basis of his mind and motivation of behavior which are determined by
exogemus and endogenous needs (Figure 1). Hence, the so-called "information
hunger in cybernetics, due to the shortage of incoming information and intellectual
hunger related to the limitations of a computer's black and white formalism" [26,
1.3]. "The computer, which made it possible in principle to relegate to a machine
many aspects of brain activity, encountered some serious obstacles in creating
artificial intelligence" [92].

For this reason, at the present stage, one should seek the solution to the problem
of developing new, more sophisticated automated control systems for complex

processes in the direction of using not only purely electronic systems, but
combined neuro-electronic ones.

According to the conception of P. K. Anokhin, which discloses the main patterns of
cybernetics of living things [93], all functions of the organism, from molecular to
complex forms of behavior, are integrated into a whole on the basis of highly

self-regulating functional systems (Figure l), which is indicative of the effective-
ness of creating combined neuro-electronic control systems.

More and more often, there is discussion in the press of questions of making
practical use of combined biocontrolled systems [140].

A combined brain-docket system is proposed in an article by Kelly [156]. After
preliminary train ingd the cat's brain to identify a specific object, which
arouses the animal's interest, it is connected into an electronic system. When,
during an actual flight, the required goal appears on the screen, efferent nervous
impulses will close the control triggering circuit. The instinct of a cat, which
is such a remarkable mouser, helps it make a very accurate estimation of the
jumping distance, speed of approxination and automatically react to evolution of
the goal.

Such combinations simplify significantly the problem of pattern recognition and
identification. However, development of combined systems has its own difficulties.

Apparently, among the least difficult problems are those related to interaction
between electronic systems and living cells, introduction of the transfer function
of the living into the retrieval or guidance system. It is much more difficult to
maintain viability of brain tissue when a living organism or part of it is used

for a long time in the complex. Hithout this, the system immediately becomes
inoperative [incapable of work].

Machines that are controlled by man constitute a special category of systems. The
study of their properties, complexity of controlling modern machines and the need
of optimum conformity thereof with the natural qualities of the human body is
becoming an increasingly important task of our times.

Optimum distribution of functions among man and a computer increases the rating of

the entire system. Such complex biocybernetic control systems consist of both
living and nonliving elements [50].

Intensive research is being pursued in this direction: dialogue systems are being
developed, which make it possible to communicate with a machine in the usual human
language; systems are being developed for direct communication between the brain
and a computer (the operator poses a mental question concerning course, speed,
altitude of flight or means of solving more complex problems and the answer appears
immediately on a "display").

Man of the future will, so to speak, link up with an electronic brain, and the
closer such a brain will be to human intelligence, the stronger will be both the
brain of man and of the entire system.

At an annual meeting (1977) of the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences, Academician G. B.
Abdullayev, president of the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences, indicated that develop-
ment of a solitary computer-brain combination at this stage would expand the
capabilities of the computer with respect to making logical decisions based on
abstract concepts, it would blend the high intuition and intelligence of the

brain with its broad computing capacity.

6. B. Abdullayev made special mention of data [129, 138, 160] concerning a complex
systeunofdirect visually monitored control of action currents of the brain through
the operation of a computer (Figure 31).

The demonstration unit consisted of a computer and "display" with a relatively
simple maze marked on it, in the center of which a small mouse symbol moves
(Figure 31).

Arrows were secured along the edges of the screen showing the direction of move-
ment (up, down, to the right and left).

The subject participating in the experiment was situated in front of the television
screen. Several sensors (5-6) were attached on his head which picked up weak
electroencephalographic signals that were then amplified a million times and, after
being converted into a discrete form, inputted in the computer. In the course of
this experiment, while solving the problem of guiding the "little mouse” out of the
maze, the subject looked closely at the arrow required at that particular time,
which indicated the direction of movement. The computer, receiving the signals
from the brain's action currents. processed them and issued the appropriate

commands on the display, thus causing movement of the "little mouse" in the required

direction. Hith proper decoding of impulses of the brain's action currents by the
computer, 12 commands were sufficient to guide the "mouse" out of the maze, i.e.,

just as many as would be needed to perform this task by means of a control console.

A total of 12 people participated in turn in controlling the computer in this manner.
The computer underwent preliminary instruction about the "control style [handwriting]"
of each subject, their complex controlling action currents. The mean level of

proper classification of information on the computer constituted 901, whereas a 991
level of precision is required for practical use of this method.

Work in this field is continuing, and the experiments that have been conducted enable
us to outline the routes of future research.

This method of transmitting commands on a computer can be used, for example, to
control machines and industrial processes, as well as in various emergency situa-
tions when it is necessary to turn something on or off rapidly. In practice,

this means that upon detecting a deviation of any parameter of a unit that is
controlled from the outside, it will be sufficient for a man to "issue a mental
order" to change the parameters in the desired direction. In the future, such bio-
logical control will help develop a "routine" standard brain--computer linkage.

It must be noted that, for example. several tenths of a second are required to
transmit control signals over radio, whereas less than 0.1 s is needed for direct

control of brain action current impulses. To what can we attribute such a high
speed of control?

As we know, the human operator's transfer functions, which consist of transfer
functions of the eye, ear, neuromuscular system (movements of the limbs, articula-
tions, position), have a strong influence on the quality and effectiveness of
control (speed, precision, reliability). Each transfer function introduces its own
time leg or even "error" into the control system. For this reason, the most
optimum conditions for control are to rule out intermediate transfer functions,
i.e., to develop a system of direct control by a computer of the brain's action
currents and the process [object].

For example, when an operator decides to depress some computer button, the impulses
formulated in the brain extend over different levels, analyzer systems, through
many cortico-subcortical pathways, pyramidal and reticulospinal tracts and

effector organs.

of course, this long and complex route traveled by a signal, which is picked up at
the final stage of the functional system (Figure 1) takes much time. The probabi-
lity of errors increases, and it is also closely related to the operator's psycho-
emotional state.

The high speed of control when there is a direct link between the brain's action
currents and a computer is achieved as a result of collecting information at the
early stages of formation of functional systems (P. K. Anokhin), at the stages of
afferent synthesis, or acceptor of result of action (Figure 1). This provides for
a minimum number of transfer functions. In experiments of this type, it is quite
sufficient to take information from the surface of the cerebral cortex. As we
know, each complex function related to processes of thinking, learning and
visually monitored reactions has its own cortical localization. Nevertheless, we
should mention the important role in these processes of subcortical structures as
well: reticular formation, superior colliculi of the lamina tecti [quadrigeminal
plate] and others. The brief primary component of the evoked potential (8?) could
serve as an electrographic parameter, which reflects arrival of information to

the cerebral cortex. However, during processing, one must take into consideration
more complex potentials that correspond to events (PCB). The PCB include sensory,
motor, so-called "long-latent" potentials and artefacts. Detection and identifica-
tion "on the real time scale" of these bioelectrical processes in the brain, which
are related to various controlling commands of the biological object, require a
special approach. Thus, although averaging methods have a number of advantages

in detecting a weak signal in the presence of severe noise, there could be
disappearance of the minutest EEG changes. For this reason, one uses identifica-
tion of a signal for one run to identify the controlling commands of the brain

on a "real time scale." This principle is the most effective, in spite of the
fact that it is quite difficult to adhere to it because of the fine variability

of PCB and effects of artefacts and instrument noises.

The software for processing action currents on a computer in the course of bio-
controlled experiments is based on construction of a solving rule by means of
heuristic programming. The processing scheme consists of a priori elimination

of artefacts, use of Wienerianfiltration, choice of tag vector, classification of
epoch, as well as recursive elimination of ejects [138, 160].

It should be noted that rigidly determined programs cannot reproduce the higher
logical functions of the brain and cannot take into consideration all of the
unforeseen changes in complex, random action currents, which depend on numerous

endogenous and exogenous factors. Loss of information increases even more when
signals are classified for a set of subjects.

The probabilistic-statistical principle of organization of the brain enables it to
find the most purposeful behavior in rapidly changing situations, on the basis of
few base data, prior experience and intuition [72, 92], by the very shortest route,
without examining senseless variants. This means that the ability to creatively
solve the most complex problems with the least calculations is one of the main
advantages of human intelligence over computers.

Thus, the brain has ways of reducing calculations, inherent only in it, and this
is still among theunsolved mysteries of heuristics. Heuristic programs, which are
used extensively in chess-playing computers, make it possible to depart from
sorting to a significant extent and delineate the route over which one can achieve
the most success. In assessing the chess position, the rules of the game are

put into heuristic programs, which can subsequently alter the criteria for 853688-
ment and become improved [26, 72, 92]. The championships that have been held
among chess computers revealed that the most promising programs were not the ones
(of the "brute force" type), in which emphasis was laid on complete sorting of
variants in the "truncated tree" of c. Shannon and speed of the computer, but those
in which as many unnecessary moves as possible were eliminated from the "sorting
tree," i.e., those that best approximated the way a chess master would play.

Thus, the greatest achievements are made with programs, in which there is less
need to "calculate" and greater depth to the moves.

Heuristic programming of chess games on computers is very important to analysis
and modeling of logical thinking. to future development of artificial intelligence
and control of complicated industrial processes that require great calculations.

The so—called gyromatic programs of D. A. Pospelov and V. N. Pushkin, as compared
to heuristic ones, are more based on theory of functional systems (P. K. Anokhin)
and patterns of human thinking, which expands their capabilities significantly.

A gyromatic program forms the model of a future result, in which there is reflec-
tion of the gyromat and its correlation with the environment. Here, the obtained
result is compared, by means of feedback, to the programmed model, while solving

the problem with appropriate correction, like in the functional system, continues
until there is total coincidence. In the opinion of its authors, the gyromat may
even have a "consciousness" [26, 54].

Gyromats are multiprogrammed, they have a complex hierarchy and perfect themselves
from problem to problem, so that one can solve on a more sophisticated level
problems related to decision making [92].

It should be noted that both heuristic and gyromatic programs are merely special
methods, which cannot totally replace human thinking. However, such simplified
conceptions make it possible to "program" some narrowly specialized functions of
the brain. Only broad use of theory of functional systems will help simulate in
the future the entire aggregate of parameters of human intelligence and develop
the most refined automated systems for the control of complex processes without
the participation of man.

Thus, development of new systems "encounters" a number of difficulties in differ-
ent directions of science, which are related to the limited capabilities of modern
electronics, computer software and the problem of artificial intelligence. However,
at this stage, development of a solitary brain-—computer complex with optimum
conformity, which would combine the advantages of the living and electronic systems,
would expedite the solution of complex control problems in many respects. Regard-
less of how effectively some direction or other will develop. the "systems approach"
to the study of this problem is indisputable and, as a result, so is the mutual
enrichment of neurophysiology, medicine and electronics.
