SUZUKI'S POVES BELIEVED ALIENATING PUBLIC SUPPORT

“Political Morals"!

Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki bas reshuiiled the
cabinet and the Liberal-Democratic Party executive
posts. leaving the bad impression that politics iollow
a diiierent way oi. thinking irom normal common
sense. .

Politicians should be modest in reading the
people's mind and conduct the aliairs oi state in a
way to win the support oi the people. Susuki neglected
this point in iorming his new cabinet. or at least tailed
to show us any insight. courage or ability.

The deterioration oi political morals has come
into the spotlight oi late. especially since the
Lockheed aircrait scandal suriaced in am. Suzuki
must have been well aware oi this but judging irom
the new cabinet and party lineup. we see a wide gap
regarding the Lockheed scandal as viewed by the
general public and that by the prime minister and the
ruling party.

Suzuki should have avoided the appointment at
Susumu Nikaldo as LDP secretary general because
he is a suspect in the scandal and regarded as a proxy
oi iormer Prime Minister itakuel ‘i‘snaka. a deten-
dant in the Lockheed case. The appointment has
created suspicion because oi the enormous power
N ikaido enjoys in the Japanese political structure.

However. Suzuki ignored the public and some
LDP opposition and Nikaido got the post. We believe
there is an ulterior motive involved. Suzuki earlier
pledged the establishment oi political morals. in-
dicating that he would Keep some distance irom
Tanaka. and many voters apported Suzuki because
thb seemedtoshowbehadeommonsense.

The voters’ expectations. however, have proved
um "I"! I“ INF "VI \

to be an Illusion. Suzuki has surrendered himself to
the intraparty theory which pays respect to
numerical strength. He must have thought it ad-
visable to do this because. In this way. he could
prepare for the LDP presidential election next year.

Suzuki also succeeded in rejecting requests to
appoint Mutsuiti Kato. another suspect in the scandal.
as a cabinet minister apparently fearing that Kate's
ropointment would unfavorably affect the political
" eoihis cabinet.

We do not accept the way of thinking that a
suspect or so~calied “grey" person can be accepted as
a ruling party executive member but is not suitable
for a cabinet post. He is overly optimistic If he expects
to offset criticism over the appointment of Nikaido by
turning down Kato.

Concerning this. former Prime Minister Takeo
Fukuda reportedly said. ominously. that the ap-
pointment of Nikaido would lead to a political “ex-
plosion." We share Fukuda's view. Such major posts
as secretary general. acting secretary general and
Diet policy chairman have also been filled by
members belonging to the Tanalta faction, indicating
that the LDP has seemingly turned into a “Tanaka
'Camp" with the possibility of stronger iniiuence oi
the former prime minister in Japanese politics.

The disa pearance oi factions opposed to
Tanalta's lea ershlp does not necessarily mean the
attainment oi LDP unity. We do not believe such unity
would be healthy because the party could not function
without a more balanced system. We even foresee a
political crisis in 1982 when judgment will be handed
down in some oi the Lockheed trials.

Moreover. we are afraid that the public will
become more apathetic toward politics, and will
regard the new lineup as Suzuki's approval of money
politics symbolized by 'l‘analta. This will further the
recent social trend in which corruption and the
demands of vested interests have gained prominence.

in the cabinet. men who are considered in-
fluential or who are expected to become inﬂuential in
the near future have assumed top posts. Suzuki must
exert his leadership to help these members function
properly. lie must also take care of various problems

INCREASING DEFENSE SPENDING
'l'okyo ASMlI EVENING NEWS in English 1.2 Nov 81 p 3

[From "Politics 5 Politicians" column by Michisada lltrosc, chief researcher,
ASAltl SllIMBUN Analysts and research Center]

[Text]

The bill to cut overnmental
expenditure. whic was draft-
ed on the basis of a report
by the Extraordinary Admmis-
trative Research Council. is
now before the Upper House
alter being passed by the
Lower House. As is well
known. this re rt called for
Cu“ in expend ture for social
welfare. education and almost
all other fields of govern-
mental activity. but it tacitly
approved the Government's
policy of increasing defense
spending.

The Amhi Shimbun‘s recent
acquisition of the council's
shorthand minutes has pro-
vided a full plcture of delibera-
lions conducted by the Gov-
ernment‘s advisory body on
administrative reform. The
minutes show that Government
officials made the most of
the comnutment to the United
States on greater defense
spending.

Dcfcttw spending was dealt
with by the council‘s No. l
special committee. headed by
Macro Kumei. The following
exchanges took lace between
menthcn and o ﬁeials of the
Dcfeme Agency:

Kiymhi liiima. political
commentator: The United
Staten is expected to press for
an incrensc in fiscal I982 dc~
fcnsc spending at various levels
on the strength of the Japan-
US. inint communique of

May. What is the Govern-
ment's assesstncnt?

Hisakatsu tlteds, counselor
of the Defense Agency: Prime
Minister Suzuki pledged an
even matter effort to President
Ronald Reagan. so the United
States is watching what action
Japan will take. Despite the
1.6 percent increase in fiscal
I981 defense spending. Presi-
dent Carter advised us of his
disappointment. Our greatest
concern is isolation tn the
Free World. We must do our
best to act in concert with
the defense buildup efforts of
other countries.

Shoii Sumita. adviser to All
Nippon Airways and a former
ranking official of the Trans-
port Ministry: ] understand
that the United States is ask-
ing the Government to bolster
maritime defense power. It is
underuandable that the Mari-
time Self-Defense Force
should undertake mine-sweep-
ing operations in .l
waters and port and
defense. but I find the pro-

posed protection of ocean-
qorn; convoys incomprehen-
sthle.

Japan‘s merchant marine
now amounts to 50 million
tons. tncluding ships of for-
£0.11 registry. Is it possible
to protect so many ships?

The Foreign Ministry had been showing
willingness to respond to a US request Ior
cooperation In military technology In order
to soothe the US dissatisfaction with Ja-
pan as much as possible. But the stir arose
when it became evident that cooperation
in mlﬂtary technology Includes weapons
export.

A certain newspaper Wednesday carried
the full text at "the government's opinion
on weapons export to the US.” The ac-
companying commentary set forth tho lol-

"Inconsistent Prime Minlsthr")

Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki. upon completing
the reshufﬂe of his cabinet and lineup of the Liberal-
Democratic Party executives. reiterated his deter-
mination to deal with the many urgent problems
which our nation faces today. His remarks, made at a
press conference on Dec. 1. were most disappointing
as he failed once again to demonstrate his leadership.

There was nothing new about his statement. He
discussed many subjects at length from a very broad
standpoint but did not go into details. in addition.
criticism is running high because of his appointment
of a " grey politician" as party secretary general. but
Suzuki attempted to defend his choice of Susumu
Nikaido. saying that he has been working sincerely
for the cause of the nation and the party.

in connection with administrative and fiscal
reconstruction. the prime minister declared that the
most important task now is to restore the people's
trust. What is truly needed of politicians today is
morality. We are fed up with money politics and
political corruption.

We are not at all satisfied with his explanation.
How can he restore the people's confidence in politics
when he himself named the boss of a "plutocratic
LDP faction" as party secretary general? in the face
of his breach of faith. whatever he says is hardly
convincing.

He also emphasized that this country will make
its own decisions on defense independently of the 0.8.
request for increased military capahllty after taking
into account all factors. such as the war-renouncing
Japanese Constitution, budgetary matters and public
opinion. With m to ”swam-lemmas

with the Republic 0! Korea. Suzuki said he would
handle the issue within the scope ol contributing
toward the stability at the people’s livelihood and
economic progress ot the ROK.

llis contention on these issues was abstract. but
we admit that the direction he is pursuing is correct.
The problem is that he has often gone astray lrom his
intended course. and he' has betrayed our ex.
pectations by tailing to demonstrate iehdership.

We now call on the prime minister not to say one
thing and do another. He should remember that lack
of leadership and inconsistency are iatal.

We have to cope with this
age oi channes cautiously
but boldly. But there isone
problem which makes it
diﬂicuit to cope with the
use of changes. It is the
population explosion in the
world.

world population, which was
one billion in 1830. to reach
two billion but during the
short space of so years
irorn that to two. the world
population increased to
three billion and then has
risen to H billion today. It
has been forecast that the
figure will reach 6.2 billion
by the end of the present
century.

Can this earth. in this
“lie of ﬁnite resources and
enemy. support this ex-
ploding population? Will

come at energy? Will our
livmg environment remain
healthy?

Needless to say, curbs on
the population should be
studied as a method to
solve this problem. but the
problem will not be settled
by that alone. We have to
hammer out revolutionary
countermeasures on the side
oi supply and distribution
of resources and energy. In
other words, we have to
take up the problems of
"population" and "develop-
ment“ as the main themes
in our eliort to cope with
this age oi violent changes.

Food and energy should
be the principal objectives
of development tor the time
being We have to encour-
age eliorts to increase food
production in developing
countries Brains and ﬁnan-
cial resources of the whole
world should be mobilized
to undertake various studies
aimed at developing non-
oli energy sources, such as
nuclear fusion.

We have to overcome two
hurdles. One is the impend-
ing crisis and the other is
the limited availability or
resources :nd energy. Only
when we overcome these
two hurdles. mankind will
be assured of survival and
happiness.

At its thmday national convention which ended
'l‘hnnuisy. the Komeito party formally decided to
modify its policies on security and defense. The po-
licy shift, which apparently aims to place the party
in pouition to take part in some future government.
virtually concedes that the defense forces are con-
stitutional and also commits the party to continue
the Japan-US security treaty.

It has taken Komeito four years to reach its new
policy after a series of intrapsrty debates. Since the
issue involves the party's basic principles. the con-
vention focused on winether the new policy did not
contradict the party's fundamental antiwar stance,
and also whether there was no danger of becoming
associated with the Liberal-Democratic Party's
(LDP) defense buildup position.

Komeito executives dismiued all these doubts,
saying that there were no grounds to fear that the
party was leaning toward the right This will have
to be proved by the party' a future behavior.

No True Position

Any political party seeking to come into power
some day needs to propound realistic policies in or-
der to gain wide public support. it is therefore non-
sense for the Komeito to say that it will sanction
the status quo. It means that the party has no true
position of its own What one expects of an opposi-
tion may are ﬂexibility and functioning to check

the excesses of the ruling party.

Komeito executives resumed the national conven-
tion that the party would uphold the peace-seeking

[Text]

1 would like to express
my beliefs about what Ja-
pan should or can perform
In the international econ-
omy and some other related
problems. My theme is “The
Japanese Economy in the
World Economy."

First. I would like to say
a few words about Japan‘s
position in the world econ-
omy. 1! we examine the
weight of Japan in the
world economy and the
peculiarities or this nation's
balance of payments. we
notice the toliowins tacte:

tainly tndieates tin strength

Third. Japan's trade bai-
anoe he! a pattern in which
the large deﬁcits in trede
with oil-producing coun-
tries are onset by the sur-
pluses in trade with nonoli
developinl countries and
advanced nations.

The facts whtch I have
now pointed out impose a
heavy role on Japan in the
ma nt of the world
economy but they sbo in-
dicate a chronic possibility
that problems-will arise he-
tween Japan and other
countries.

Now. tot us examine the
relattons between Japan
and the rest or the world
under such circumstances
from three angles: Inter-
national specialisation in
trade. capital advances
oversees by Japan and co-
operation in policies.

International
Specialisation

countries of the world

sense. it is desirable that

in a developing country can
moire up tor the shortage
oi savings in the host coun-
try and also contributes to
the improvbinsnt oi its
technological level and
iurnishes an opportunity to
educate technicians and
workers in that country.

Second. each developing
country must have a de-
velopment plan oi its own.
and the structure of in-
dustry envisaged in such a
plan may diner iron the
structure oi industry which
Japan expects to see train
the viewpoint at its process-
ing trade. Theniose. this
diil‘rrence can he a cause oi
criticism that Japan is an
economic aggmor.

Third. -t has been pointed
out as a problem In direct
investment by an advanced
country in a developing
country in general that a
company making capital
advances often imposes dis-
advantageous conditions on
the partner compony in the
host country. such as ban-
ning export oi the products
to areas outside a speciiic
region Such a restrictive
way or melting direct in-
vestment is open to ques-
tion.

The second and third
points should be given
enough consideration from
the viewpoint oi settling
the North-South problems.

Cooperation
In Policies

i would like to discus co-
opemtion in polleieu, which
is my lust theme. tram two
ninth-s: Foreign aid policy
and demand control policy.

in thc- liaiit «i Japan's
min In international nucle-
ly. It gin-s withunt saying
thni. Japan must expand its
niiic-lnl development assist-
mice to developing coun-
tries, but we should re-
member the iollowing three
tilinus:

i-‘irat. the purpose 0!
nmistlm: n developing
country is to back up the
ril’ort tor development by
the developing country it-
eri. it presupposes sell-help
rﬂort by the country which
receive: the assistance. it

4120/90

goes without saying that
the driving force behind ‘e
development and progress
or a nation is the willing-
ness for nation-building or
its people.

Second. both the assist-
ing country and the recipio
ent country should make
utmost andsam to ensure
that the funds furnished in
assistance be used for a-
veiopsnent eitectively and
emcisntiy. '

The third is the import-
ance of technoloucal assist-
ance. in view oi the short-
age of technicians and
skilled workers in develop-
ing countries. more assist-
ance for education and
etanning should be extend-

in foreign aid. an increase
in quantity is not the only
important thing. A more
important thing in foreign
aid is innovative snort
which will be really wol-
comed by the recipbnt
country.

in this connection, i
would like to say a few
words about the cumula-
tive liabilities in nonoii
producing developing coun-
tries. In nonoil producing
developing countries whose
balance-oi-paymsnts posi-
tions tre weak. heavy
deﬁcits in the balance oi
payments are snowbaiiing
and external liabilities are
posing a serious problem. it
such countries income in-
solvent, its elect on the
international monetary or-
der will be tremendous. 'Do
solve this problem. such
steps as isciiitating ﬁnanc-
ing by the M or the
World Bar: and reschedul-
ing that redemptions should
be taten, but a more basic
issue is what to do with
the economic development
or nonoil producing devel-
oping countries. from this
viewpoint. the problem at
nonoil producing develop-
ing countries is vitally
related to the attitudes oi
advanced countries toward
the North-Booth problems.

COUNCIL TO HURRY REVIEW OF ION-TARIFF BARRIERS
Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHMU’N in English 27 Nov 81 pp 5-6

[Text]

The improvement of Japan's non-tariff barriers has become one of the
most important problems to be studied by the Second Provisional Adminis-
trative Research Council (Chairman: Toshio DOKO), with the growth of the
demand in Europe and the US for the opening of the Japanese market due to
the dispute over the imbalance of trade. The Third Department (Director:
President Hasao KANE! of Sumitomo Electric Industries) of this Council has
begun to study earnestly how to simplify and rationalize import procedures,
from the standpoint that the various complicated procedures, which must be
taken to import such item as medicines, food and automobile parts accord-
ing to the provisions of such laws as the Drugs, Cosmetics and Medical
Instruments Law and the Road Transportation Vehicle Law, are partly
responsible for the so-called "closure of the market." Prime Minister
SUZUKI hoped on the 26th that "The Provisional Administrative Research
Council will take upon itself the task of reviewing Japan's non-tariff
barriers, as part of the measures for the reduction of the affairs requiring
approval of administrative authorities." This is expected to give imtus
to the deliberations on this problem. Concrete measures for the improvement
of the non-tariff barriers will be incorporated into the interim report
concerning the reduction of the affairs requiring approval of administrative
authorities, which report the Third Department is scheduled to draw up as
early as in January next year.

The Third Department of the Provisional Administrative Research
Council set up the Sub-Committee on Administrative Business of Approval
(Chairman: former Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromori KAHASRIHA) at
the beginning of October. This Sub-Connittee has been reviewing the
administrative business of approval in various fields for the "reduction
of the people's burden," with major emphasis on such steps as lengthening
of the period for automobile inspection and that for the renewal of
driving licenses. At the outset, it did not attach importance to
inspection of imported items. With the growth of criticism against Japan
in Europe and the US due to trade friction, however, Director mm of the
Third Department recently has instructed this Sub-Committee to hurry the
review of the import inspection system which is regarded as one of the
non-tariff barriers.

"r-.1er ‘.esc circumstances, ?rine Minister SUZUKI expressed his hope
that tie Provisional Administrative Pesearch Council ill taxe up the .
improvement of non- -tariff barriers as part of the measures for the
reductisn of ad. ihist rative business or approval, hen he held consul-
tation with Ch irnan HASHI "0T0 of the Administrative and Fi.1ancia1
:efo Research touncil of the L0? on the way or carrying out admin-
istrativ reform on the 26th. As a result, such problems as simplifica-
tion of import procedures have come to the fore as the most important

problems to be taken up by the Provisional Administrative Research Council
at once.

In Japan. such imports as medicines and food must undergo inspection
in accordance with the provisions 0: such internal Laws as t. .e Drugs.
Cosmetics and Medical InStruments Law and the :ood Sanitation Law. Other
nations are strongly criticizing such import procedures on the following
grounds: (1) Japan does not rec ”3n 9. .a effect or the inspection carried

:t in other countries. naking it necessary for these imports to "1dergo
in pection twice in practice ;(2) Inssection ta<es time because of the
difrere nces in 116- striel standards a. .d other. easons; and (3) inspection
proced1res are often delayed.

he eign nations think that such a svst em of import inspection is
typica a: of non-tarif fcarriers. The US P nvernment recentLy hes prese. .ted
a wr- tten request 0. the following import: (1) to sinpli :y the standards
and inspection procedures for such- tems as 31, dead, automobiles processed
read and cosmetics; and (2) to speed up customs procedures. According to
EITI, he inspection system, the improvement of which has been requested
by other nations. covers about 100 items. RITE says. however, that most of
the stecsr ecu este by other nation can he carried out with the revision
of Cabinet or xinisterial ordi. ences. and not of laws.

'wuuuc comm-momm' T0 u.s. mac-ran A’i‘ rm: CONFERENCE
Tokyo HAINICHI snmuu in English 25 Nov 81 p a

[Text]

According to a.clarification made by a Government source on the
zuth, the Government will request the US to improve the non-tariff bar-
riers (NTB) on trade being imposed for reasons of "consideration toward national
defense," at the Japan-US Trade Group Conference (Japanese side's dele-
gate: Foreign Ministry Economic Affairs Bureau Director General EUKADA;
the US side's delegate: Deputy Special Representative for Trade Negotia-
tions HcDONALD) to be held in Tokyo on December 9 and 10. As a result of
holding talks among Ambassador to the US OKAHARA, who is hole temporarily,
and various Ministries concerned, on problematical points concerning recent
Japan-US trade, it has been decided that the Japanese side, too, should
request the US to apply a brake on import restrictions being enforced
through the operation of non-tariff barriers, "for reasons of security,"
which reasons lack concreteness, in opposition to the US side, which is
seeking of Japan the abolition of non-tariff barriers on high-level tech-
nological products and agricultural products. The Japanese side has decid-
ed to propose the improvement of the policy calling for the purchase of
US-produced goods on a priority basis (buy-American policy) and customs
practices, besides the above-mentioned national defense clause. In connection
with mutual sales campaigns as to high-level technology, which is a strategic
industry, and high-level technological products, Japan and the US will
thrust forth each's new requests, calling for the abolition, or im-
provement of non-tariff barriers.

In regard to the Japanese side's exports of high-level technological
products to the US, there was the case recently where Fujitsu made the
successful best price bid in an international bidding as to the delivery of
optical communications cable to the American Telephone and Telegraph
Corporation (ATT), and where, nevertheless, the Western Electric Company
(US) of the US, which made the second best price bid, became the successful
bidder, as a result of opposition put up by the US Congress,on the grounds
that the use of foreign products for key communications networks will cause
a problem as to the security of the US.

39

FOIIOFFICLALIINEKMVLY
The Japanese Government drew the United States' "attention,"
diplomatically.concerning this case. however, the US side avoided giv-

ing explanations in detail, and it merely cited "for reasons of national
defense."

Besides Optical communications cable, even if Japan wants to pro-
duce lower-priced and better-quality very large-scale integrated circuits
and new-model computers than those produced in the US, while regarding
them as new strategic industrial products, there is the possibility of their
being shut out of the US market, one after another, for reasons of national
defense. because this kind of technology is deeply connected with the
defense production industry of the US. For this reason, the Japanese side
has decided to request the US to exercise self-restraint as to the reckless
invocation of the national defense clause, together with the abolition of
non-tariff barriers. such as the buy-American policy.

On the part of the US, there are many more cases where it establishes
the barrier of interpreting, on an expanded basis, US laws concerned
and import measures, in regard to business talks with Japan for importing
satellite communications equipment, and where it thus protects high-level
technological products. It has been decided that at the Japan-US Trade

Group Conference, the two countries will take up the problem of non-tariff
barriers concentratedly.

Concerning the lowering of tariffs on computers earlier than
scheduled. which the US Government is seeking as a part of the measures
to eliminate the trade friction between Japan and the US, a MITI leader
clarified on the 17th that he is ready to check into it in a forward-
looking way, saying, "Is it not alright to respond to it?" In regard to
this problem, within the Hinistry and computer industry circles, there is
resistance to the lowering of tariffs earlier than scheduled, for the
reason that trade in computers between Japan and the 08 marks a large-
scale excess of exports fmm the US side (an excess of imports to Japan).
The hinistry leader, however, clarified the view that there is hardly any
resistance as to the lowering thereof earlier than scheduled, while
pointing out the fact that the role of tariffs is becoming lower in
recent moves connected with foreign exchange.

According to a Government source, US hinister to Japan BARRACLOUG}!
showed to Government offices concerned, such as the Horeign Ministry and
SITI, the US Government's measures to correct the trade imbalance between
Japan and the US, including the lowering of tariffs on agricultural pro-
products, the simplification of measures for the imports of cosmetics, etc.
and [the lowering of] tariffs on computers, which arean item of interest to
the us, earlier than scheduled. He proposed the conducting of studies at
Japan-US trade group consultations slated to be held early in December .
and at Japan-US Trade Facilitation Connittee consultations.

In regard to tariffs on computers, Japan and the US have reached
agreement on the view, in the course of the Tokyo Round now being carried
out, that they will lower tariffs on the main unit of computers to It.“
by 1987, and tariffs on the peripheral equipment thereof to 6‘, in order
(at the beginning. 10.5% for the main unit -- $.5t for the US; 7.5% for the
peripheral equipment -- 5.5% for the US).

61

FOR omcw. USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

The US Goverment is seeking the carrying out of the schedule for
lowering the tariffs at an early date. Mcently, Japan and the US have
reached agreement to carry out the schedule, which was agreed upon at the
Tokyo Round, earlier than scheduled, as to tariffs on semi-conductors,
which is a similar case.

Hithin NI‘I‘I, however, there is the move that it is not necessary to
lower tariffs on computers earlier than scheduled. as in the case of seni-
conductors, because there was the special situation, as to sub-conductors,
where the export thereof from Japan marked an excess in Japan-US trade.
and that, on the other hand, in the case of computers, imports i'ro- the US
to Japan amounted to #126 billion in 1980, whereas exports from Japan to the US
amounted to ¥2|o.9 billion, thus conversely marking a large-scale excess of
exports from the 08.

Also, computer industry circles are showing a complex look, but
on the other hand, there have appeared persons who show a calm attitude,

saying, "there will be few effects, even if it is carried out
earlier than scheduled, partly because the prices of 18!! products are high."

CAB CNASSIS TARIFF PROBLEM, JAPAN-v.8. CONSULTATIONS END IN FAILURE
l'okyo NIBON KZIZAI SBMUN in English 18 Nov 81 pp a-s

[Text]

Concerning the cab chassis (truck chassis attached with a driver's
cab) tariff problem which has been pending between Japan and the US, the
Government has firmed up its plan to file a complaint with GATT as early
as within this month, in accordance with Article 23 of the GATT Convention.
The US Government raised the tariff on cab chassis, which tariff had been
fixed at four per cent, to 25 per cent, for the reason that it has reviewed
its tariff classification list. Japan thereupon started bilateral consul-
tations, asking for the reduction of the tariff to the original level of
four per cent. “the US side, however, did not accept Japan's request, with
such circumstances as poor business records of the US autonobile manu-
facturers in the background. It is the first time that Japan has decided
to take such a stern measure.

The cab chassis means a truck chassis not attached with a bed. All
small trucks, which are exported fron Japan to the US, are sent in the
form of cab chassis, to be attached with beds and sold as finished vehicles
in the us. Formerly in the US, cab chassis was treated as an automobile
part and was subject to a tariff of four per cent. In August last year,
however, the tariff was raised drastically to 25 per cent, as a result of
a review of the tariff classification list. Consequently, small truck
exports from Japan to the US fell sharply. '

The Government decided that such a step taken by the US Government is
"tantamount to restriction of imports in practice." It started unofficial
consultations after September last year, asking for the reduction of the
tariff to the original level of four per cent. In late July this year, it
put the consultations on an official basis in accordance with Article 22
of the GATT Convention, to continue talks. The US Government maintained
that "It is possible to reduce the tariff on finished cars from 25 per cent
to 6.8 per cent by the President's authority or other means." however, it
refused to cancel its revision of the tariff classification list for the
reduction of the tariff in question to the original level of four per cent,
as the Japanese side strongly requested. As a result, the negotiations had
hard sailing.

It is because of such a situation that the Government has decided to
file a complaint with GATT on the strength of Article 23 of the GATT Con-
vention, which Article authorizes GATT to make decisions binding upon the
parties to disputes, in such forms as advice and arbitration. '

The Government will notify the Us Government in the near future of
its intention to file a complaint with GATT. It will take a formal step
to file a complaint with the GATT Secretariat toward the end of this
month, at the earliest. According to Paragraph 1 of Article 23, Japan
and the US bear the obligation to resume consultations between them for
the co-ordination of the differences in opinions. A Government source,
however, said as follows: "In view of the processes of the negotiations
held to date, it is certain that the consultations will end in failure.
Then. efforts will be started at once for the co-ordination of views
according to Paragraph 2 of Article 23."

According to Paragraph 2 of Article 23, Japan's complaint will be
referred to the GATT Council, and will be examined by a panel (sub-
committee) composed of three to five members in all of the resident
missions of third countries at GATT, which countries are not interested
in this dispute. The panel will make decisions necessary for the assess-
ment of the claims from an objective point of view and the issuance of
recommendations. 0n the basis of these decisions, the GATT Council will

make a final decision on the steps it should take, such as to give
advice or grant arbitration.

According to a Government source, the GATT Council will not hand
down its decision until next summer, at least. If the raising of the
cab chassis tariff by the US is judged to be "guilty," and if the as

does not abide by the ruling, Japan can raise its tariff correspondingly
in retaliation.

Japan-US trade relations have been temporarily stabilized, as a
result of the settlement of the two major issues, that is, procurement
of materials from abroad by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public
Corporation (NTT) and voluntary restraint of Japanese automobile exports
to the US, from late last year to the spring of this year. The US,
however, has come out with a strong request for the opening of the
Japanese market. On the other hand, the Japanese side has expressed
concern, by an exceptional step, over the revision of the US Communi-
cations Act, and has presented a lu-point request for the reduction of
the non-tariff barriers on the US side. It can be said that Japan has
clarified its stern posture by its decision to file a complaint with
GATT over the cab chassis tariff problem, on the heels of these moves.
So, it is feared that Japan-US trade relations may worsen again.

MEWS GIVEN 1'0 REDUCTION OF ALUMINUM PROWCTION
Tokyo MAINICHI sum in English 20 Nov 81 pp 7-8

[Iext ]

Sumitomo Aluminum Refining (Head Office: Osaka City; President: Shozo
SOMA) on the 19th clarified to its labor union (Chairman: dioji WA)
a plan to decrease its output, presently amounting to 190,000 tons a year,
drastically, or by 37 per cent, to 120,000 tone, from January next year.
Among the aluminm—refining enterprises which are depressed due to the
stagnation of demand at home and the inflow of low-priced ingot from abroad,
the closure of plants and the drastic reduction of production have been
carried out in succession. As a result of the decision made by Sumitomc
Aluminum on cutback in production, the total output at home of the six
aluminum-refining companies will fall to the level of 520 ,000 tons a year,
or less than one-half of the total production capacity at present, in
January next year.

Sumitomo Aluminum at present is turning out 80,000 tons a year at the
Isoura Plant (Shine Prefecture), 75,000 tone at the Toyo Plant (shine
Prefecture) and 55,000 tons at the Toyama Plant (Toyama Prefecture). The
plans for the reduction of production at the respective plants will be
drawn up hereafter. Also, the no eeployees, who will become superfluous
due to production cutback. will be sent to affiliated companies.

As a result of Sumitomo Aluminu's decision to cut production. all
of the six aluminum-refining companies are new scheduled to decrease
production. According to the present plans, Nippon Light Metal will
decrease its output to 120,000 tons a year. Sumitomo Aluminum -.- 120,000
tons, Mitsui Aluminum Industries -- 100,000 tons, Sumikei Alunihum
Industries -- 75,000 tons. Hitsubishi Light Metal Industries -- 66,000
tons, and Shows Light hotel -- 37,000 tons, after the turn of the year.
The total output in aluminum-refining industry circles. therefore, will
decrease to 522,000 tons. Previously. the Aluminum Deparnnent of the
Industrial Structure Deliberation Council recotuhended the establishment
of a "Structure for indigenous production of 700 .000 tons in 1985," as
part of the relief measures to be taken for the alminum-refining
enterprises. As a result of the decisions made by these enterprises.
however, the actual output will fall far below the level of 700,000 tons.

0n the other hand, the inflow of low-priced aluminum ingot from
abroad continues unabated. While the price of imported aluminmn ingot
is $1,500 (approximately ¥360,000) per ton C.I.f., the average cost of
indigenous ingot is a little more than ¥SO0,000 per ton, on account of
the high electricity rates. As a result, indigenous aluminum ingot
has lost its international competitive power completely.

According to the Japan Aluminum Federation, imports in the first
half of the present fiscal year (April through September) amounted to
Sus,000 tons, or about 30 per cent more than the amount recorded in
the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. It is considered
certain that tatal imports of alumina ingot in the present fiscal year
will reach, for the first time, the level of one million tons, to
account :‘or more than 60 per cent of the total consumption at home.
Because of these circumstances, the stockpiles in the country are said
to have increased to nearly 1,500,000 tone, or an amount equal to the
annual amount of consumption at home.

EDITORIAL COMMENTS ON FUJITSU'S FAILURE TO "IN CONTRACT

Tokyo JAPAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL in English Vol 19, No 982, 2!. Nov 81 p 10

[Editorial: "Case of Pujitsu"]

[Text]

it occasionally happens that the top bidder in a tender
is denied a contract however excellent the price and
technology it has offered are. But the case in which
Japan's Fujitsu lost out to Western Electric in a tender
called by American Telephone ti Telegraph for a large
fiber-optics communications system looks highly
problematical and unusual in that there was political
intervention from the U.S. Congress.

The incident certainly can be viewed in the context (I
the mounting trade deficit the US. runs with Japan and
as an emerging new area of bilateral economic frictions
springing up from the general American frustrations
about Japanese Nippon Telegraph a Telephone Public
Corp.‘s equipment procurement. Whatever the context.
however. such a move to shut foreign companies out of
the domestic market is quite surprising and regrettable
as the U S. has-always been urging the opening of the
N’l‘T procurement to foreign suppliers.

The very fact that Fujitsu's offer of a fiber-optics com-
munications system was superior to Western Electric's
was admitted by none other than ATT itself. The reason
Western Electric was chosen over Fujitsu in awardim
the contract despite this fact was said to be a problem of
national defense that might arise from depending on a
foreign supplier for trunk communications networks.
National defense is a very convenient word because
when it is cited. a private enterprise finds it difficult to
press for further clarification. But it is hardly
imaginable that adoption of Fujitsu's system would raise
a problem of national defense. and Japan would be
Justified to conjecture that national defense was merely
an excuse used to shut i-‘ujitsu out from the contract.

In this light. it is quite natural and understandable that
the Foreign Ministry is inquiring the us. Government on

the issue. calling Washington's attention to the two ciiun-
tries' agreement signed last year to mutually open
- respective markets to foreign suppliers irrespective of
their nationality. while Fujitsu on its part is going to sub-
mit a report to the US. Federal Communications Com-
mission on details leading up to the successful bidding in
the ATP tender.
It. of course. is unlikely that such moves of the Japa-
- nese Government and Fujitsu would lead to reversal of
— ATT's decision. but what is essential for Japan here is to
speak up what should be said. Silence will be detrimental
not only to Fujitsu but to the Japanese industry as a
whole. Japan should show a resolute stand to prevent
repetition of this kind of unfair treatment. This is all the
more important because the fiber-optics communica-
tions system represents a high technology area where
competition between Japan and the US. is expected to
intensify in the future.
It is equally important, at the same time, that Japan
, keeps its composure on the issue. it should refrain from
any retaliatory action. even though the 08. move can be
used as a pretext to refuse further opening of N'l'l‘
procurement and, in this sense, hardly in the interest of
the US.
Failure to win the contract must indeed be a major
blow to Fujitsu. but the whole affair can be viewed from
a different angle — as a manifestation that Japan's Ii." . -
optics communications technology is already ahe. l of
the U S.'s. This must have done a lot of good to the Japa-
nese. What is important for the both countries is to
reaffirm their commitment to reciprocal opening of the
market.

such as Fujitsu Fanac and Kawasaki Heavy Industries and users such as Nissan Motor
Co. They watch the robots busily working while listening to a talk on the Japanese
custom of using large quantities of robots and then go home.

The number of robots deployed in Japan is said to be 100,000 by some and 70,000 by
others. There is no accepted number. This is because the automated machines known
as sequence robots are sometimes included and sometimes not, so the definition of
robot is not clear.

There are many robots in the United States and Rest Germany. but not more than a
few thousand. The number is much lower in England and France. Japan has over 70

percent of the robots installed throughout the world. when we consider that the
majority of these are made in Japan. it becomes possible to call Japan the "robot

kingdom. "

The progress in production of industrial robots is shown in Figure 1. Many people
called 1979, which say a growth of 55 percent over the previous year, the year of

the robot. However, in 1980, there was a growth of 85 percent. reaching 78.10 billion
yen. A total of 100-120 billion is expected for 1981. Judging by the increased
production tempo of each company, it is highly probable that the growth record will
exceed 50 percent for 3 years running.

Looking at the shipping amounts for each type of machine. we see that while the
growth in low-level fixed or variable sequence robots is weakening playback robots
(which are taught the work procedure beforehand with a manipulator) have grown by
2.8 times, and numerically controlled robots (which are taught the work procedure
with numbers) have grown rapidly, by 9.9 times. These major types have taken over
the aminstream of robot production. (See Figure 2)

0f users who use a large quantity of robots for assembly, spot welding, pressing,
etc, the auto industry is tops with 32 percent of the total (sum of 1979-1980;
figures for the same year are used for companies listed below). The electrical
equipment industry is next with 30 percent. followed by synthetic resins at 10 per-
cent, metal products at 6 percent, and metal processing and steel at 3 percent each.

The electrical equipment industry has drawn attention for introducing 926 numerically
controlled robots all at once. Even though numerically controlled robots at one
time cost only about 5 million yea, the high-level equipment now being installed in
the electrical equipment manufacturing plants costs an average of 23 million yen per
machine. Most of them are assembly robots. The electrical equipment makers have

the advantage of being both the maker and user of the robots, and their enthusiasm
for this equipment rivals that of the auto makers.

The playback robots are also a major type and they are starting to be used in large
quantities for spot welding. Because of the effects of mass production and growing
competition, the drop in price is dramatic. Taking the major user, the automobile
industry, as an example, we find that the number installed has grown by 3.2 times,
from 577 in 1979 to 1,866 in 1980. During this period, the average price has dropped
20 percent, from 9.16 million yen to 7.23 million yen.

Average prices have not dropped in every aspect; the sensor equipment, for example,
has gone up. However, acceleration of an overall decrease in prices is expected.

Potential users will probably continue to be found who are now hesitating.

with respect to price, there is the possibility of a split into two separate types,
that for robot systems including all software and that for hardware-only robots.

The robots directed toward the largest users, the electrical equipment industry,
with its own software, and the auto industry, are tending toward the latter category,
where the drop in price is likely to become much more evident. The drop in price

of the spot-welding robot for the auto industry is an extreme example.

Favorable Conditions in Japan

BUSINESS WEEK reported in the 2 August issue that "the tie-up between Hitachi and

CE will bring about a new phase in the world robot industry competition." It also
presented the warning of Mr Turner. president of a consulting firm: "Just as numer-
ically controlled machine tools and consumer electrical products have taken a beating,
the robot industry will also be hurt badly by Japanese products.

In this tie-up, Hitachi will provide all of its robot production technology and
knowhow to CE for compensation and will supply Hitachi robots by DEM (original

eqiupment manufacturing) to 08 until CB production is on track. This has drawn
a good deal of attention because the buyer is the multinational GB.

I'UR (“IN I“ I“ (|\I \

However, it is not surprising for Japanese robot technology to be supplied to Europe
or the United States. Fujitsu Fanac has also begun negotiations to provide technology
to a British manufacrurer. Medium-size unlisted companies such as Dainichi Kiln),
Yamazaki 'i‘ekko. and liirata Kiko have also attracted the eager interest of big busi-
ness in the United States and Europe.

The following factors can be pinpointed as reasons for the world lead being taken
by the Japanese robot industry. The first and major factor is the high level of
both electronics and precision instrument technology. Robots are a representative
field of mechatronics. and a country like Japan with a balanced development of elec-
tronics technology and machine technology has an advantage. Also, the terriroties
of these two fields are intertwined and there are no obstacles between then.

The cooperation of blue collar workers (welders. painters, assel’olers, etc) in the
factory is essential for development and improvement of industrial robots. In
this area. Japan has an advantage over the United States and Europe.

Industrial robots are basically derived from combined technology and applied tech-
nology. Basic research is not necessarily important. Modification technology—for
example, finding ways to modify the robot's arm or hand to reduce mistakes or increase
speed-4.5 a Japanese speciality. The utilization of workers' stall creative sug-
gestions and ideas is also done well in Japan.

Right now, the technical issues for industiral robots include the development of
sensors, increasing speed, reduction of size and weight, and increasing intelligence.
Sons of these problems requires a revolutionary technological innovation. liost of
them can be solved step by step.

There is no denying the possibility of development of new types of robots built of
lighter materials, equipped with actuators, or having more intelligence in the
United States or l-Zurope. However, overall, considering the latent strength of
Japanese industry. it is doubtful that Japan's advantage in the development of in-
dust! in] robots will be distributed.

Also, Japan has an advantage of location. That is. it is itself a receptive place
for industrial robots. The Japanese-style labor unions, which gladly accept rather
than avoid the use of robots, are a valuable ally of the robot industry.

From the workers' point of view. there are no employment problems connected with
such labor—saving measures as long as the companies retrain and reeducate them.
They expect or implicitly understand that this will rebound in their favor in the
form of higher wages of the company income increases due to higher productivity.

As long as this is the mainstream position of labor, the robot market will continue
to expand.

Relationship of Men and Machines

According to the long-term forecast published by the Japan Industrial Robot Indus-
try Association in March last year. domestic demand is expected to be 200-250
billion yen in 1985 and 370-500 billion yen in 1990. The annual growth rate is

cxpcc ted to be high, 26 to 31 percent through the early 1980's and 13. to 15 percent
in the late 1980's.

63

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR ()FFK'I \l. I'SF UNI)

The same forecast states that there are technological problens that must be solved
for greater distribution of robots. but none that will be obstacles to wider dif-
fusion. The demand r or robots should grow more each year because of increasing
labor costs or shortages of workers in jobs with bad working environments or danger-
ous working conditions.

However, it is said that 20 times the present number of robots will be installed

in factories in the next 10 years and there is certain to be some friction. It is
possible that there will be increasing social problems such as unemployment, loss

of work satisfaction, and widespread alienation. Even if most technological barriers
can be overcome, there is no guarantee that a new uneasy relationship between men
and machines will not turn into an unexpectedly serious problem.

In addition, the export figures estimated in the forecast, 40-50 billion yen in
1985 and 80—100 billion yen in 1990, have the danger of causing friction as an
"exportation of unemployment."

There are also man_. other problems that should be considered by the leading robot

country, such as the possibility of creating a boomerang economic effect by con-
tributing to the rebuilding of European and Alerican industry and the effects on our

relationship with the developing countries.
