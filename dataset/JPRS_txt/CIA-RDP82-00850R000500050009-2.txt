In this, the fourth edition of a collection of articles, attention

has been given to a group of problems having to do with the protection
of the environment from thermal and radioactive pollutants of atomic
electric power stations (A28). The book provides a description of me-
thods for hardening radioactive wastes and a methodology for evaluat-
ing the tolerable ejections into the atmosphere. Several articles in
the book have to do-with the use of computers for automating the moni-
toring and control at ABS's, for training operators, and for preparing
operational estimates. As in previous editions, attention is given

to generalizing and analysing the experience of building and operating
Aes's.

The boon is intended for engineering and technical workers at an ABS,
installation, adjustment and designing organizations.

Foreword

The development of the atomic power industry. in the Soviet Union is
taking on increasing importance. In the near future nuclear energy
sources are to be used not only at the traditional condensation atom-
ic electric power stations, but also at atomic thermal electric power

plants (ATETs) and atomic electric power and heating supply stations
(AST).

An important task in the near future is the expansion of the construc-
tion of AES'e with fast neutron reactors, which make it possible to
more fully use the naturally occurring nuclear fuel. In connection
with this the number of specialists who are being brought in to work

in the atomic power industry. for which the condition of the construc-
tion and operating of ABS's and also the problems of the further devel-
opment of the atomic power industry are of practical interest, is in-
creasing.

The first editions (No I - 3) of the annual collection of articles
"Atomic Electric Power Stations". which were devoted to pressing prob-
lems of designing, constructing and operating ABs's, received recogni-
tion from a broad range of specialists who are engaged in an extensive
number of fields within the atomic electric power industry. This edi-
tion of the collection of articles has basically retained its topics
of concern. which covers a range of problems having to do with the
prospects of expending the use of atomic power for the needs of the
power industry. the further improvement of the designs of the ABs's
and the technical level of their operation. The fourth edition of the
collection of articles devotee a great deal of attention to improving
the systems that control the technological processes and the compre-
hensive automation of ABS's, and also to the enalyais of radiation
safety of existing ABS's and their influence upon the environment.

The editors of the collection of articles hope that these materials
will be useful for the operators. the.specialists of the design and
adjustment organizations, and the scientific workers and engineers.
who are working in the atOmic power industry.

The editors will be grateful for critical comments and suggestions on
the composition and formulation of the collection of articles. All
such comments should be sent to this address: 113116, Moscow. H-Ilb,

LText/ In recent years a great deal of work has been done to substan-
tiate the feasibility of creating water-cooled reactors in reinforced
concrete housings. In this regard it has been demonstrated that all
of the advantages of reinforced concrete housings are most fully mani-
fest when they are used with water-cooled boiling water reactors. In
this article it is shown that on the basis of the special features and
advantages. which are inherent in reinforced concrete housings. they
have managed to provide a degree of safety that makes it possible to
locate an AIETs with a VK-SOO reactor within 2 to 3 kilometers from
the borders of the future infrastructure of large cities.

the operational monitoring of the metal in the equipment of an ABS.
The layout contains the basic groups of parameters. which are subject
to monitoring, which determine the condition of the metal and the
factors of operational effect upon the metal. The layout also re-
flects the scientific articles that have to do with the compilation
of the control programs, the gathering of information on the results
of the monitoring, the processing of data on the condition of the me-
tal and reaching a decision regarding the tolerance of the defects in
operation. The layout work-up was performed using the systems approach
and a concept of the "metal-ABS" system. which characterizes the more
general working conditions and the damage to the metal in the equip-

men: in the operating process.

efficiency of emergency cooling systems of reactors (SAOR). including
the VVER and RBMK reactors, based upon the indicators of the structu-
ral and functional reliability. The structuralrelibility of the
SAOR was studied using the method of the tree of failures. The indi-
cators of the functional reliability were determined on the basis

of the analysis of the temperature regimes of the fuel elements of
the VVBR and RBHK reactors in the process of an emergency cooling and
the use of methods for estimating the thermotschnical reliability.

It was demonstrated that in the existing system designs for the emer-

RADIOACTIVE EJECTIONS OF AN AES WITH VVER-be AND RINK-1000 REACTORS

LKbstract of an article by V.R Koalov: "Atomic Electric Power Stations",
l98l. vyp gl

LTex£7 A comparison of the R36 ejections of series ABs's demonstrates
that for both the absolute value (carie per 25-hour period) and the
relative (curie/HH-year) the actual ejection of a RBHK-IOOO reactor
exceeds by approximately one order the ejection of two VVBR-AAO power
units. It is entirely possible to stabilize the R36 ejections from
one RBMK-IOOO reactor at a level not exceeding 36 curie/(HH-year), i.e.
nearly IOO curie per 24-hour period. This corresponds to the require-
ments of the health rules for the designing and operating of an A38.
The 13‘1 ejections of RBHK-IOOO reactors are of a rather low value,
since in contrast to the VVBR reactors there is a reduced output of
iodide from the nonhermetic fuel assemblies (tvel) into the cooling
agent.

maximums for RBG ejections. based upon the statistical analysis of
the actual ejections of an A38 in conditions of an established regime
of normal operation. It is demonstrated that the distribution of the
normal RBG ejections is subject to a normal logarithmic law, which
can be described by two parameters - the average geometric value and
a standard deviation. This makes it possible to come up with techni-
cally sound working maximums of normal ejections, without restricting
the field of normal operation.

LTeng The radioactive substances (RAV).created by atomic electric
power stations, which enter the environment form fields of increased
radiation as compared with the natural situation. The protection of
the environment from intolerable pollution requires that norms be
established for the release of RAV into the environment for each
source. These norms must cover the concentration and amount of the
radioactive substances that-are formed. This article discusses the
need to standardize the methods for monitoring radioactive nuclides

TASKS OF POWER WRKERS IN 1982 DETAILED
Moscow ELEKTRICHBSKIYE STANTSII in Russian No 1. Jan 82 pp 2-3
[Article: "Tasks of Power workers in 1982"]

[Text] The development of the power industry in 1982 will be carried out on the
basis of a new power-generation program established by the "Basic Directions for

the Economic and Social Developnent of the USSR in 1981-1985 and the Period to 1990"
and in conjunction with the plan for the developnent of the 0883's econony in
1981-1985 adopted by the sixth session of the tenth convocation of the 0851s Supreme
Soviet. The labors of power-industry workers in 1982 must be directed toward the
accelerated development of nuclear and hydroelectric power plants and the supply of
electric and thermal power to the econoay at a rate determined by the specified
scale of industrial production and energy conservation in all sectors of the economy.

The Soviet economy has continued forward in its development. In the first year of
the llth Five-Year Plan, national revenues increased by 3.6 percent in corpsrison
with 1980. while the value of industrial production rose by 4.1 percent.

Within the structure of electric-power production, a further increase has taken
place in the relative share of power production due to nuclear power plants. with a
certain reduction in that portion due to therml electric-power stations. This is
in accordance with the resolution adopted by the 26th CPSU Congress for the develop-
ment of the power industry.

The amount of power generated by all electric power stations rose by 36 billion kWh
over the last year, or 2.8 percent. including an 18.2 percent increase at “5'3

and 1 percent at TES's. Out of the 1,330 billion kﬂh produced by all electric-

pWer stations in 1981. ns's and Tus'e produced 1,063 billion kWh (79.9 percent).
cas's produced 181 billion mm (13.6 percent) and “5's 86 billion kWh (6.5 percent).*
The production of electric power at “8's and 638's in 1981 was equivalent to the
reduction of conventional (fossil) fuel consulption by approximately 85 million

tons. More than 92 percent of all electric power was generated by electric-power
stations in the USSR Ministry of Power and Electrification.

* Henceforth we will present preliminary estimates with respect to the execution of
tasks for 1981.

”WWW!”
FOROFFICIALISEONLY

The production of theml power by centralized sources amounted to 2.315 million Gcal.
It rose by 55 million Goal in comparison with 1980, with a further increase in that
portion of theml power supplied by centralized sources. The output of thermal
power from TETs‘s likewise increased. It amounted to 1.170 million Gcal. including
almost 900 million Gcal from USSR hinenergo TB‘l's's.

More than 10 million k“ of new capacities were co-issioned at the country's electric
power stations in 1981. approximately ’0 million kl! of which were comissioned at
638's and ”38's. New capacities were introduced at the Leningrad ABS, which reached
its design output-10 million kit—and is now the largest ABS in the USSR. New turbo-
generators were commissioned at the Sayano-Shushenskaya CBS and at the Cheboksarskaya,
Nizhne-Kamskaya, Kurpsaysltaya and other hydroelectric stations.

The following were introduced at thermal electric-power stations: two 500-“ power
units at the Ekibastuz GRBs-l and the first 3004!" power units at the Azerbaijan
GRES, the Zuyevskaya (IRES-2 and at other 6328's and TETs's.

The installed capacity of electric-power stations at the end of 1981 exceeded 277
million k". of which more than 232 million It" (810 percent of total installed capa-
city at electric-power stations) was incorporated into the USSR's thified Power
System. The production of electric power by these stations amomted to about 1.175
-billion mm (88.3 percent of the country's total output).

The extent of new transmission lines of 35-“! capacity and greater was increased
by almost 25,000 km and reached 793,000 km.

Great new tasks in the development of our country's economy have been set for 1982-
the second year of the llth Five-Year Plan. National revenues will increase by

2.6 percent in comparison with 1981. The volume of industrial production will

grow by 6.7 percent.

In accordance with the approved State plan for the economic and social development of
the USSR for 1982 and the recently adopted resolutions of the CPSU Central Co-ittee
and the USSR Council of Ministers on the economical expenditure of resources, the
production of electric and thermal power for 1982 has been set at 1.365 billion th
(based on the envisioned conservation of 68 billion kWh and 124 million Ccal in the
economy), and the output of thermal power from centralized sources will be

2,365 Goal. Of this, the electric—power stations of the USSR Minenergo will gener-
ate 1.259 billion kWh (92.2 percent) and 925 million Goal (39.1 percent).

The increase in the production of electric power in 1982 with respect to the volume
of production in 1981 will amount to 35 billion kWh, or 2.6 percent. This will

be insured through the generation of power at AES's and 638‘s. The absolute pro-
duction of electric power by thermal electric-power stations is being kept at the
1981 level and is envisioned on the order of 1,063 billion huh. The production

at nuclear power stations will be 107 billion kﬂ‘h (8 percent) and 195 billion ItHh
(14.6 percent) at hydroelectric plants.

'The increase in the output of thermal power will amount to 66 miliion gCal. or 3
percent. The utilization of secondary and low-grade discharge heat will increase
in I982 to 11.0 million Gcal (about 120 million Goal were utilized in 1981).

“WWW?
In 1982, as previously, the demand for electric power in agriculture and in municipal
economies will increase at a most rapid pace.

Out of 126 billion kUh to be used in agriculture, provisions have been made to expend
96 billion kWh on production needs. This will make it possible to increase to

4,250 kuh the electric power available to workers in agriculture. There will also

be an increase in the expenditure of electric energy for the municipal needs of

the village, which will amomt to more than 300 kWh per village inhabitant (a rise

of 6 percent). Provisions have been made to expand 970 km per urban resident in
1982. This figure includes an increase in interapartmsnt conauwtion to 365 kWh

(an increase of 3 percent).

The extent of electrification of the workers' labor in industry will increase by
2 percent in comparison with 1981.

In the country's eastern regions (to the east of the Urals), provisions have been
made to generate 390 billion kWh in 1982, as opposed to 375 billion in 1981. This
increase of lo percent will increase the eastern regions' share of production to

28.6 percent. The fastest rates of‘ increase in the production of electric power

in 1982 will come about due to the assimilation of capabilities introduced in 1981
and the introduction of others in 1982--in the Uzbek SSR (by 3.5 percent), in the
Kazakh $811 (by 12.6 percent), in the Azerbaijan 8311 (by 10 percent) and in the Kirghiz
SSR (by 3.6 percent).

An increase in capital investment (with expected iwlementatim in 1981) of 8 percent
and a 15 percent increase in the volume of construction and installation work is
provided for in the plan for capital construction in the electric-power industry

for 1982, drawn up on the basis of the primary directions for the development of

the industry resulting from the resolutions of the 26th CPSU Congress.

The amount of capacity to be comiasioned is determined on the basis of:
the assurance of the planned volume of energy;

the degree of construction readiness of power-production facilities by the end of
1981;

the creation of the necessary degree of readiness by the end of 1981, in particular,
for the introduction of not less than 5 million 1:11 at ABS's in 1983;

an increase in power-system reserve capacity in 1982 to 8.5-9.0 percent, and the
commissioning of 34,000 km of transmission lines rated at 35 kV and greater. This
will include more than 10,000 km from capital investment in the agricultural sector.
In this case, primary attention will be devoted to the counissioning of high-capacity
lines that insure the delivery of power from electric-power stations and increase

the reliability of power-system operation.

Based on the execution of the above-mentioned tasks, the conniseioning of capacities
throughout the country on the whole will amomt to 8.5 million kﬂ, including 8.1
million k" throughout the USSR Minenergo.
