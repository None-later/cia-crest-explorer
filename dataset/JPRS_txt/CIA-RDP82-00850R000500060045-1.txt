[Article by Philippe Durupt: "The 150 Largest Taxpayers"!

[Text] For the last 18 months French business has been
involved in a new crisis. Our clataification measures
how they overcame the previous one. It gives a good
idea of their ability to adapt.

This third honor roll of the 150 largest taxpayers in industry and trade is
a good vintage. 0n the whole, the taxes paid are up considerably.

The reason is that the 3-year average which is used to calcualte the results
no longer includes 1977, which was a wretched year. (The amount of tax firms
paid increased only 6.5 percent, less than the inflation rate.)

This average does include, however, the figures from 1980. which were excel-
lent when judged by the increase of taxes on profits (plus 26 percent).

It was. therefore, a year of recovery. but not for all companies and not to
the same degree. The classification is still changing.

This surprises no one for the automobile firms because their activity is highly
cyclical. More unexpected among the leaders is Din-France's gain of one place
with a worse performance than the year before. Air Liquide has stayed in lath
place, and the CGF. [French General Electric Company] has only advanced one,
despite a large increase (more than 30 percent) in their taxes.

The variations are decreasing: competition for the first palces is fiercer
than ever.

Bongrain went from 83rd to 107th place because of a well supervised internal
development. Creuaot—Loire moved up 35 places—the beginning of a recovery
which within a few years should result in a place which is more in line with
the size of its turnover.

The most favorable changes seen last year are continuing--unrestrictedly in

the food industry, but with more subtlety in electronics. Construction and
public works are more complex.

FOR OFﬂCIAL USE ONLY

Exclusively French businesses have advanced in the classification, a temporary
phenomenon which was interrupted in 1981 with the real estate crisis.

The large public works firms, who left to conquer foreign markets, have slid.
But here is a case (the only one of this size) where the tax criterion is mis-
leading. The major public works firms are making large profits on their foreign
projects in countries where they are not heavily taxed. Their total net profits
are thus quite higher than their taxes, almost 3 times as much in the case of
Bouygucs. The years 1978 and 1980 are a transition period, since the conse-
quences of the second oil shock had not begun to be felt until the second
quarter of 1980. This is also due to the European Monetary System, which was
implemented in April 1979; its effects are still feveloping.

This produced a scissors effect for French industiral firms, attacked on their

own territory by German competition and hurt badly in exports on European
markets.

Two types of firms have escaped from the smothering effect of the European
Monetary System: those who export to the dollar zone (public works in the
Middle East, arms suppliers, etc.) and the major distribution firms.

The instability of the situation has only increased since the change of govern-
' meat and politics in France, the effects of the second oil shock followed by
the slump in prices on world markets, and the prolonged worldwide recession.

The guarantee of past profits has never been so necessary to get through this
period.

[Article by Alain Hargaron: "The Taxpayers' Honor Roll"]

[Text] An exclusive DAFSA [Financial Documentation and
Analysis Company Ltd]-VALEURS ACTUELLES classification:
firms' performance measured according to the most precise
criterion--taxes paid. At the head of the list are the
new nationalized firms. But the champions of social
efficiency. under private management, have gained some
points.

The two 011 companies are still at the top of the list by a large margin.
lMB—France is in 3rd place now (it was 4th in 1981), followed by Renault,
which doubled its taxes and went from 12th to 4th place. On the other hand,
Peugeot. 3d last year, lost 6 places and is now only 9th. Four of the five
nationalized industrial firms are in the top ten. A nice private-management
inheritance for the directors appointed by the state.

The year 1980 was good for French firms. This third classification of the
largest taxpayers in industry and trade, calculated over 3 fiscal years to
compensate for abnormal variations, shows a strong increase in the bottom-
linc figure.

Last year. the firm classified 150th, Vitos (textile. knit goods) payed only
7.76 million francs in taxes. This year, number 150 is Ruche Heridionale,
which paid 15.84 million.

Another example is Hajorette, the star of the Lyon stock exchange. Its price
has more than doubled in a year and its average tax has increased by 30 percent,
reaching 11.80 million francea, but that does not put it any higher than 180th
place; it has disappeared from our honor roll. The same is true for a lot of
others, notably Skis Rossignol, in the red for 1980 (fiscal year ending 31
March 1981); its average tax is no more than 14.3 million.

The year 1980 was also a year of transition. The effects of the first oil
shock had softened; those of the second (a new price increase and~the soaring
dollar) had not yet been felt.

The results of 1981 will certainly give our next classification a less brilliant
shine. But taxes might decrease less than the actual rate of return. A lot of
firms have, in fact, interrupted their investment programs. The immediate

effect of this interruption is the following: their tax base could be increased

because they have eliminated opportunities for accelerated depreciation and tax
deductions for investments.

The new nationalized firms are for the most part at the top of our classifica-
tion.

The exceptions are CIT-Honeywell Bull, which is 27th (like last year), and
especially the two steel giants, who do not appear at all.

The explanation is very simple: their actual annual average losses since 1975
are close to 2 billion francs for each of them. These losses even reached 3
billion in 1981. Despite all the reorganization measures already taken, there
still exist sizable surplus production capacities which will require the new
managers to choose between certain installations in the North and in Lorraine.

According to the criterion of turnover, the new nationalised firms would be
classified much better than they are here. But their average net margin
measured by the relation between the tax on the firms and the turnover (about
2.4 percent) is almost 2 times lower than that of the firms in our classifica-
tion that have remained private (their net margin exceeds 4 percent). Note
especially in the case of IBM-France.

There is one reason for this: the newly nationalized firms are much more
involved in heavy industry where fixed expenses are very high. Thus, any .
reduction in turnover due to particularly stiff competition affects the profit
margin.

It will be interesting to notice over the next few years how the differences in
the rates of return change--will they tend to increase or to decrease?

The state has taken control of Marcel Dassault Airplanes (17th place, 3.5
percent net margin) and of Hatra (23rd place, 5 percent net margin). These
two firms work in advanced technology sectors. They have been managed by
their president-founders, the second until recently while the first still is.

Two already nationalized firms are part of this classification: Renault in
4th place and SNECHA [National Aircraft Engine Study and Manufacturing Company]
in 84th. The talbe comparing the situation of Renault and Peugeot shows that
until 1975, state-managed Renault did not pay one franc in taxes.

A specialist in the production of both military and civilian airplane engines,
SNECHA, which has a new president (Rene Ravaud passed his responsibility to
Jacques Benichou, until then president of Messier-Bispano), has launched a
sizable program of jet engine manufacturing in conjunction with the 0.8.
General Electric firm. The market for this type of engine is estimated at
some 5,000 units.

The National Industrial Aerospace Company (SNIAS) has not yet been classified.
It balanced its operating account for the first time in 1979, when it had a
profit of 8 million francs. In 1980 its net profit exceeded 120 million. But
because of its past losses it is still not paying any taxes. The very distinct
turnaround in its management was accomplished under the direction of General
Mitterrand, whose mandate was recently extended.

The figures for the other nationalized firms are.either too weak or in the red,
which is the case of Air France, or are even exempt from tax, like EDP [French
Electric Company].

The company Air-Inter, with shares held by Air-France (25 percent), the SNCF
[French National Railroad Company] (25 percent) and UTA [Air Transport Union]
(15 percent). as well as several institutions, is well placed (43rd). Its
entry into the stock market is still being delayed. This airline company,
which showed a large profit in 1981, recently announced that its accounts will
probably just break even in 1982.

Finally. the state controls the two large French oil firms, CF? [French
Petroleum Company] and Elf, as well as the Haves agency (56th) in the communi-
cation and advertising sector. Its principal subsidiary, Eurocom, the number
one European network of advertising agencies, recently merged with the Goulet
company. This has expanded its activities and put it on the stock exchange.

The private sector remains quite vigorous. Among the first 50 companies in
this category there are several whose shares are still predominantly family
owned. They are, in order: Peugeot, Michelin, L'Oreal, Pernod-Ricard, Casino,
Auchan, Bic, General Occidental, Hoet-Hennessy and Legrand.

Here in particular are three new names that have come out of anonymity up0n
their recent entry into the stock market and which appear in this honor roll:

--The General Geophysical Company (39th) has become one of the companies with
the highest capitals on the Paris stock exchange. A specialist in seismic
underground studies for petroleum research, its stockholders include Elf, the
financial section of Paribas, and CFP.

--Ceneral Biscuit (79th) which was formed from the merger of several family
companies. in third place worldwide in its field, it has undertaken a large
scale reorganization and internationalization effort.

—-Novotel (124th). which was introduced into the unofficial market in 1981,
was able in a few years to increase its hotels by adding the Hercure chain
to its own, as well as the Courte-Paille restaurants along highways and the

1.

FOR OFFNJAI.USE1DNLJ'

luxury Sofitel chain acquired from Jacques Borel International. Novotel is
directed by its founders. Paul Dubrule and Gerard Pelisson (who, in addition,
was also given the presidency of what remains of Jacques Borel International).

The entry onto the stock market of Cap-Gemini-Sogeti (135th) (a data process-
ing services company) has also been awaited for some time, but this has been
put off until later. This was an unexpected result of the tax on wealth.

Its president, Serge Kampf, owner of about 50 percent of the capital, seems to
fear an excessive hike on the stock exchange, which would bring the basis for
the tax on wealth above the possibilities of deductions for investments. This
was a disappointment for the Credit Lyonnais which had taken a 15 percent share
in the company while thinking it would go public.

Some of the newcomers in our classification that should be pointed out are
Esso-Chimie (28th), a subsidiary, like its sister firm Ease, of the American
firm Exxon; Lesieur (38th), making a spectacular recovery since 1979; Babcock-
Fives-Lille (hlst), one of the large French companies in heavy equipment and
factory installations, which has also improved dramatically; and Prouvost, in
textile (120th).

The oil firms are still in the first two places, but for how long? After a
new increase in 1980, oil prices are collapsing on world markets. This is good
for consumers, but is liable to be costly to the firms. The oil which they
must buy because of long-term contracts concluded between states, added to

that which they extract themselves, leaves them with enormous surpluses which
they are selling at a loss.

The drilling sector, in which Elf is deeply involved, especially in the North
Sea, must have high sales prices in order to be profitable. Refining, the
major activity of the French Petroleum Company (the French Refining Company,
its subsidiary, accounts for half of the French market) is affected by a
crisis which is even more severe than that of the iron and steel industry.

The sector's 1981 deficit is estimated at 13 billion francs. The reasons:
sizable surplus production capacity, increasing indebtedness for financing
their stocks, and a price system which prevents them from passing on increases
in crude oil or the dollar. Enormous investments for conversion are needed.

Most refining companies, with the notable exception of Esso (16th place),
make too many heavy products such as fuel oil and not enough light ones like
gasorihe. The state is currently working on a recovery plan.

As in our previous classifications, the first place of CF? can be explained
because its accounting methods are different than those of Elf-Aquitaine.

The CFP, in effect, classifies the enormous royalties paid to producer
countries as a tax on the companies. It should be noted, however, that

CFP's taxes are increasing two times less rapidly than Elf-Aquitaine's when
compared to our last classification.

A remarkable performance was given by Burafrep, which went from 73rd to 44th
place. This oil research and development company has several institutions
among its stockholders, notably Lazard and DA? [expansion unknown].

For the first time. the Renault-Peugeot duel is going in Renault's favor.
Renault is first in sales volume and surpasses Peugeot in terms of profit-
ability. This is a spectacular reversal--whereas Renault paid practically
no taxes from 1970 to 1975 its competitor paid 1.2 billion francs.

The nationalized firm is benefiting from the huge success of the R5. Peugeot's
deteriorating results, however. can be expalined by a policy of foreign growth
which was too rapid these last few years. The absorption of Citroen, which
took place before the oil crisis. went rather well. However, that of Talbot-
Chrysler is making a big dent in the accounts-the firm is having serious
difficulties in Great Britain and Argentina. The deterioration in its con-
solidated financial statement increased again in 1981.

The automobile crisis has not spared Michelin, which has gone from 8th place
in our last honor roll (with a tax of 675 million) to 11th (389 million).

There were two advances in the data processing sector, that of IND-France,
which has already been noted, counteracted by results which are in a 10
percent decline. There was also CIT-Honeywell Bull, which, in order to keep
its 27th place in the classification, declared 150 million francs in taxes
this year vs. 128 million last year. But it was a fragile advance: the
company has already announced 630 million francs in losses for fiscal year
1981. IBM, on the other hand, has continued to win market shares.

The major stockholder of CII-HB, the nationalized Saint-Cobain Pont-a-Mousson,
should give up on data processing. Hill CII-HB become independent again or
will it join up with another French company with activities similar to its
own? Several discussions are being held at once--with its American stock-
holder Honeywell, which has decided to cut back its participation in the
capital from 47 to 19 percent, and with Thomson which was holding talks with
an American mini-computer company. The administration asked it to study the
possibility of marketing. and even producing, CII-Honeywell Bull's range of
mini-computers (the mini—6's).

Food and distribution companies have all made definite progress. They con-
tinued to do well in 1981 and at the beginning of 1982. The present policy
of recovery through consumption is helping them. There have been a few re-
groupings: Docks de France, Ruche Picarde and Cofradet merged in 1980, and
the Revi110n investment company has recently turned towards distribution by
taking over more than 33 percent of Radar.

The food industry, which has been classified as a priority sector, has
benefited from financing at guaranteed rates. The firms with large-scale
operations in the United States (Moet-Hennessy and Perrier, especially) have
taken advantage of the dollars' increase for the last 12 months.

There has again been an improvement in construction and public works. Maison
Phenix. Cimcnts Francais, Screg, Spie-Batignolles, and Porcher (plumbing)

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

have improved their financial statements. The first-place firm directly in-
volved in this sector, Lafarge-Coppee, has essentially kept its place (18th
instead of 17th) by paying 40 million more in taxes-266 million vs. 226 last
year. It should also be noted that Sias was absorbed by Lafarge in 1981.

In 1981 those firms from among these which concentrated their operations

on construction in France, primarily Haisona Phenix and the firm Maison
Familiale (they are in 3hth and 35th place), suffered from the housing slump
which is itself linked to the very high cost of credit. In particular, the
temporary work company Ecco gave up its diversification in private housing.

The firms Auxiliaire d'Entreprises and Bouygues continue to ring up very
large profits for their sites abroad while profiting (especially Bouygues)
form the crisis in France to increase their shares of the market.

The success of French firms in public telephOny does not show up in our classi-
fication. CIT-Alcatel, which has given its German competitor Siemens a lot

of trouble by putting heavy stakes on so-called temporal technology before it
did. has not been calculated separately because it is over 50 percent a sub—
sidiary of C68. The company SAT [expansion unknown] of the 3S firm has gone
from 66th to 114th place because it is too small and entered the market too
late.

A firm which in our last classification was in 95th place, Metallic Con-
structions of Provence, began proceedings for "temporary suspension of activ-
ities" in October 1980. It has since been dismantled, and Chicago Bridge has
taken some of its assets and business.

This honor roll has been drawn up as in years past with the assistance of
DAFSA on the basis of Selectval's data bank. Its sample includes almost all
the firms quoted on the stock market. Most of then now publish rather precise

consolidated accounts (statements for the entire firm). For the others we

have chosen the accounts of the parent company as long as it has a direct
industrial or sales activity. Financial holdings are excluded. Their tax is

not significant; most is paid by their subsidiaries.

ECONOMIC FRANCE

EFFECTS OF FOREIGN DEFICIT, PRIVATE FIRMS 0R W's POLICIES
Paris L'EXPRBSS in French 19-25 Mar 82 pp 75~77
[Article by Jean Gloaguen: "warning—Slippery")

[Excerpts] The warning lights are on--the government
should soon reconcile the generosity of its ideas with
the available seans.

The government has changed its tone 0n econaaic affairs. This is not the
effect of the first round of cantonal elections, but of the first budget
discussions. Reassuring statements and speeches about respecting premises
have been succeeded by praise of strictness. The management makes a joke of
the electoral programs.

Since Hay 1981 the econosdc debate has been a sham, used for exclusively
political ends by a Left worried about cosbating the relative skepticism over
its management abilities and an opposition which had to use any means at its
disposal. In the end, there was a real cacophony: on nationalizations, on
the tax on wealth, on social security financing, on energy (nuclear and
natural gas) and on agricultural policy, the ministers blithely contradicted
each other. In the end they gaVe the impression that the government had not
act a clear economic policy. In addition, the misunderstanding among employ-
ers, professionals and farmers--groups which were already hesitant about the
"change"—--had been aggravated.

The authorities were liable to lose their credibility at this gas sooner or
later. The economic machine cannot run with just civil servants and arms fac-
tories. 0n Hednesday, 10 March, Francois Hitterrand took advantage of the
goverrsnent's preliminary work on the 1983 budget and of the communique written
by Pierre Hauroy to make a call to order. "01d expenditures will be reexam-
ined. even reconsidered, and new expenditures will -be chosen very strictly."

Doubtless, purely political considerations were not alien -to this warning: the
these of a balanced budget has always pleased in this country and, in any
case, there was some urgency. Had it not been said that the deficit in public
finances was reaching sizable proportions? Some 200 billion of the requests
from all the ministries were taken into account. Besides, it was not a bad
idea for the president of the Republic to appear worried about austerity and
orthodoxy 3 days before neeting Ronald Reagan.

No matter--the intervention of Francois Mitterrand is the result of real con-
cern. With its solo recovery, France is haunted by two dangers: a serious
decline in foreign exchange and an enormous ballooning of the deficit. Some
people are already waving scarecrows, talking of chain reaction devaluations
and runaway inflation. A situation which, slowly but surely, will drive the
French economy out of the international scene, will lead to protectionism and
will cause purchasing power to fall. A gradual decline.

The theme of decline is not new. It was talked about during Valery Giscard
d'Estaing's term, and not just by the Left. Beyond considerations on the fate
of rural Albania in 1925 or on the return of the candle, beyond sociological
and political convictions which find this a fertile theme, the real question
is this: Will the French still be willing to give a good pull during the next
decade? Can the goverment make a mixed economy work without a mini-um of
good will from the private sector? Can it convince those who are backing it
that the free lunch has been put off until later because of the crisis?
Medium- and long-term ecoaonic development depend on the answers to these
questions.

in the short term the analysis is simpler. The Left has avoided making any
big mistakes in 1981 and, even if clouds gather, there seem to be no indica-
tion of anything dramatic happening during the next few months.

Delors' Double or Nothing

The Socialist Party would like an exercise in high Jumping: a reduction in un-
employment without upsetting themajor monetary and foreign balances, and a
slowing of the hike in prices with, as a premium, a redistribution of income.
During the good days of more than 5 percent growth a year such goals were not
compatible. However, since the first oil crisis and the autonisation of pro-
duction tools it is a different story, as shown by the inescapable increase in
unemployment in most major Western countries.

These Western countries quite unanimously think that their competitiveness in
the eighties lies in a cure to inflation, through severe restriction of the
money supply. public expenditures and the foreign debt. These choices are
based on the thesis that employment comes only as the result of a "good
economy."

Ever since his arrival at the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Jacques Delors
has claimed that a decrease in unemployment and the lowering of prices could
go hand in hand. He bet the recovery of the French economy on this. During
the first stage the PLIII‘p would be primed by increasing low salaries and family
allowances, an increase which is included in the Left's program. Investment
and recovery on the foreign market should eventually take over from domestic
consumption to keep up the economic rhythm. This working hypothesis has led a
number of specialists to fear the worst and to say so.

The figures for 1981 show that those who announced catastrophes were wrong.

The results would hardly have been any different if Valery Giscard d'Bataing
had been relected.

At this point it is hard to see how France can follow its course for long
alone. Increasing budgetary expenditures will certainly support consumption.
But. to a great extent, this consumption will benefit foreign competitors

who will have the advantage of more stable production h.sts. The example of
vehicle registrations in February leaves hardly any illusions-~more than 25
percent were foreign automobiles. It is not surprising that unemployment
figures continue to climb under th:ae conditions.

It is notsurprising either that firms are protesting their increase in costs
linked to the reduction in the workweek and that they fear they will again be
called upon to contribute in order to balance the budgets of UNEDIC [National
Union for Employment in Industry and Commerce] and of Social Security.

And it is not surprising that rumors of a devaluation of the franc have
started again. Unless sales increase, the trade deficit cannot help but swell
considerably. The figure of a 100~billion-franc deficit has been heard; that
would be double last year's.

or course, the small foreign debt left by Raymond Barre gives his successors
the possibility of finding financing on the international market. The advis-
ability of such an approach, however, is highly questionable: it would, most
especially. mean mortgaging the future in order to allow the French to come
sume more. It would also indicate a tendency toward the easy solution which
would mean pressure on the franc.

This pressure is all theanre dangerous because the money supply is also likely
to be called upon to finance the public deficit. In September 1981, Laurent
Fabius, minister of the budget, presented a budget with expenditures up 26
percent and a deficit of 94 billion francs for 1982. A few days later, after
the devaluation. the deficit dropped to 80 billion. Since then, it has not
stopped growing; latest estimates place it between 110 and 120 billion francs.
One discovers that hiring civil servants is not paid for just in salaries

and additional pencil sharpeners. One discovers that Algerian natural gas,
nutionalizations and the textile plan are expensive.

The change in prices will depend on foreign and domestic imbalances. Delora'
procedure for freezing salaries, based on the expectation that prices will go
down, assumes, by definition, that prices will not climb upward. One under-
stands the tenacity of the minister of economy and finance in preaching
austerity.

An economy's orientation is a function of its environment. In the euphoria

of victory the Socialists thought they had a large margin for maneuvering.
After testing the facts they have learned that France cannot play alone against
everybody else forever.

Their economic specialists are now thoroughly convinced. The question, however,
is whether or not these specialists have succeeded in persuading the Elysee
that there are no miracles.

INDUSTRY MINISTER GIVES GLOOMY VIE“ OF ECONOMY

Milan CORRIBRB DELLA SBRA in Italian 13 Apr 82 p 13

[Interview with Minister of Industry Giovanni Marcora by Perruccio de Bortoli;
date and place not given: "Harcora: 'Unjustiiied Optimists; the Italian Malady
Is Still Serious'"]

[Text] There is a recurrence of the economic emergency, with
liabilities of almost 3 billion in February's balance of
trade.

According to the minister of industry, the "hole" is the
result of the payment of overdue bills and the replacement

of supplies.
"Beware of the resumption of inflation in September."

The crux of the energy problem: "An agreement with Algiers is
necessary; but who will assume the increased burden must be
made clear."

Russian gas pipeline polemics with Longo.

A bad surprise. from the celebration of one Eastern to another. February's
balance of trade showed the negative increase of 2,931 billion, of 65, over
the monthly level of last Hay. Imports amounted to 10,516 billion (+41 percent
compared with February 1981); exports amounted to 7.585 billion (+28.l percent).

Striking figures. taken from Spadolini's television message which advised one
not "to let one's guard down" during the economic emergency. The weakness of
the lira (Friday the dollar equalled 1,329.75) seems confirmed by an increase in
expectations of a devaluation. And yet there is a ray of optimism. The 1860
[Institute for the Study of Economic Trends] - Bconomic world leans slightly
toward revival. But how does one find one's bearings amid apparently contra-
dictory indications? This is what Ministry of Industry Giovanni Harcore thinks.

[Question] "How is one to interpret this macroscopic "hole" in the balance of
trade?"

[Answer] "The situation has always been dramatic. Ever since I became minis-
ter I have continued to say the same things. But every once in a while some

isportant person says: ‘Everything is fine; the fight against inflation has
been won.’ But no. In February overdue bills had to be paid. The prior deposit
(abolished on 8 February: editor's note) had been r-sved and it was to be
expected..."

[Question] "But this, too, is-oot a positive smton. Kore purchases of raw
materials; more faith in the resumption of productivity?"

[Answer] "Let us look at the variation in supplies. In 1980 caspared with

1979, their value increased 16,659 billion. In 1981, conpared with the preceding
year, it decreased 3,700 billion. Because of loan difficulties,.and a certain
stability in the price of raw materials, fir-s cut down a: supplies. And it was
clear that, upon resusption of their replacement, there would be a negative
impact on the balance of trade. And then there are other factors: the aspects-
tion of an international recovery causes one to think that there night he a rise
in the cost of raw materials. If, then. there are problas of devaluation—we
hope that there will not be any—there will be a greater tendency to sake pur-
chases sooner."

[Question] "Is re-introduction of the prior deposit possible?"

[Answer] "I do not think so. Also because the EEC [European Economic Calamity]
probably would not accept this."

[Question] "Well, then?"

[Answer] "He have to reduce the treasury withdrawal on the financial market.
They say $0.000 billion. I don't think so. There are more. And the receipts
are less than estimated. With readjustnsnts in the financial law, then, new
burdens have emerged. And who is to cover them? The chief sin is that of
avoiding a considerable resumption of inflation in the fall."

[Question] "But there has been some success, even if there is still a struc-
tural inflation."

[Answer] Yes. We have reduced it; but less than the Federal Republic of
Germany. The differential is what counts. Saturday night the president of the
council dranatized the situation for the thousanth tine. But why did he say
that there had been sons success with respect to inflation? It is not true.
There is no change in the formula: taxes, more work, sacrifices. There is
nothing to be done."

[Question] "So, circumstances have not changed. Has there been no progress,
even from the attsapts at containment of the cost of labor?"

[Answer] "The only result of this long, enervating negotiation with the labor
unions was the postpone-ant of the negotiations on contracts. which now are
exploding. And then there is the big sword of Danoclss regarding liquidations.
No one knows how that will turn out."

[Question] The question of energy, augmented by the revaluation of the dollar,
has been a determinant factor in the deficit of the balance of trade, which

in the first 2 months was 4,567 billion (3.025 in the corresponding 2 months
of 1981). The matter of making purchases at better prices is being proposed
again. Is there a near-at-hand agreement with Algeria for gas?"

[Answer] "If we were to purchase natural gas from the Algerians at the present
price. the added burden would be 600-800 billion. It is clear that sooner or
later there will have to be an agreement. But if we have to pay more than the
market price to Algeria because of a broader agreement regarding cooperation,
it will be necessary to establish who will pay the 300-400 billion difference,
or whatever it will be. There are twOpossibilities. Either the treasury will
pay the sum to ENI [National Hydrocarbons Agency], in order to balance the
accounts again; or the rates will increase. But it will not be like when a
person who does not have shoes goes to the shoaaker and says to him: I need
some shoes and I can buy them only from you. If there had not been that national
bla bla. the agreement would already have been reached. I am ready for a poli-
tical agreement with Algeria, but I must be told who will pay the difference
between the market price and what Algiers wants. Because then, as chairman of
the CIP [Interministerial Price Comittee]. I will be the one who will have to
increase the rates."

[Question] "And what about the Russian gas pipeline?

[Answer] "This is our situation. It seems that Socialdemocratic Secretary
Longo says that we cannot finance Soviet armament. But this past 18 November
the minister of foreign trade already signed an authorization for a 2,000 billion
loan to the Nuovo Pignone Company and to other Italian companies interested in
the construction of the gas pipeline. Longo should not turn to me. but should
ask the minister of foreign trade to revoke the funds. If we do not purchase
Soviet gas, we will cut ourselves off. to the complete advantage of Germany and
France. Because the gas pipeline will be constructed. Certainly bongo will not
be able to stop it. We are already consming 7 billion cubic meters a year of
Russian natural gas; we will use 14. And we would depend on Moscow for only

3 percent of our energy needs. But that's not the question: it is the diversi-
fication of supplies that will assure us that we will not be subject to possible
closings of this or that gas tap. And this is stated in the National Energy
Plan.passed by both the socialists and the aocialdemocrats."

VAN THIJN ON LABOR Pm, (”W DIMCULTIBS
Alasterdala VRIJ NEDERLAND in Dutch 3 Apr 82 pp 3, It

(Report of an interview of Eduard Van Thijn, ninister of internal affairs, by
J. Van ‘rijn and Max Van Heerel: "Ed Van Thijn: ‘1 Peer That the Party's
Tendency To Take Beads Will Not Be Suppressed Everywhere Bffectively'"]

[Excerpts] Why did he, as an opponent of Van Agt, bring
this cabinet about? why did he consider that Joop Den Uyl
must also becom ninister of employ-ant? why was the
struggle for the chairmanship so disastrous? Why did the
prime ninister leave his cabinet in the lurch, and how did
that feel? And what nust the party do with the people who want
to take up the arguaents of the opponents, the New Realista?
Is the PvdA program after 'Veerwerk" [Back to Work] to be
"Hegwerp" [Throwaway]? Hhile the calls to arms are being
sounded in the streets of Austerdua and ailversua: the
opinion of an insider.

[Van Thijn] "You will just have to begin by writing that I make such a
belligerent inpresaion. When I read the interviews. I can see that seals to
be nandatory. In reality, I an thoroughly sick of it."

The sinister is dressed in brown: brown tromers, brown shoes, brown jersey.
He pours coffee into Ajax cups—”That will get your spirits up, but I had all
I wanted while you were studing around downstairs." On a side table there
are frued clippings fron the last cabinet fornation, in which the current
ninister of internal affairs piloted his party into the goverment. The
clippings are bound in a yellow copper frane with the inscription: "Hope
nay ebb, Courage Never," a thought that sons to be very such in style a few
days after the provincial elections. The originator of the present was
hilou Van Den, the wife of the ninister of housing, who found it in the dark
street of Jan Nagels Haagse Bluf the evening before this interview took place.
"1 was very pleased to get it," says Bd Van Thijn, ”but perhaps now they will
want it back." He takes a cigar from a gigantic box of Balnoral. Next to
the box, there is a vase with white roses and enowdrops, and a yellow tin box
of chocolate covered candies.

[Question] "hat did Ed Van ‘l'hijn really think about the study in Hugse
Bluf that showed that Andre Van Der Low, close friend of the final editor and

Marcel Van Dan, was appraised higher by those who did not vote fro. the WM
than Joop Den Uyl, no friend of the final editor?

Van Thijn, still rambling: "0h, as a piece .of journalism it was good, but it
seemed to me to be more of a thing for TROS I‘l‘elevision Radio Broadcasting
Foundation], AVRO [General Broadcasting Association], VERONICA, or what not.
I find the whole discussion rather objectionable at this tine."

[Question] But the discussion is not unexpected, is it?

Van Thijn answers: "0h, its sinnering some, anoldering like a fire in a pest
bog. But that is not how you do those things, not at all. The last thing
the Labor Party can use right now is a discussion of the succession. Den Uyl
is still the spearhead, and if this question ever comes up on the agenda,
that cannot be as the result of a kind of popularity poll. There will have
to be a considered decision, in which more factors will have to be involved
than Haurice De Hond's botanical sample box. Let us learn a lesson from the
chair-anship battle between Hex Van Den Berg and "in Meijer. ‘l‘hat caused
trenendous denage to the Lbor Party. If you follow the electoral develop-
nents, that battle for the chairmanship was the beginning of the decline. No
matter who wins, after an internal coapetition of 3 months, soneone has become
unsuitable to act as a binding figure, by definition. We are not an American
party with prinaries. Cutthroat conpetition does not fit into the party
culture of the Labor Party."

[Question] What requirements will a new standard bearer have to nest?

[Answer] "In the first place, he nust have charisna. By that I do not mean
someone without warts, but soneone who radiates war-th, who can inspire people
and who is up to the deadly rays of television spotlights. Further, he nust
be someone who has vision, someone who is the same all the time. Not someone
who turns the page over in a book and says: 'I have a vision.’ Not someone
who says: 'According to the public opinion figures, chapter three will not do
any more, now it is time for chapter four.‘ And it lust be soneone who is
unifying, someone who does not belong to one wing of the party, somne who
stands in the heart of the party and seasons who has the courage to give
leadership." Laughs. "That last, in particular, is obviously a new danand
since the. provincial elections."

[Question] In an interview with Puchinger (CHRIST!!! DmOCRATISCIE
VERKENNINGBN, October 1981), you expressed yourself as being satisfied as the
former coalition negotiator with the seats the Labor Party had pulled in. Now,
6 months later, Den Uyl is being attacked fron all sides as the minister of
social affairs and employment: from the labor lovelent because of the Health
Insurance Act, and by others because his employment progrn would not produce
any employment. We have the impression—and we had it at the time--that the
CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] had just distributed the departments the
way, in fact, that they saddled the W!) with the rotten departnents during
the first Van Agt cabinet. Has the PvdA [Labor Party] been painted into a
corner by the (IDA?

[Answer] “No, not at all. He were not painted into a corner. Really, we
fought it very hard. The only variant that night have been worked out--I saw

it as worse, there were others who thought it would have been better-would
have been to have Den Uyl in finances. But just inagine how it would have

19

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
looked if a CDA minister of social affairs had carried out the health
Insurance Act operation at the urging of the socialist Hinister of Finances
Joop Den Uyl. would Den Uyl's political prospects have been any better? I
know Den Uyl as a dedicated technician, who would have been a right-thinking
finance minister. But I remembered the Vondeling story all too well. I was
not too opposed to Den Uyl as finance minister. Den Uyl himself had his own
ideas about that. I saw much more in Den Dyl as the sinister of social
affairs and employment, particularly in employment, in that connection. I
was counting a little bit on Den Dyl enjoying the benefit of the doubt from
the labor movement, but I was wrong there. Well, it did not turn out that
way. To get back to your question, if you look at the functioning of this
cabinet, you cannot accuse our people of any lack of quality. We have the

best people, sorry that I have to say it, in the areas best suited to them.
The whole story of, 'you were roped into it,’ I can assure you, and I carried
out the negotiations: in private there was a war of attrition."

Bazooka

[Question] And 6 months after that war of attrition, then, the PvdA suffers
a big defeat and the polarization with the labor movement is almost complete.

Van Thijn, now suppressing anger: 'ﬁhe labor movement carries a heavy respon-
sibility for the creation of this cabinet. Groenevelt was the first one who
pled for the formation of this cabinet, who did not want a leftist majority
cabinet. The labor movement felt that it must not fall out over personalities.
By that they meant the person of Van Agt. This cabinet must come to be,
otherwise the labor movement would flounder. In part because of that pressure,
we joined in the government. It is really crazy, then, that after the first
and best measure that we have undertaken, they have unlimbered their biggest

gun. I could have understood it if they had started out with foils, but they
grabbed for the bazooka right away. The tragedy of the situation was the
Labor Party's tragedy. why had Den Dyl been so pepular? Because he was the
personification of the PvdA which stood up for the little man. And now sud-
denly they saw the reverse. That was a shock, a cultural shock. The image
was called up that now he wanted to attack the little man. And that is not

true, that is not true. I find it shameful of people who bear responsibility
on the left, even from the leaders of trade unions. The cries of 'the

minister of a-sociel affairs' and 'hang Joop from the highest tree': such
demagoguery must not be tolerated."

[Question] The PvdA did not guage the labor movement's reactions right.

[Answer] It is all because the Labor Party has not had the space as yet to
pursue a policy which is recognizable to the labor movement, and to carry
out the cure of the welfare state in harmony with the labor movement. The
image of Kok against Den Uyl is even less credible than that of Den Uyl next
to Van Agt.”

[Question] But the problem is that there has not even been the start of a

comprehensive policy. Shell and the medical specialists may do as they
please, but the vulnerable are attacked. by a cabinet including the Labor

Party.

av“ v..----.— var- area-o

[Answer] "We are still faced with the inheritance from the first Van Agt
cabinet. That cabinet's mistake was that each time, it picked out one group.
If you ask Netherlanders whether they want alterations to he made, in the
abstract they all say yes-—and they all vote for the ones that call for that
the loudest-but it stops when you start with them. The most miserable thing
that I have ever seen was that colunn of 10,000 motorcyclists. I did not
even know that we had done anything to them. He had barely put a finger on'
their valvestems before they rode to the Hague in a really unimaginable
column. That is what you get if you start to say: 'He will pick on this
group Monday and that group Tuesday....'"

[Question] And on Sunday on Shell.
[Answer] "Gentlemen do not work on Sunday."

[Question] Why should the Chi really still need the PvdA. after Hednesday's
[provincial government elections] results? Now they have their potential
alternative again. after all. And you people only want to cut back with all
kinds of conditions.

Van Thijn. emotionally: "They cannot get away with that. It is a three-
party cabinet. Surely, assuming that a rightist majority tries to have things
its own way. that can only be temporary. It is a question of the quality of
the form of government. There has not been an economic crisis that did not
see parliamentary denocracies fall. That is the lesson of the 1930's. The
point is not merely to solve the economic crisis; the point is to solve the
crisis and after that to be able to keep the constitution intact. All of
those people who took the day off Usdnesday [did not vote] form a disturbing

signal."
[Question] It was primarily PvdA voters who stayed away.

[Answer] "He made two mistakes. In 1981, we were hit hard because we had

sat in the corner the years before. and last week we were hit hard because

we were not recognizable. I think that is not fair. We have only been in

for a few months. But it was a signal that the PvdA can only continue to bear
some of the responsibility if we are allowed to remain recognizable to the
people whoa we represent. As long as it is just a question of power politics.
we had better get out."

[Question] But it is precisely a question of power politics. The CDA sub-
mitted to a government with the PvdA because the socialists were supposed to
be able to keep the labor mowenent under control. Now. that does not seem to
have been entirely successful. So what do they need with you any more?

[Answer] "If that is what they thought, than they were completely wrong, and
I could have told them that in advance. And in a certain sense, it is really
a very good thing that they made that mistake, for we are not here to keep

the labor movement under control. But if they were thinking in terms like
that. and if they are just talking about the budget deficit. now they can

just push us out. He will not allow our principles to be thrown on the trash-
heap.“

Intermediary

[Question] For an awful lot of people. the question now is just what the
principles of the PvdA are now. Cm you inagine that?

[Answer] "The PvdA is in a credibility crisis. First you had 1977: not
governing. That was a blow to our voters. On top of that cane the chair-
nanship crisis. Then a kind of coalition cabinet within the PvdA case into
being. Every position the PvdA published was the result of negotiations
between Den Uyl and Van Den Berg. even the election program. for example,
while we often knew perfectly well that no one believed in it."

[Question] Still. you can scarcely object to that: you were usually the
negotiator yourself. Or to put it better. the internediary.

Van Thijn, a bit abashed: "That is just ny way. I never believe in just one
truth."

[Question] As delegation chairman did you not have a whole year of the truth
at the tine? with the VAD [Excess Profits Sharing Bill] and the WIR [Lew

on Investnent Conputation] and the Law on Industrial Councils. and the land
policy and all of those glorious episodes of the recent socialist history?

Van Thijn is silent for a while, nunblee, "Mn-I," and says pensively: “You
will have a feather in your cap if you can report that now we are going to do
everything differently.

[Question] You must be talking now about that new realise of a nunber of
your prouinent party members.

[Answer] "I find that an unfortunate tern. It carries smething of the

sense of: 'We were wrong all along and now suddenly we are going to be
realistic.‘ And sons people got the idea: 'Until the provincial govern-ant
elections.‘ If you start adjusting your opinion to the public opinion figures,
that is not credible, but if you try to say, 'Our policy is good, but just
nisunderstood,’ then that too is not credible. You have to learn from set-
backs, you have to adjust. But not with a throw-sway attitude."

[Question] So now you already have the title of the next election progran.
Do you think these things up all the tine?

Van Thijn, laughing slowly and a bit red: "Yes, Throw Away '85."
Mighty Irritation
[Question] Back to the New Realise.

[Answer] what irritates es no end, is that yOu have one group in the party

who say that everything must stay the way it is, and you have another group
who say that we have been wrong about everything all along. let us just coopt

our opponents' argments. There is so much talk, I do not want to take part
in it. 1 do not want to just coopt my opponent's arguents for want of any-

thing better to do. It really got me upset when I heard it said in my group.
'the most important thing is to cover the budget deficit.”

[Question] Van Der Louw? Van Dam?

[Answer] "I am not talking about people. But how does the party react to an
election defeat like that? I can tell you that precisely. for l have been
there many times. You will have people who explain it out of the fact that
we have become unrecognizable. Thus. they say: 'We have to sing a tone
higher; we must become more socialist, more radical.‘ And you will have
people who feel that we were already too radical. They point out that the
NM must not alienate itself from reality: the moderate groups, the entre-
preneurs and whatever else counts as reality. I an already sick, weak and
miserable in advance about this repetitive break between the two-party
cultures. As a party. we have a grizzly's image. There are movements. but
certainly there have always been movements that want to get their own way to
the extreme. But you cannot make an alterantive out of an anthill. We under-
estimated the seriousness of the economic situation, that is true. We can
now see that seriousness before our eyes. But that cannot mean that we come
to see alterations as a goal in themselves, as some in our group have done.

I am certainly someone who goes a long way to reach a compromise. I also
believe in the necessity of remaining seated in the cabinet. But you must not
go so far that you really believe in your opponent's policies.

There is another danger: That comes about if you try to analyse why the PvdA
lost in the old sections of the big cities, last year to 0'66 [Democrats of
1966], this year to the WI) and in the 1960's to the Parmers' Party. How can
that be? So we say that our people are running to follow Hiegel. And then
you come to the area of the taboos: the misuse of the social security abuses,
the foreigners. Then I say, 'we are not just opinion followers. we are also
opinionated. So we will just become a smaller party. Sorry. We must not fall
into cliches and then say: 'we were not realistic enough, so we will adopt
our opponents' cliches.‘ For years we were criticized by economists who said:
'The party does not choose. You unset maintain Jan Hodaal's [the average
man's] buying power.‘ So we chose. But not even a year later, 6 months later
we were sitting around discussing whether the zero line could be maintained
for the people with a minimum income or a minimum wage. Then I too said.

'we have to hold on somewhere.‘ whom are we representing now as a socialist
party?

"that have you done to your identity if you cannot even guarantee the buying
power of the people on the bottom? I myself an mightily irritated by this
surrender by the party. I an a person who cue up through the party, who even
put his stamp on it. and that is true of many others who are now suddenly
calling that the party must do this. or that the party cadre must do that.
There is a certain tradition in our movusnt to believe that as soon as you
are called to a higher position, you know better than the party. I do not
accept that. I have trouble with speaking critically to the party. I feel

that it nay very well happen that a principle that you used to defend can no

23.

longer be maintained. That can occur. But then you have to consider your
own position. Then credibility may demand that you let someone also seek
other solutions. The ease with which the one people take up different

positions at a given moment naturally does the credibility of the PvdA no good."

[Question] Now you are talking about your party chair-an, your delegation
chairman end a nuber of ninisters.

[Answer] "Yes, that really is a probln.”
[Question] That seems to be the understatement of the century.
[Answer] "I find it to be a problem."

[Question] There is an image of the top of the PvdA as not being cohesive.
Those are the hard facts.

[Answer] "I think that in the beginning of this cabinet, that played a role,
but that was because we were all new at being ninisters. At first, everyone
was frightfully obsessed with his own angle, that was true from the beginning,
and also because the first thing that we had to do was to make up the new
budget. Almost of itself, that is a cutthroat battle. Then a cliaate was
really created of everyone having to justify himself. Therefore, not only
Den Uyl, but everyone came to be a little bit isolated. In that period,

every PvdA minister felt lonely. That was true for the new ministers, too.

He did not see soon enough that Dan Uyl, hm. was facing a much lore difficult
task than everyone else."

Credibility

[Question] have you ever gotten together to decide at what point the PvdA
can no longer continue to participate in the cabinet?

[Answer] "Without having talked it out , we all know precisely where the line
is. The line is the uncoupling of the minim.- sociel security benefits from
the minim-I wage. And for me personally, there is also the breakdown of the
system of equal treatment for enployees in private industry and in the govern-
ment. For the party, then, uncOupling is the breaking point, but for me there
is also the breakdown of the trend policy [001A]. If the MA should develop
a different policy on that at any tins. I could no longer defend it with any
credibility."

[Question] So you are still thinking of stepping down in that case?
[Answer] "A different men would have to do that."

[Question] In the past months, the PvdA ministers have continually been
confronted with ultinata from the priao minister. Further-ore, Minister Van

Der Stee of finances was continually feeding new, or so-called new. infom-
tion to the cabinet.

24.

eves u..--...- -us- v”..-

[Answer] Those are precisely the two things that have made se feel uncomfort-
able as a member of this cabinet. Or to put it better: there are three. In
the first place. there cannot be good management if every day you get a fresh
blow delivered to your office free your colleague in finance. The manner in
which financial decisiomnaking takes place in a cabinet like that will always
be chaotic. Anyone who constantly wants to stack alteration on alteration, at
the tempo of a repeating rifle. is calling for ad hoc decisions and quasi
cutbacks. I know very well that our colleagues from the CDA do not trust us
as far as cutbacks are concerned. we are paying our tuition to the WI). The
ministers in the last cabinet did not cut back. Thus. according to the CM.
we have to pay for the bad policy of our liberal predecessors. I do not find
that to be reasonable. If we conit ourselves to certain cutbacks. then

perhaps it will take awhile. but it will happen."

[Question] You spoke of the tespo of a repeating rifle. with which the so—
called new setbacks whirl in. Did that not primarily also have the function
of a repeating rifle, that is: to shoot you down?

[Answer] "I cannot rule that out. And as far as the presentation of policy
by the prise sinister is concerned: the sanner in which the cabinet policy

is made public will have to be isproved. for it can certainly not go on as it
is. It is completely essential for the existence of this cabinet that the
coalition partners are given the latitude to carry out their own policy.
Finally. the question: has the prime sinister bagatellised and ridiculed
this cabinet and thereby the PvdA contingent in it? I sust adsit that this
has been the case. The inage which the prise sinister presented to the public
did not always correspond to the actual course of events. I have often felt
in the past nonths that I have not been defended by my prise sinister. I
refuse to accept that I as a senber of a bad cabinet. There is enough talent
available to do something. It is up to the prise sinister to weld that talent
together and to stand up for the cabinet as a whole. [that he said 2 days
after the provincial elections. that he would no longer act as a party son.
but as the prise sinister of a coalition cabinet, that ought to have happened
much earlier, long before the provincial elections. This cabinet can only
survive and function if the first salesmen of its policy carries out that
function. I do hope that will be the case now that the provincial goverment
elections are over, but during the past sonths it has certainly been colorful
sonetises."

Rolling Heads

[Question] Why did you put up with all of that public shearing? Many of
your voters sust not have like that.

[Answer] "I certainly was on the point from tine to tins of putting in a
call to Thailand." (hbsrrassed laugh.) "But seriously, we did refuse to see
a lot. Too such."

[Question] But why did you do that?

[Answer] "Because of the fssous personal relationships in the cabinet. I
fear."

[Question] And they need only be cultivated in the cabinet council on Friday.
After that, Van Agt could go his own way. beginning with the press conference
after the council of ministers seeting where you had once again cultivated
those personal relationships.

[Answer] "0h. usually you did not see Van Agt for another week. at the next

and the HAAGSE Bum. But it does not seen that a long political leash has been
allotted to Chair-an Van Den Berg.

pressed everywhere effectively. I would think it an extraordinarily bad

thing, and rather rank. if discussions were to cone about now about the people
who should be termed responsible for the setback. Indeed. no one would escape,
it is the collective responsibility of very my people."

DESPITE SONE LAUNCH PROBLEMS, BXOCET HISSILBS TO BE ON 236 SHIPS
Paris AIR ET COSMOS in French [7 Apr 82 p 43

[Article by Pierre Langereux: "236 Ships Equipped with the Exocet Antiship His-
siles”]

[Text] The Exocet antiship missiles from Aerospatiale, versions HH-38 and
nn-ao, are or will be installed on 236 ships of all types belonging to more
than 20 countries, including France. The Exocets are or will be installed on
l27 ships of more than 1,000 tons, 79 of then with HH-38's and 48 with Hh-AO's.
But more than a hundred (109) ships of less than 1,000 tons will also be armed
with Exocet--78 with HH~38's and 31 with MM-éO's. To date, 1 year after the
first deliveries (March 1981), the HH-AO has been ordered by 6 countries to
equip 22 missile-launching patrol boats of less than 300 tons. This demon-
strates the interest in the MH-AO as modern antiship armament for light patrol
boats, explained Hr Bussieres of Aerospatiale at the Naval Exposition of
Haastricht.

Powerful but Very Compact Armament

Patrol boats do indeed need weapons of the same performance characteristics (in
terms of range. precision, reliability, effectiveness) as those equipping the
biggest units; and this is made possible by the current antiship missiles,
which are capable of giving a patrol boat of a few hundred tons' displacement
the firepower of a minicruiser. But in particular, the antiship weapons sys-
tems have to be sufficiently compact (in View of the limited space on board
Small vessels), while at the same time giving the patrol boat simplified ease
of use, salvo-firing capacity and also a "second strike" capacity.

The un-ao is an antiship missile with a transhorison range (70 km) optimized in
function of performance characteristics of autonomous flight at high subsonic
speeds (Mach 0.9) and with high probability of destruction. The experience of
the HH-38 has shown that the missile is 93-percent successful in operational
firings, with 94-percent availability after 1 year of storage (without mainten-
ance) on board ships.

The uu—ao weapon system is compact enough to be easily installed on a light
patrol boat, in sufficient quantity to offer high firepower. The light firing
installation produced for the m-ao by Aerospatiale comprises a central unit,

connected to the missiles by a junction unit and to the vessel's operations
center by a control console that enables a single operator to operate the com-
plete weapon system, with the aid of a tactical-assistance computer (CATS).
The firing installation (ITL) can put eight missiles into action simultaneous-
ly, which corresponds to the number of HH-bO's that can be installed on a light
patrol boat. In effect, the HM-éo is presented in the form of a completely
self-contained munition: the missile is installed (with airfoils and control
surfaces folded back) in a watertight cylindrical container (diameter 0.65 m)
made of a fiberglass-resin composite that is both strong and light. The com-
plete nunition (missile in container) weighs 1,250 kg, the missile itself
weighing 850 kg. This makes it possible to install four MM-bO's in the same
space as two HH-38's, thus providing double the instantaneous firepower, which
is very important for patrol boats that cannot reload their missile launching
ramps at sea. The Hn-ao weapon system thus gives patrol boats a second-strike
capacity (for protecting themselves, if necessary) and enables them to fire in
salvos (to saturate the enemy defenses). In particular, the light firing in-
stallation makes it possible to fire a salvo of 4 missiles in 9 seconds (in a
calm sea), Aerospatiale states.

Patrol boats nay nevertheless have difficulties in taking full advantage of the
range performance characteristics of the new first-generation transhorizon
antiship missiles such as the HM-AO, whose range (70 km) requires the use of a
relay for acquisition and target designation for the launching ship. In this
regard, patrol boats are indisputably at a disadvantage in comparison with the
big units, which often have helicopters available on board, or at least advance
support from smaller units.

Acrospatiale considers, though, that this disadvantage can be palliated by the

use. as relays, either of maritime-patrol airplanes or of other patrol boats in
an advanced position in the attack formation. It is also possible to take ad-

vantage--quite often and in many places--of exceptional propagation conditions

(reflection off the lower layers of the ionosphere) that in practice extend the
range of the radars beyond the horizon.

COMMAND CHAIN, DEFENSE PRIORITIES 0F PINISTERB SEA REGION
Paris ARHEES D'AUJOURD'HUI in French Apr 82 pp 33-35
[Article By Colonel Lilian Cotteaux: "The Defense of the Finiatare"]

[Text] Essential to credible deterrence is a solid defense of
the sensitive points. This is an important mission which the
maritime prefect of the second region is carrying out with

the assistance of a general-staff element from the Army.

Because of the facilities that it offers to the Navy of the western ocean and
to the service departments that support it, the roadstead of Brest, a calm har-
bor on the edge of an ocean of legendary angers, has always experienced intense
activity that has given rise to the development of many organisms of a maritime
nature .

The extension of the independence of weapons systems to nuclear deterrence, re-
presented materially by the placing in service of the missile-launching nuclear
submarines, has entailed the creation of the lie Longue operational base and a
command and support environment along the roadstead but also inland.

The multiplication of major sensitive points in the territory of Finistere led
the government to assign to the admiral who is maritime prefect of the second
region and commander-in-chief for the Atlantic the responsibilities for main-
tenance of order, protection of sensitive points and operational defense of the
territory throughout the entire department of Finistere (decree of 24 August
1970 creating the command for defense of Finistere: CDP). On this basis, the
maritime prefect comes under the general commanding the Heat defense zone.

This is the admiral's third cap.

in order to enable the maritime-prefect admiral to exercise this command, an
Army field officer is assigned as an assistant to him and an office for opera-
tional defense of the territory is included in his general staff. It is com-
posed of three Army officers and a secretariat. The Army assistant exercises
the functions of this command by delegation, but with the exception of mainten-
ance of order.

As DOT [Operational Defense of the Territory] assistant to the maritime pre-
fect, he assists him in all matters relative to land protection and defense in

the second maritime region and represents him vis-a-vis the prefect of Finis-
tere as adviser for preparation of crisis plans and the general protection
plan. he also acts as an interface between the command of the second maritime
region, the land territorial cmmmands--third military region, 31st territorial
military division and fourth military region--and the second air region.

The Sensitive Points in Finistere

without wishing to neglect the importance of certain civilian sensitive points
(Ps's). we shall deal here only with the military sensitive points. This gen-
eral term covers installations of all kinds and of very different dimensions.
The Brest naval yard, lle Longue and the Brignogan signal station are three
sensitive points. of course, but their interest to the command obviously is not
identical. These sensitive points are assigned a classification, in function
of their purpose and the quality of their equipment, that determines a level of
protection to be provided, either permanently or in case of threat.

Finistere has a great many PS's of all categories, coming under the three armed
forces and the General Delegation for Armament. Bach armed force is respons-
ible for the protection of its own installations, and for this purpose estab—
lishes a particular protection plan for each P8.

In the matter of defense, command and coordination of operations comes exclus-
ively under the CDF, which in this case activates the defense plan for Finis-
tere. which is an emanation of the defense plan for the Heat zone.

The CDF's Resources

These resources, limited in peacetime, expand very rapidly in time of crisis
and peak in the first stages of mobilisation. The installation of the blst In-
fantry Regiment at Ty-Vougeret, near Chateaulin, in 1979 permitted better ad-
aptation, in a normal time, of the means devoted to the protection and defense
of the Ps's coming under the Strategic Naval Force (POST).

These means, furnished on a permanent basis by the 9th DIHa (.arine divi-
sin"), of which the 41st RI [Infantry Regiment] is an integral part, combine
for immediate reinforcement of the Ps's of the strategic nuclear force on the
decision of the maritime prefect for the first echelon, and the commanding gen-
eral of the 3rd Military Region for the totality. Their mobility is particu-
larly increased by the helicopter-transport capacities offered by the Naval Air
Force. with its Super-Frelons, based at Lanveoc-Poulmic.

From the first stages of mobilization, the Navy activates its reserve units
(UR's [Reserve Units] and UND's [expansion unknownl). The Gendarmerie doubles
its strength and sets up several intelligence platoons. The Army calls up two
' infantry regiments (the 19th and the 118th 81's) and a division type of general
staff. Basic coverage of the entire department is thus achieved-—that is, the
security of the PS's and the significant first-level interventions.

The various interbranch exercises and maneuvers within the framework of the CDF
or within that of the West defense zone emphasise the importance and effective-

30

FORTOFFKJAI.USEGDNLY
FIN!(HNHK1AL.USE(MNLY

ness of the defense instrument which the command can have at its disposal, no
matter what the type of threat or the general situation is at the moment.

But security rests in the first place on the effectiveness of the means of re-
search and exploitation of intelligence. The presence of many PS's/FNS [Sensi-
tive Points of the Strategic Nuclear Forces] in North Pinistere has led to the
creation of a special surveillance area encompassing these PS/FNS and a liaison
bureau (BDL) within which the coordination of intelligence is done. All the
administrationsandthe military organisms of the three armed forces and the
Gendarmerie that have the mission of participating in the gathering and exploi-
tation of intelligence within the limits of their assignments are represented
within this liaison bureau. which has a permanent secretariat.

The BDL of Finistere permits collaboration and very fruitful regular exchanges
anong the various parties, thereby giving the lie to a banal and too often
evoked stereotype--that of the war of the intelligence services.

The diversity of the objectives that the CD? has been given the mission of pro-
tecting and defending, the range of sensitivities that they represent, and the
variety of the resources that combine for fulfillment of the missions assigned
imply that the authorities permanently responsible at all levels weave a net-
work of solid and unequivocal relations and that they be able to have total
confidence in one another in order for the relative fragility of the structure,
due to its apparent heterogeneity, to be transformed into a solid block that
can endure any trial.

Nuclear deterrence forms a whole. The Finistere defense command participates
in this deterrence in a considerable manner by combining in particular for pro-
tection of the systems for transmission of orders and data between the chief of
state and the missile-launching submarines and by ensuring the security of the
installations of the Strategic Naval Force and of the maritime approaches of
the roadstead of Brest.

Colonel Lilian Cotteaux, of the Marine Troops, has been Army
assistant to the maritime prefect of the second region since
l979. He holds the BEHS [Diploma of Higher Military Studies]
and the BT [technical baccalaureate'degree] and is an officer of
the Legion of Honor, and he has received four citations.

SUBSONIC TARGET TESTED--Aerospatiale announces that the 10th flight test of the
C-22 target missile was carried out successfully on 25 hatch at the Landes
Testing Center (GEL), the site of the preceding tests of this new autonomous
target intended to replace the CT-20 target missile, also produced by Aerospa-
tiale for the French and foreign firing ranges. This 10th test flight was made
with c-22 target No 004, which had been recovered by parachute after a preced-
ing test flight and had been subjected only to the routine checks and recondi-
tioning before being reused. In the course of this 10th flight, which lasted
38 minutes, the c-22 target did maneuvers at various altitudes, speeds and load
factors. In particular, it did a continuous bank under 4 G and over more than
600° of change of bearing without loss of altitude. The speeds reached during
this test varied from hach 0.6 to Each 0.9 (maximum speed), which made it pos-
sible to explore the entire flying range of the tsrget-missile's engine. The
6-22, as we recall, is powered by a TRI 60-2 turbojet from Hicroturbo. The
C-22 is a subsonic target missile with variable speed (Mach 0.0-0.9) and long
range (1,300 km), capable of flying at very low altitude and up to 13,000 kn.
The missile measures 5.1 u long by 2.5 m airfoil span, and it weighs 530 kg.
The C-22 development program has now entered the principal phase of flight-
testing, which is to proceed with many other flights between now and this sum-
mer, particularly with target 000, which will be reconditioned for coming
tests. The c-22 is to go into service on the French firing ranges next year.

ARIANE DELAY UPSE’I’S REMAINIK: LAUNCH solemn
Paris AIR ET cosmos in French 20 liar 82 p 33

[Article by Pierre Langereuxz "At Least a Z-lbnth Delay for the Next Ariane
Munch")

[Text] The first actual launching of the European spaceship "Ariana," which
was to take place on 23 April 1982, has been delayed "for at least 2 mnths"
due to the lack of availability of one of the two European satellites con-
stituting the payload. me European Space Agency [BSA] has just officially
announced this postponement due to recent operational defects in the "HARECS
A" satellite, which is currently in synchronous orbit. This satellite, identi-
cal to the "was 8" which is to be launched in 1 math, did indeed find that
its relate-control, remote-sensing system was affected by electrostatic dis-
charges caused by increased solar activity occurring as of the beginning of
February. Oranges in operational procedures (manual control of the satellite)
were iuplemented to protect the "names A," which then functioned properly.
However, it proved necessary to unite modifications to the "names 8" before
its launching, entailing a delay of undetermined duration. Similarly, the
"BCS" satellites, also built under British Aerospace contracts, will have to
be nodified, as they use the sense launching pads as the “HAM." But this
should not affect their launches. 0n the other hand, considering the length
of launch canpaigns (generally 3 nonths), a delay in die next Arisne launch
by at least 2 aonths-oin other words, to the and of June 1982 at the earliest--
may mean shipping a launch slot at Kourou. For there are no other satellites
ready to substitute for the "KAEECS 3" and the "Sirio 2" in April. So now we
can only count on three Ariane launches this year instead of four. This would
also affect next year's launch schedule, which is already filled.

This is what will happen unless, despite everything. the CUBS [National Space
Studies Center] and the SSA can succeed in holding four Ariana launches this
year, the "HARBCS B" is indeed available in 2 months, and the launch cawaign
can be reduced to just 2 months—as was planned beginning in 1986. For the
moaent, however, the April 1982 laund: has been canceled and the launch team
have been sent back hone, leaving the rocket with its three stages assenbled

on the launch site.

This incident, which prevented the initial linkup via the ”MOS A" on
23 February, is also going to delay the actual putting into service of the

33

"HARBCS" end to disrupt the operations program at luau-set, the organization
which use to use then.

The "HARECS" satellites definitely pose any probleu. In fact. the launch-
ing of the first one, "HARECS A." had to be deleyed for several maths. fol-
lowing the belated discovery of a technical failure in the electronic cir-
cuits of the satellite's antenna.

ane"!

[Text] Fokker (The Netherlands) will shortly deliver to the C888 [National
Center for Space Studies] the parachute recovery system for the first stage of
the Ariane launcher, to be flight-tested on the occasion of the seventh firing
of the Ariane rocket, planned in principle for October 1982 with the European
astronomical satellite onsat.

Fokker is responsible for the design and construction of this device for recov-
ery by parachute, intended to brake the fall into the sea of this stage which
is 18 m long and weighs about 16 t (after combustion), and also to ensure that
it floats until the arrival of the recovery ship. The system is composed es-
sentially of four main parachutes made by Irvin (Great Britain) and a number of
small extractor parachutes supplied by Autoflug (PRC). The total system
weighs 850 kg and is installed in the interstage skirt (between the first and
second stages), which is also made by Fokker, as part of its principal partici-
pation in the Ariane program.

The recovery system functions in two phases. After extinction of the first
stage (liquid fuels), the stage is separated from the rest of the launcher at
about 40 km altitutde. It free-falls at 160 m/sec to about 6 km altitude,
where the extractor parachutes open that stabilise the stage and deploy an in-
termediate parachute that slows down the fall. Then at about 1,000 m altitude,
the four main parachutes (diameter about 20 m each) open simultaneously so as
to finally reduce the speed of fall (and impact in the sea) to only 12.5 m/sec.

Recovery of the first stage of the present Ariane launcher should make it pos-
sible, if successful, to save about 10 percent of the launcher's cost, by the
recovery and reuse of certain elements such as engines and tanks.

Fokker, we note, has prooosed to make the nose cones for the liquid-fuel boost-
ers of the future Ariane 4 launcher, which could also be equipped with a para-
chute recovery device.

VOLVO PARTICIPATING IN ARIANB-Volvo Flyg-otor (Svedeno has begun work on the
developeent of the nozzle and turbines for the future 90-100-ton thrust,

HM 60 heavy cryogenic engine for the luropean rocket that is to succeed the
Ariane 4. Volvo Plyg-otor is one of the three European Ianufecturere cur-
rently involved in developing the new RH 60 cryosenic engine, with 83?
[European Propellant Company] (France), in cooperation with HEB [expansion
unknown] (Germany), being the najor contractor. Volvo already has received
a contract from the Swedish Space Corporation for this work. We may recall
that Volve has been participating since 1974 in the building of Viking en-
gines for the first and second stages of the Ariana rocket-11kevise as a

gzggontractor for 88?. [Text] [Paris AIR ET COSHOS in French 20 Her 82 p 33]

ARIANE BOOSTER FAILS--The first test-bench firing of the new solid-fuel booster
intended for the Ariane 3 launcher ended in failure. After normal ignition and
initial functioning, two perforations appearedinthe rear baseoftheengineafter
some 10 seconds of combustion. These leaks of hot gases caused destruction of
the rear base and ejection of the propelling nozzle about 20 seconds after fir-
ing. The expert investigation has revealed very heavy erosion of the propel-
ling nozzle‘s internal heat protection, as the result of combustion more turbu-
lent than expected. The rear part of the booster is going to be modified be-
fore the second test-bench firing, which will be delayed l to 2 months. The
Ariane 3 booster has been developed by the Italian company Difesa e Spasio.

One booster was recently delivered to Aerospatiale (cf AIR ET COSMOS, No 902).
