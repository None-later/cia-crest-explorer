REFERENCE AID -- GLOSSARY OF NORTH KOREAN TENS

This glossary supersedes REFEREE! AID: GIDSSARY OF NORTH KOREAN TERMS, JPRS,
May 1973. It provides standardized English translations of terns used in

North Korea, drawn primarily from the North Korean press, and will aid in
achieving consistency in the translation of key North Korean terns and con-

cepts. Many of the terms in this glossary represent synthesized expressions
of several related strains of thought, sons of which appear in slogans and
are. for the soot part, "live" political concepts, rich in application and
full of underlying inplicationa. A full explanation of all terns, however.
is beyond the scope of this glossary. M cowlenantary approaches were
used in the comilation of this glossary. First, defini :ions were compiled

froa Korean dictionaries published in Pyongyang. Second, systeastic coweri-
sons were aade. between the original texts of official pronounce-tents appear-
ing in the North Korean press and English-language printed texts enanating
concurrently from Pyongyang. The basic Korean alphabetization systen was

applied throughout this glossary. As an added note, North Korea has for
many years been engaged in an extensive language reforn novenent. In

accordance with government policy, a concerted effort is being nade to purge
the language of foreign words and to replace Sine-Korean conpounds by coining
new words of “purely Korean" origins. This nave-ant is especially evident in
descriptions pertaining to industrial processes and products. This glossary
reflects this esphasia.

REFERENCE AID - DATA ON SERIAL PUBLICATIONS OP VIETNAM

The following is an alphabetical listing of periodicals published in the
Socialist Republic of Vietnaa [SRV] along with available data on alternate
titles, sponsorship, officers and contents for each publication. The index
number assigned to a publication is a control nuuber used to facilitate
ordering and distribution. Approxinstely 311 newspapers, magazines, journals,
bulletins and newsletters are published in the SRV including 225 national
level publications (10 in foreign languages) and 86 local level publications
(3 in foreign languages). Included at the national level are publications

published by or intended for the Vietnaa Co-unist Party and other political
parties; mess organizations; econonic, cultural, and science and technology

sectors; military branches of service and religious groups. The 35 provinces
and three separate municipalities each have their own newspaper. In addi-

tion, at least 16 of these sdninistretive divisions publish one or sore
journals concerned with culture, education or science and technology. Local

publications focus alnost exclusively on local events and issues and supple-
nent rather than replace their national level counterparts. In this listing,

the title appearing on the front cover of a publication is used as the nsin
entry. Any variations of the title as it appears on the title page or in

citations elsewhere are entered as alternate titles. This report replaces a
report with the same title published as JPRS 71592 dated 1 August 1978 and
Addendu- of the same date.
