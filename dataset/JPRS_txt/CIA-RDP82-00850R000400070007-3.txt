VICTORIA MP'S SAY DRUG RING IS INVOLVED IN HEAT SCANDAL
Sydney THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD in English 12 Sep 81 p 6
[Article by Greg Wilesmith: "Drug Ring Controls Heat, MPs Claim"]

[Excerpts] Two Victorian Liberal HPs claim that an international drug ring is
involved in the meat export substitution racket.

The HPs, Hr Maurice Williams (MLA, Doncaster) and Mr Don Saltmarsh, HLC, believe
that organised crime in Australia and in the United States now controls major
sectors of Australia's meat and transport industries.

Mr Williams said that a director of one of Victoria's leading meat companies
has links with the Las Vegas mafia.

According to the HPs meat exports are an excellent way of smuggling drugs out
of Australia.

Cartons of meat stamped Australia Approved are packed into containers on board
ships. Dogs trained to "sniff" narcotics find it difficult to detect drugs
concealed in meat.

Neither of the UPS could provide the HERALD with any evidence to support their
claims. They said that their information was privileged and sources could not
be identified.

However, Mr Williams suggested that evidence to the Royal Commission into drug
trafficking should be collated with that presented to Mr Justice Woodward's
Royal Commission into the meat industry.

Mr Williams has had a longstanding interest in the alleged meat substitution
rackets operating in Victoria.

In November 1977 he told the Federal Police that meat processed at abattoirs
owned by the Melbourne City Council and licensed only for the local market,
had allegedly been illegally transferred to a meatworks which was licensed
for the export trade.

The police invostigated the allegations, but laid no charges.
0n the cartons found to contain horse and kangaroo meats the stamp read 1406.
That was the stamp of Profreeze, a business name registered with Protean (Hold—
ings) Ltd of the inner Melbourne suburb of Richomond.

Preteen is a service company--it rents out its abattoirs, boning rooms and
freezing stores to individual contractors and companies in the meat industry.

It says it had been leasing boning room 1aoc to Mr Richard Hammond, who traded
as Hammond Wholesale and Retail Heats Pty Ltd.

Mr Hammond appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday on 21 charges
relating to the presence of horse and kangaroo meat in export beef cartons.

No pleas were taken and Hr Hammond was released on $10,000 bail to appear
again on October 9.

The company, which operates in most States in Australia. normally employs
between 1.500 and 2,000 people and has an annual turnover of more than $100
million.

It has expanded considerably this year, entering into a share transfer deal
with the Mascot Industries Ltd Group. through which it acquired that company' s
meat subsidiares in NSW, Western Australia and Victoria.

One of the subsidiaries acquired was Pridham (Aust) Pty Ltd which, among other
interests. operated a knackery at Dandenong, near Melbourne, where horses
were slaughtered for pet food.

The Protcan Company is no stranger to controversy. The tenms of its lease
with Richmond council have been an issue in council politics for years.

Mr Williams told the Victorian Parliament in March last year that the com-
pany's highly favorable lease had cost ratepayers "an enormous fortune."

The company is also involved in litigation with J.A. Dundas Pty Ltd.. a sub-

sidiary of Nortico (Aust) Pty Ltd, over plant and equipment at the Newmarket
ahattoirs, owned by the Melbourne City Council and leased to Protean.

BEROIN 'FLOOD' EXPECTED FOLLOWING RECENT POLICE SEIZURES
Sydney THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD in English 17 Sep 81 p 2
[Article by Paul Molloy: "Detectives Prepare for Busy Heroin Period"]

[Text] Australian Federal Police Drugs Unit detectives fear a flood of high-
grade Middle-Eastern heroin into Australia following two seizures of the drug
worth nearly $1 million on the streets in the past week. '

In the latest operation, detectives from the unit. led by Detective-Sergeant
Trevor Young, raided a house in ﬂampden Street, Lakemba. investigating a ship-
ment of 620 grams of heroin.

The heroin, which was concealed in a hidden compartment in the soles of two
pairs of shoes. had been detected last Friday after a tip-off from Interpol.

A Lebanese couple returning to Sydney from a holiday in Lebanon aboard an Air
India flight were detained at Sydney Airport by the detectives, who found the
number 3 grade heroin which has a street value of more than $600,000.

The detectives said it was 55 percent pure.

Detective-Sergeant Young said the couple were innocent victims of smugglers
who asked them to take the shoes to Australia for friends.

After the shoes were opened. a powder was substituted for the heroin and the
shoes stitched up again. The couple then gave the shoes to a courier.

Police said that when they raided the house yesterday afternoon they found
one of the pairs of shoes in the back of an automatic clothes drier. The
other pair were in a bedroom.

A 26-year-old Lakemha man will appear in the St James Court of Petty Sessions
today charged with being knowingly concerned with the importation of heroin
under the Customs Act.

The raid closely follows the arrest of a man at Sydney Airport a week ago who
was carrying 100 grams of heroin in a plastic bag stitched into the shoulder
padding of his coat.
The heroin came from the Golden Crescent area which runs through Turkey, Iran,

Lebanon and Syria. There was a large opium crop there this year, which means
heroin supplies will be larger than nor-a1.

Detective-Sergeant Young said that without good intelligence inside and out-
side Australis it was difficult to detect this type of snuggler.

ROYAL COWISSION 0N DRUG TRAFFICKING HEARS TESTIMONY
Passport Racket
Canberra THE AUSTRALIAN in English 9 Sep 81 p 1

( Article by Mat-salt Mackinnon: "Judge Hire at 'Loose' Control of Passports")

[Excerpt]

THE Department of For-
elgn Affairs disclosed yestero
day about 5000 Australian
passports were lost or stolen
each year. It admitted
people could easily “trade"

passports for drugs or
money and reenter Aus-

tralia "clean" beause of

loose passport controls.

The department said most
passports were lost or stolen in
South-East Asia.

The director oi the depart~
ment‘s passport division. Mr
Kevin Gray, told the Royal
Commission into Drug Trai~
licking that the department
detected only about six
"recycled" passports a year.

And the commissioner. Mr
Justice s:ewart. said because
at the looseness o! the pass-
port checking system it would
be "impossible to know how
many illegal passports there
are".

He sald people were possibly
using the stolen passports to
travel in the main drug-pro-
ducing countries. then aub-
atitutinc genuine passports to
re-enter Australia. The genu-
ine passport would not have

NETHERLANDS DRUG SUPPLY LINK CUT HIT“ ARREST IN PERTH
Perth THE WEST AUSTRALIAN in English 12 Sep 81 p 32

[Text] A heroin connection between the Netherlands and Australia was smashed
when members of the police drug squad arrested Frank Colangelo (23) in Perth.

As a result of Colangelo's cooperation, the source of the drug was traced to
the Netherlands and the Dutch supply was broken with the help of Interpol.

Colangelo, a therapist, of Selden Street, North Perth..appearsd in the Supreme
Court yesterday for sentence on a charge of possessing heroin with intent to
sell or supply it.

he had admitted the offence, which occurred in August last year at North Beach.

The court heard that members of the drug squad kept Colangelo under observa-
tion before stopping him outside a chiropractor's clinic where he worked.

Syringe

A search was made of his vehicle. when the dashboard was removed, the police
found a syringe, needles and a package containing heroin.

Colangelo was taken to his home. where hewas stripped. More heroin was found
hidden in his underpants.

Mr Justice Smith said that the pre-sentence report contained the all-too-
familiar story of a person starting on cannabis and progressing quickly to
hard drugs.

As a result of treatment. Colangelo had overcome his drug problem.

But thanks to his help, a previously-unknown source of supply of the drug
had been cut off and other people were arrested and dealt with by the courts.

Colangelo was placed on probation for two years on condition that he report
as necessary to the Alcohol and Drug Authority. He was also ordered to do

100 hours community service work.

NEH DRUG LEISIATION INTRODUCED IN VICTORIA PARLIAMENT
Brisbane THE COURIER-MAIL in English 24 Sep 81 p 1

[Text] Helbourne--Drug traffickers face up to 25 years jail and fines of as
much as $250,000 under legislation introduced in the Victorian Parliament yester-
day.

The Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Bill, brought in by the Victorian
Health Minister, Mr Borthwick, also provides for confiscation of assets of traf-

fickers .

The maximum fine of $250,000 for trafficking in a drug of dependence is $50,000
higher than that recommended by an inter-departmental working party on the drug
problem.

The working party's report provided the basis of the new legislation.

This provision covers narcotics such as morphine, opium and its derivatives, such
as heroin, and synthetic drugs such as methadone.

Hr Borthwick said the Government had rejected the working party's recommendation
that courts shOuld have the option of imposing a fine or a jail term, or both.

'ﬁhe Government takes the view that trafficking in drugs of dependence is such a
heinous offence that the courts should not have an option of imposing a fine in
lieu of a jail sentence," he said.

The Bill sets a maximum penalty of two years jail and/or $5000 fine for unlawful
possession of a drug of dependence.

Trafficking in a restricted substance, such as barbiturates will carry a maximum
10 years jail or $100,000 penalty or both. Possession will incur up to two years
jail, a $5000 fine or both.

DRUG OFFENSES INCREASING IN QUEENSLAND, COMSSION mu)
Brisbane THE COURIER-MAIL in English 24 Sep 81 p 12]

[Excerpt] Heroin was readily available throughout Queensland, the Brisbane Drug
Squad chief told the Royal Commission of inquiry into drug trafficking in Australia
yesterday.

lnsp. Eric Patrick Deveney told the commission hearing in Brisbane there was now
twice the amount of heroin available on the the streets that there was 12 months
ago.

He said fewer drug addicts were registering for methodone treatment in Queensland
this year. The Royal Connissioner, Mr Justice Stemrt, said that with more heroin
around, fewer addicts would have to turn to "the crutch of methodone."

Insp. Deveney said there had been a 20 percent increase this year in offences
relating to hard drugs, including heroin and 1.80.

There had also been a "sizeable increase" in the nuwer of offences in the state
relating to cannabis and hashish.

He said cocaine was readily available in Queensland and LSD, which had been scarce
for some time, was "coming back on."

The emission is inquiring into possible drug trafficking and related activites
of Terrence John Clark, also known as Alexander James Sinclair, and his associates.

(Clark, reputed to be the head of an international drug ring called the Organisa-
tion, is serving a life sentence in England for the murder of martin Johnstone,
the 'Hr Asia" of the Australian-New Zealand-British heroin trade).

Insp. Deveney agreed with Mr Justice Stewart that the supposed cessation of
Clark's operations had not made any difference to the availability of heroin in
Queensland.

The min source of heroin was still importation through overseas couriersuthe
method the commission has been told Clark adopted.

"If you knock one down, another one pops up," Mr Justice Stewart said. He supposed
it was because of the enormous profits that could be made.

The litficulty over stopping the growing of
the opium poppy in Thailand does not lie in
knowing where the crop is because
plantings can he discovered from the air or
even on the ground. The technology of
destroying crops brings no problem either
because chemicals or flamethrower: can
do that effectively. The reason that the
crop has not been destroyed is political.

RESPONSE TO U.S. 'PRESSURE' 0N NARCOTICS DISCUSSED
BK020400 Bangkok NATION REVIEW in English 2 Oct 81 p 5
[Article by Suthichai Yun]

[Text] American impatience with the lack of action in the destruction of opium
fields up north may not be conveyed too bluntly to Prime Minister Prem Tinsulsnon
during his discussions with American leaders in Hashington next week. But the
presence of Police Maj Gen Phao Sarasin, secretary general of the Office of
Narcotics Control Board, Thailand's best-known drug fighter, will certainly
rekindle attention on the problem.

'He appreciate the Thai Government's effort in cracking down on narcotics so
far. But we also believe that the Thai Government could do more to destroy

the opium fields and to seriously get the big drug kingpins," a senior American
diplomat told the NATION earlier this week.

There is a touch of uneasiness in his tone. "We have been promised for quite
some years that opium growing in 10 so—called opium-free zones would be
dispensed with. But nothing has been done about it. Just take the case

of Chang Slfu (Khun Sa). the notorious drug kingpin with a private army of
3,000 to 4,000 men. He is known to be in the Thai side of the Thai—Burmese
border at times. But he remains at large," the American diplomat said.

While Deputy Premier Gen Prachuap Suntharangkun, who is in charge oc narcotics
suppression in his capacity as chairman of ONCE, will be discussing assistance
from the U.S. authorities during the visit next week, pressure will surely be
applied, if subtly, by the American side for the Thai authorities to "do more"
in this respect.

'Ve appreciate, of course. that there has been some progress in this field,
compared with the blatant growing of opium and operations of heroin refineries
ten years ago. But we would like to see more efforts devoted to the problem.
particularly with this year's bumper crop of opium in the Golden Triangle where
about 500 to 600 tons are expected to be harvested with the good weather this
year," the 0.5. diplomat said.

When v.5. charge d'affaires Burton Levin told the opening session of a meeting
of the 1981 east Asia regional narcotics conference in Bangkok in early
September that more efforts must be made by government to attack big-time
operators and eradicate poppy fields. he was certainly referring to Thailand

as well.
31
Perhaps because of the "complaints" from the American side, the office of
the Narcotics Control Board announced on Sept 1h--only two weeks before
Prime Minister's departure for the U.S.-—that a campaign would be launched
in November to eradicate poppy fields in 10 villages in Chiang Mai where
substitute crop programme had been introduced.

Obviously, the heat is on--although Thai officials maintain that it was hard
to follow rigidly the policy laid down since social, political and economic
factors had to be taken into consideration.

'Ve are not asking for miracles. We realize the complex problems involved in
the anti-narcotics task. But we certainly would like to see more efforts
from the Thai side," the American diplomat said.

The fact that Khun Sa, believe to be a narcotics kingpin of the "Golden Triangle"
with a 500,000 baht prize on his head could roam about freely on the Thai-

Burmese border area has certainly perturbed the American diplomat to a considerable
extent.

Pressure From Reagan on Drugs

President Reagan on Sept 28 (Monday) said in New Orleans in an address to the
International Association of Chiefs of Police that one of the major points in
his administration's new narcotics enforcement strategy would be a "foreign
policy that vigorously seeks to interdict and eradicate illicit drugs wherever
cultivated, processed or transported-—this includes the responsible used of
herbicides..." [passage published in italics]

If Reagan carried through that policy, the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok will come
under severe pressure to get some concrete actions from Thai anti-narcotics
officials to do something drastic up in the Golden Triangle.

Reagan's plan includes the establishment of a special council on narcotics
control consisting of the attorney general and the secretaries of state,
defence, treasury and others to "coordinate efforts to stop the drug flow
into this country."

Surely, Gen Prem will be informed in Washington of the latest move against drugs
by Reagan. And that could well mean a new phase in the Thai-0.8. cooperation
in this area.

Prisoner Exchange; Treading on Sensitive Ground

If the drug issue is raised in Washington between Fhai and 0.5. officials,
another related topic may well come up as well--the proposal mooted by
American officials for a U.S.-Thai treaty to return drug offenders to their
home countries to serve their sentences.

“If the American officials are unhappy over the poppy problem here. we are
equally upset over their proposal to have drug offenders serve their sentences
backhome. Is the 0.5. Government really serious about showing the potential
drug offenders that both governments mean business and that the punishment would
be harsh and uncompromising?“ commented a senior Thai official.
Unofficial discussions on the issue have been on for the past two years, accord-
ing to informed sources-—but the Thai Foreign Ministry has been somewhat

reluctant to proceed to the point of committing itself to such a proposed
treaty if it was to include drug convicts as well.

Several days before Gen Prem was to leave for the U.S.. it was reported that
American officials might try to link the prisoner repatriation issue with

defence assistance to Thailand when Thai and American officials hold talks
in Washington next week.

When acting U.S. Ambassador Burton Levin was asked in a press conference with
the local press on Tuesday. he admitted that the 0.8. Government would indeed
seek approval from Thailand for the repatriation of American drug offenders--

but he flatly denied that the progress of such negotiations would be linked
to American defence to Thailand.

Levin, apparently aware of the sensitivenesa of such a "linkage." told reporters:
'The repatriation would be considered on its own merits and would bear no
relation whatsoever to military aid to this country."

The reasoning from the v.5. side was not unpredictable: Such a treaty would
reduce the burden involved for both parties in rehabilitating foreign prisoners
with language and cultural problems. But the Thai officials. particularly
those at the Foreign Ministry knowledgeable about the negotiations, said the
reasons cited by the American side were far from convincing.

"If potential drug offenders know that they would serve their terms back in the
states, the deterrent effects would be much less--notthat the prison conditions
in Thailand are all that bad. But Thai laws and Thai jails must loom very large
in the mental pictures for all foreigners trying to get involved in narcotics
one way or the other," said the senior Thai official.

But whatever difference of opinion there might be on the issue, both sides are
expected to try to avoid discussing in detail the topic in Washington next week.

“They presumably would agree to disagree, waiting for another more opportune
timing to talk about it again," said a well-informed source on the issue.

Refugee Issue: Cutdown in Quota

It appears difficult for both sides to avoid stumbling, during their talks in
Washington next week. onto the refugee problem somehow. although both sides
haVe clahued mutual understanding on the issue.

The latest development in Washington on the issue might not have sparked off a
panic here. But its impact would slowly sink in. The Reagan administration
only on Sept 22 sought to admit up to 120.000 Indechinese refugees in fiscal
year 1982, compared to the current year's quota of 168.000.

"It is a cutdown. definitely if one looks at the overall quota. And there will
be further cutdowns. But the proposed decrease in admissions for the new fiscal
year was only to adjust the figure to a more realistic 1evel--since in fact,
only about 125,000 lndochinese will actually be admitted for fiscal year 1981,"
said a senior American diplomat.
He explained that the number of refugees coming from Indochina is going down
and the U.S. was only coping with the change in the outflow.

The U.S. diplomat said that there are a total of 195,000 Indochinese refugees
in Thailand now, 90,000 of than Kampucheans and the rest being Laotians,
Vietnamese and Hmongs.

'we will continue to take about 8,000 to 10,000 a month from Thailand," the
American diplomat said.

Thai authorities appear to be reasonably assured of that trend although there
are anxious minds that the U.S. cutdown in the future would make resettlement
opportunities for many refugees here shrink--particular1y with the new set of
more rigid rules governing the qualifications of refugees to be resettled in
the U.S.

The Thai leaders are expected to be told in Hashington by their American
counterparts that the proposed admission of up to 120,000 Indochinese next
fiscal year is an "upper limit" rather than a "operational target." The U.S.
hopes that it would not have to take that many refugees to maintain the
principle of first asylum and humane treatment of those who have already
arrived in Southeast Asia.

when U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs Halter Stoeasel told the
Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Imigration and Refugee Policy on Sept 22 that
the State Department would "make every effort" to operate the programme at
"lower admission rates." Thai officials certainly weren't quite appeased by the
statement. After all, the Thai Government has been trying every possible means
to reduce the current refugee population as soon as possible while trying to
apply "humane deterrence" against new arrivals.

Both sides are expected to settle for an acceptable and realistic solution.

When U.S. Attorney General William French Smith testified before the Senate
subcomnittee on Sept 22, he did not fail to point out the anxiety expressed

by "countries of first asylum" in Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, which,
in his own words, "have borne a heavy burden as a result of the instabilities
in Indochina since 1975. They have not been prepared to do so without an
assurance that the international community intended to continue to provide its
assistance in the onward resettlement of most of these refugees."

When the refugee issue is raised. Thai and Alerican officials will be discussing
additional means of "humane deterrence" to discourage the departure from their
homelands of those leaving for reasons other than persecution.

The discussion will also touch on the definition of a "refugee." Thai officials
have accepted the American line that persons who leave solely to seek economic
betterment do not meet the definition of refugee upon departure—but persecution
can and. Verv often. does take an economic form-
American officials have generally accepted the new tougher Thai policy of not
labelling those who arrive here after Aug 15, this year "refugees." Their
chuncus or being given resettlement in third countries would be given the
"lowest priority."

Both Thai and American officials said a drastic drop in new refugee arrivals
has been detected--but whether it's the new policy or the Ionsoon storms that
has brought this about remains unclear.

BURMA DRUG CARAVAN CLASHES WITH GOVERNMENT FORCES
BKlOOlOO Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 10 Oct 81 pp 1, 18
[Article by Subln Khuankaeo]

[Text] Chlang Rai--A suspected drug caravan that ran into fire from government
[urrus on Hedncsdav l7 October] was reported returning to the Burmese border
areas yesterday after a 2-day clash that left heavy casualties on both sides.

Informed sources told the BANGKOK POST that the drug caravan of about 200 mules,
believes to be carrying drugs controlled by narcotics kingpin Khun Sa, was
heading back to Burma at the area near Khun Mae Kham along with the kingpin
and troops of the Shan United Army.

The sources said they believed up to 24 rangers had been killed in the battle
in which they came under mortar fire from the caravan guards in the Ban Hin
Taek area.

Fifteen rangers of the fast mobile unit of 153rd Company from Pakthongchai,
Nakhon Ratchasima, survived but six were badly wounded and had to be carried
out in stretchers by a rescuing Border Patrol Police [BPPI unit.

The sources said a hilltribesman yesterday reported to a BPP platoon base in
Ban Hin Tnek. that he had seen 'hany" dead bodies, believed to be those of
the rangers. lying near the Mac Pok stream, about 100 metres from Ban A—Hai
where the battle took place.

‘nne sources said the actual mission of the ranger unit. which was kept so secret
that not even provincial internal security operations counand officials were
aware of it. was to capture Khun Sa for whose arrest the government has offered
a 500,000-baht reward.

According to the sources, the 39-mon ranger unit was bused from Pakthongchai
District to Mae Ai District of Chiang Mai where they disembarked and trekked
on foo: along the jungle path for two days toward Ban Hin Taek.

ﬁle ranger unit came across the ZOO-mule drug caravan in Ban Ko Samakkhi and
was attacked by the guards, forcing the unit to flee north toward Ban A-Hai.

The rangers camped near Mae Pnk stream in Van A-Bai but during the night,

according to one surviving ranger, they were surrounded by hundreds of caravan
guards.

37
The attack came at about a a.m. Thursday and lasted about three hours.

Informed sources said the drug caravan and its guards had been chased across
the Thai border by Burmese Government forces. They added the guards might have
mistaken the rangers as Burmere troops and started the attack.

A BPP platoon which was sent into Ban A-Hai to rescue the rangers Thursday
reportedly found 15 shallow holes of mortar emplacements in the grounds.
That incidated mortars had been used in pounding the besieged ranger unit.

Informed sources said the mystery surrounding the ranger mission deepened
further when border patrol policemen in Mae Chan District here Thursday
intercepted a bus and a pick-up truck carrying about 100 tough-looking men in
plainclothes.

Many weapons were found on the two vehicles.

The sources said the men later confessed to the BF? men that they were in fact
rangers from Pakthongchai. But they declined to disclose why they had come
to the province with their deadly weapons.

The rangers later set up a rear command at a teak reafforestation plot in
Mae Chan.

Three BPP platoons were again yesterday sent into Ban A-Hai to look for any
surviving rangers. They later found the six seriously wounded rangers taking
refuge in a village and carried them back to Ban Hin Tack in bamboo stretchers.
Informed sources said all the 8?? units had already withdrawn to their bases.

The Supreme Command in Bangkok said Thai troops skirmished with about 700 gunmen
of a drug caravan in Ban "in Taek, but added it had no reports of casualties.

CONTROL OF CHEMICAL FLOU—-Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prachuap Suntharangkun, in
his capacity as chairman of the Narcotics Control Board, has instructed the
governors of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai Provinces to prevent the flow of chemicals
used in heroin refining, such as acetic anhydride, from getting into the provinces
and then on to the border heroin refineries. Pol Maj Gen Phao Sarasin, secretary
general of the Narcotics Control Board. reported that the governors of the two
provinces had been asked to establish control measures which might include the
setting up of checkpoints. if effective, the move will contribute to the preven-
tion of heroin refining. The secretary general of the Narcotics Control Board
said Thailand must also continue to cooperate with Malaysia to stop the flow of
such chemicals from Malaysia into Thailand via their common border. Malaysia is
considering the enactment of a law for the control of chemicals used in heroin
production. If this step is taken, it is hoped that prevention and suppression
of heroin production would yield a better result, he said. [Text] [BK050927

COCAINE, MARIHUANA TRAFFICKERS ARRESTED IN JARDIM BOTARICO

Tip Leads to Arrest

Rio de Janeiro 0 GLOBO in Portuguese 5 Sep 81 p 11

(Text? Rancher Alvaro Marques Luz. aged 24, was caught red-handed and booked at the
Narcotics Bureau for drug addiction and trafficking after being taken unawares with
marihuana and cocaine evening before last at the apartment of trafficker Valeria Lemos
Telles, in Rua Hinistro Arthur Ribeiro, in Jardin Botanico. Valeria is at large, but
at her home the police confiscated her three memorandum books containing the names of
more than 100 customers.

Alvaro, who resides at Sao Bernardo ranch, in Huri, Nova Priburgo, and calls himself
a self—employed craftsman, said he has known Valeria for at least 3 years and knew
she was a trafficker because he sought her frequently to purchase narihuana. Day
before yesterday, he went with his wife, Simone de Sousa Cavalcanti, to Valeria's
apartment and Valeria-~having to go out-~asked him to take care of her customers.
She told him that, if a stranger came he should try to get rid of the drugs.

Through photographs, Alvaro recognized traffickers Jose Carlos de Souza, or Cacau,
Valeria's supplier, and Hen Xavier da Silveira.

The police went to Valeria's apartment after receiving anonymous tips indicating that
she was supplying drugs to people in society and in the artists' circle. They had
obtained a search warrant to enter the apartment.

Upon seeing the police, Alvaro Luz got rid of a certain amount of narihuana by
throwing it out the window. However, marihuana and cocaine were found on the premises.

Actor's Check

The rancher said that shortly before the police arrived at the apartment, he sold
cocaine to an actor who bought 2 grams with a check for 7,000 cruzeiros and returned
later to get 2 more grams, then giving a check for 14,000 cruzeiros. At the same
time, he tore up the first check. The police found the remains of the first check in

the trash, put the pieces together and submitted the torn check as evidence at the
trial.

[rag Manaus--'I‘he disclosure made by the American DEA [Drug Enforcement Adninistratiogu
a 0.5. organization specializing in the fight against drugs--that the Amazon regim

is now a large producer and exporter of cocaine came as no surprise to the Federal

Police authorities in Manaus: it was the Brazilian agents themselves who interned

their colleagues in the United States about the action being carried on by international,
traffickers in the Amazon River regim, principally after they had broken up an
organization operating out of Manaus in July 1980.

What surprised the Federal Police Department was finding great quantities of the drug
being cultivated in its native state in the area, not under the naae of coca but
under that of "epadu,’I with the Indians doing the planting and exporting the dry
leaves and paste to Colombian traffickers who proceed to cawert the material into
powder in the Mitu and Miraflores areas of Colombia within a few kilaaeters of the
Brazilian border. Bpadu is a plant known to the natives and used in their sacred
rituals, always in small quantities and never for comercial purposes.

Ivo Americana, regional superintendent of the Federal Police, said yesterday he has
no doubt that Indians of the Macu and 'rucano tribes living in Alto Rio Negro are

the ones who are producing epadu in larger quantities and that they even have the
technical knowledge to dry the leaves and cawert them into paste, which they sell
at prices ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 cruzeiros per kilogram. Denouncing the fact
that the Macu and Tucano Indians receive little help from the PUNAI [ﬁational

Indian Foundatiog' and are aided only partially by the Salesian missions, Ivo Americana
deplored the lack of funds and interest on the part of organizations connected with
this sector which should be taking stricter action in the area, 'not against the
Indians,‘ he said, "who are acting under the influence of third parties," but against
traffickers.

According to area experts, the Indians of Alto Rio Negro do not always receive money
from the Colombians for the paste, preferring portable radios, batteries, weapons and
ammunition for hunting, and fishing gear.

The criticisms of the regional superintendent of Federal Police were contested by
FUNAI's representative in Manaus, who agreed, however, that it was necessary to prevent
the Indians fran being induced to abandon their traditional small plantings to plant
only epadu. Another reason for the corrective action, according to the officials, is
that such activity could effect serious changes in native culture, since the plant

47
should be used only in rituals. The FUNAI officials also said that an agricultural
project has already been proposed to the Macu and Tucano Indians forbidding the
planting of epadu but that, up to now, the proposal has not becane a reality.

The area where the Federal Police discovered large plantings of coca is contained within
a region known as 'Boca de Cachorro,’ bound by the Icana. ‘riquie and Papuri rivers,
with about 200 square kilometers of land which is rough and of difficult access due

to crags as well as the rivers. The federal agents recently discovered another

fact: the traffickers are no longer converting the coca into chlorine hydrate. since

it is a slow and costly process, but just commercializing the epadu powder, that is.

the ground and sifted leaves, which are rustic but econaaical processes.

of an individual who has not yet been identified, floating in the water. Also in

of a shipment which may have amounted to a ton of that drug. The results of the
investigation thus far appear to indicate that the plane experienced some malfunction,

[Texg A gang uar has erupted in Berlin between Turkish and
Lebanese heroin dealers.

Berlin narcotics agents had been waiting for "their man" for more than 2 hours in a
Kreuzberg apartment. Then he came: Ahmet Oesergun - Turk, candidate for asylum,
heroin dealer. Criminal Police Director Gerhard Ulber, head of the "Joint Narcotics
Investigation Group" made up of police and customs officials, rqorts what happened
next: "Oezergm knocked, and before he knew it he was lying on the floor. Our

boys simply laid him out."

Hith good reason, as it turned out a little later: The Turk had a loaded revolver
in his belt. Says Ulber: "The business is getting more brutal all the tine. Now
we have to expect gunfire every time we make an arrest.‘.

Although no police officers have been hurt yet, there has been one dead narcotics
dealers Ali Jawhar, 2'7, died in a gang dwotout between Turks and Lebanese in
Kreuzberg; two of his Lebanese countrymen were seriously wounded.

|'The Lebanese have meanwhile become our best customers," say the agents sarcasti-

cally. Since the narcotics department mashed two large Turkish gangs 2 years ago,
the Arabs are the best at the deadly heroin business. "Only a tiny fraction of the
foreigners in Berlin are involved in the drug trade," says Criminal Police Director

Ulber, "but the fact is that foreigners are almost always involved in the lost im-
portant cases.”

The drug dealers' part of town - which I'moved" From the Zoo Railway Station to
Schomeberg because of the numerous police raids — is firmly in the hands of the
foreigners, many of whom protect themselves by applying for asylum. Complain the
police: "He don't understand why they don't speed up the processing on these
pmple's applications for asylum, so they can be deported quickly."

The police are also less and less delicate in the mini-war against this dirty busi-
ness: "Hold still or I'll knock your head off!" is the frequalt command when the
snail-scale dealers are being searched. Important pieces of information are also
sometimes passed along to the state's attorney outside the official files in order
to protect sources - not legal, but legitimate, say the agents. The authorities

sometimes offer rewards as ucll - in exchange for "absolute confidmtiality":
"Five-figure sums are conceivable,"

The agents thus achieve spectacular successes. They found 2 kilogrns of heroin on
Oezergun and an accomplice. 0n [ukugust the criminal police had ferreted out a
record 4.1 kilograms in too apartments in the Tiergartm and Bedding districts.

Divided into individual packets, the hot merchandise would have brought the dealers
m 8.5 million on the market.

Nevertheless, “even after busts like this, the stuff is in mart supply for only a

little uhilc," says criminal police official Ulber; "unfortunately, there is always
enough in the pipeline to take its place."

_/_Irticle by Morten Fyhn: ”More Narcotics Enter Sweden Via Norway?

[l'exg7 Stockholm, 9 September. Smuggling of narcotics into Sweden via Norway is
becoming increasingly comon. This is what the Stockholm narcotics police asserts
after just having broken up two large drug gangs and arrested 33 suspects.

One of the principals has admitted that he has dealt in 20 kilograms of amphetamines
during the past 2 years for a sales value estimated at 8 million Swedish kroner. The
two gangs are suspected of having sold all types of narcotics for a value of about

10 million.

During the police action of recent days the police seized, anong others, a person
carrying 85 grams of heroin. The person is suspected of being a courier for the
gangs. In his pocket he had a ferry ticket from Copenhagen to Oslo.

In the opinion of the pol ice, Swedish customs officials in Helsingborg and other ports
in southern Sweden have now becrne so effective that narcotics smugglers to an
increasing degree prefer to travel via Oslo on theirway frcn the Cmtinent to the
Swedish market. Large amounts of the narcotics smugoled into Sweden originate in
Belgium and the Netherlands and reach Sweden via Copenhagen and 0510-

lt is known that the transport by couriers via 0310 is cheaper. The risk of being

caught in the ports of southern Sweden has increased, according to the police. The
so—called risk supplement for narcotics transport fran Denmark to Sweden without the
detour via Norway is estimated at 35,000 Swedish kroner per kilogram of amphetamine.

The narcotics police of Stockholm say to AFTENPCBTBN that it is very difficult to
estimate the amounts of narcotics that go to Sweden via Norway.

Better Nordic Narcotics Cooperation

Stockholm (NTB-T’l‘). In the opinion of the Swedish social minister Karin Soder the
Nordic countries must cooperate better in the struggle against drug addiction.

The Nordic social ministers will meet at her initiative at the end of this year to
discuss narcotics problems in the North.
"In our opinion the problems have worsened during the past few years. The trade in
narcotics across Orcsund has increased," says State Secretary Ake Pettersson of the

Swedish ministry of Social Affairs.

The Swedish side regards with disquiet the fact that Danish legislation is more
liberal than that of Sweden. The question of joint legislation is to be discussed

at the meeting .

Social workers from Norway, Sweden, and Finland have worked for a couple of years
in Copenhagen, and experience gained in their activities are to be discussed.

Another question is border control of travelers between the Nordic countries.

OLSO NARCONCS-SBCTION POLICE CHIEF Hams 0P DEB SITUATION
Oslo ARBBIDERBLADET in Norwegian 21 Sep 81 p 11
ﬁrticle: "Huuse Wants More Money?

5-er Unless the pol ice and customs authorities receive the funds necessary to
strengthen the fight on the drug dealers the social and health administrations will
in the future be faced with a hopeless situation, says Police Inspector Arne House,
chief of the Oslo police narcotics section, to NTB.

Immediately prior to the election the government decided to spend 22 aillion kroner
this year for efforts by the police and wstoms authorities and in the social sector.

"1 think this amount is much too small, and I should like to point out that the Oslo
police as early as the beginning of this year asked for several millim kroner. To
date. we have received no reply, except that the matter is under consideration. Time
is working against us.

"In several actual cases lack of appropriations has directly hampered investigations
because of poor technical equipment for surveillance of persms suspected of dealing
in large amounts of narcotics," says Huuse.

Tied to the Office

House points out that many able policemen still perform typical office functions.
They could immediately be freed for work in the field if appropriations were available
for hiring more clerical help.

"In my opinion the extraordinary appropriations allotted to the various police
departments in the country for investigating narcotics cases must be regarded as
peanuts. The money is spent in a day or two,“ says Huuse.

In addition to the work of catching the big narcotics dealers the police also seek to
clear up other crime, such as, for example, crime for gain and prostitution.

"Here we shall expand our cooperation with other sections of the Oslo pol ice. Receivers
of stolen goods must learn that they are directly helping to finance the drug market,”
says House. In House's opinion there is a tendency to consider the drug pusher hilt-
self an addict, a “victim" who really should not be punished.

62
Facades Bought

'1 see nothing mitigating in financing one's own need for drugs by selling them,
thereby creating new addicts,“ says Huuse. "It should not be forgotten that former
street pushers have managed to amass so much capital that they have been able to
buy 'facades' as owners of restaurants. flower shops, record stores, and the like.

The men behind the scenes with the facades of rich men are also members of the addict
group."

Huuse says the narcotics police now direct a maximum effort toward pushers and warns
of strong reactions to those of then who are themselves addicts.

Drivers Licenses Confiscated

“Drivers licenses will be canceled and those who have not obtained licenses will
be denied the opportunity to take the driving test. Drug pushing may also affect
the granting of licenses of other kinds. Autalobiles used in drug sales may be
confiscated. a matter in which thus far we have been lax," says Huuse.

He stresses that this does not mean a shift in priorities in police efforts to combat
the drug evil. The big dealers in narcotics will still be the first priority, but
because the police have received increased funds it can now attack the addict milieu
to a greater degree than formerly.

POLICE masr rm ma SHUGGLING HEROIN mu NETHERLANDS
Oslo mammmar in Norwegian 2 Oct 81 p l0
[Article by Kathrine Kjelland]

[Text] Ten young men. aged lb to 22, have been charged with larger narcotics
dealings after police in Drobak confiscated heroin worth about 300,000 kroner.
Five of the young men were jailed Saturday, charged with offenses under the pro-
fessional paragraph. The heroin arrived by mail from The Netherlands last week.

At the end of August last year a man from As was jailed for possessing ampheta-
mines worth 30,000 kroner. Intense police surveillance of this man's circle of
acquaintances led to charges being brought against another 10 men for narcotics

dealing last Saturday.

Five of the suspects were jailed in different prisons in the 0stiand area and
are not allowed to receive letters or visits. A 22-year-old from Ski was placed
in custody for 6 weeks while the other four are in for a weeks. The police have
reason to believe the gang maintained a high living standard through the sale of
narcotics. The 10 suspects don't have any regular jobs.

Raid

The police cracked down on the gang last Friday when five of thu accused were
brought in for delivering the heroin package. Earlier that week the police had
found the heroin package by going through the mail. They had replaced some of the
heroin with a harmless substance and allowed the package to be sent on to the
addressee. The recipient of the package denied having any knowledge of the

heroin shipment. He lives with his parents in a house on Ski.

Four of the accused had made several trips abroad recently. They switched from
rented cars to plane in keeping up their contacts in Holland.

The Drobak police revealed that the activity has been going on for at least half

a year. None of the accused admitted that the heroin was intended for resale.
Drug abuse on the part of the suspects ranges from "minor habit" to serious abuse.

64
Five Deaths

Twenty-seven policemen from Oppegard, Ski, As and Polio took part in the surveil-
lance. Investigators from the narcotics division and the canine patrol in Oslo
assisted in the raid Friday.

In recent years the Follo police have conducted an intense investigation in the
narcotics sector. So far this year five deaths in the district can be attributed
to drugs. Police chief Thor Aasvold told ARBEIDERBLADET that the narcotics situa-
tion in F0110 is cause for concern. The district is isolated and has an exposed
location. It looks as if narcotics dealers are retreating from Oslo and feel
safer in the "province." At the same time they are geographically close to the
Oslo narcotics market.

BOQ<S DISGJSS YCJJTH DRUG ENVIRMNT

Oslo APTENPOSTEN in Norwegian 21 Sep 81 p 2
{ﬁrticle by Liv Hegna: “Narcotics Hell Described by Professionalsj7

(Text? The narcotics hell is still spreading. An increasing number of families today
live in the fear that a son or daughter will be swallowed up in it. The figures for
Oslo show that one out of five youths has been in contact with narcotics one or more
times before the age of 21. Mortality among drug addicts is five times as high as

in the rest of the population, and suicide frequency 60 times higher. The culmination
of drug misuse hoped for in the middle 19705 did not appear. The countermeasures of
the authorities have not been adequate.

Despite the efforts made by the policy and customs authorities it is not difficult
for young people, in particular in the cities, to obtain drugs. In his book ‘Drug
Abuse,“ psychiatrist Nils Retterstol presents clear figures showing a constantly
lower first-time drug use. In 1970 it was over 17 years, while today it is close to
155 years, and while 10 years ago twice as many boys as girls tried drugs, the ratio
during the 1977-79 period was five to four. Also, a so—called hard core of addicts
has developed, addicted to heroin or the like and with a strong six of criminality.

Is society powerless in the face of the problem? No, thinks Retterstol, pointing
out by referring to a number of studies that there is cause for cautious optimism.
Many alternative treatments have been offered youth, such as treatment in collectives.
Better methods have been developed in vagrancy sections, psychiatric hospitals and
clinics. As concerns the latter the question of compulsory omnnittnent is a central
problem. Thus far there has been no legal authority for this in Norway, the chief
argument against it by professionals being that patients who lack motivation for
improvement destroy the treatment milieu and that there are not adequate treatment
facilities. Retterstol points out, however, that the patients' motivation is most
often characterized by hostile feelings. Retterstol discusses the field rather
thoroughly, and his book ought to be obligatory reading for politicians who will
probably have to deal with the problem inthe near future.

in another book from the same publisher, “Collectives, Everyday Life and Effects,‘

three authors, Helge Waal, Arne Schance Andresen, and Anne Karine Kaada, present in
detail the experiences of the first 85 youths and 25 employees of a treatment collective.

66
Drug addicts are largely recruited from nilieus where there are no contacts and who
primarily need a new life style involving challenges, conflicts. demands, and dif-
ficulties, along with rewards their social environment cannot give them. Experiences
from the collectives described in the book indicate that these things are real
compensation and an alternative or supplement to other forns of treatment for youth.

A program to find work for youths has been carried on for about a decade in this
country. The reason for its establishment was rising concern over the many youths

who drift around in the streets of central Oslo, the Palace Park, and the subway
stations.

In her book, "Along the Street,” psychologist Gro Th. Lie points out that a confidence
gap exists between youth workers and politicians in connection with search-out youth
work. In a well written and easily understood way she contributes to bridging this
gap and makes clear why field workers and youth workers must identify more with

their clients than with the police and the rest of society. If we understand Gro

Th. Lie correctly she thinks a development is under way toward increased understanding
in all groups of each others tasks and special ways of working.

BRIEFS

OSLO NARCOTICS PLAN PROPOSI--"Now it's up to the politicians to make a move,"
Hakon Formo Berntsen told ARBBIDERBLADET. The Health Council has unanimously
backed the comprehensive plan to combat narcotics that Porno Berntsen came up with
earlier this fall. The plan involves 300 jobs and has a cost framework that over
5 years will rise from 10 million kroner in the first year to 50 million in the
fifth year. Some of the money will come from programs that already exist in the
Oslo area. The new measures include two overnight homes, 10 family homes, eight
treatment homes and an acute-care home. "'lho plan is based on the needs of young
people and the expressed desire of the police to do something about the drug prob-
lem. It is based on Storting Report 138 and a resolution by the Oslo Board of
Aldermen." said Formo Berntsen. "I am also very happy that the Health Council
supported the plan," he added. "All objections about this being unrealistic in
these economically hardpressed times will be refuted." 80 said chief. medical offi-
cer Frederik Hellbye. The Oslo Health Council recommended that the city of Oslo
provide 6 million kroner in 1982 to get the plan started. "in the long run it is
more economical on the national level to invest heavily in combatting narcotics now
than not to do so," the Health Council maintained. [By Erik R. Sandoy] [Text]

POLICE BEGIN NATIONWIDE CRACKDOUN 0N STREET DRUG SALES
Stockholm DAGBNS NYHETER in Swedish 25 Sep 81 pp 1, 5
[Article by Per Sjogren]

[Text] Later this fall, police throughout the country will begin a crackdown on
street sales of drugs. The goal is to destroy the final link in the drug-sales
chain. The campaign will be conducted from 15 October to 15 December this year
and from 1 April to 1 June next year. Municipal and traffic police will also be
used as reinforcements in the campaign.

"we want to destroy the market," National Police Commissioner Holger Romander
said.

An outline of the campaign was presented during a press conference at the
National Police Board on Thursday. The participants included the top police
commissioner, Holger Romander, and his closest associates.

The campaign will cover the entire country. Narcotics police in each province
and in Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Halmo, with the help of other police groups,
will intensify the battle against drug sales to users for at least one month.
After 1 July next year the results of the campaign will be evaluated. The
national police board will then decide how to proceed.

The provincial police chiefs and the police commissioners in the three largest
cities are organizing the campaigns within their own region, but according to
instructions from the National Police Board the campaign is to be directed
primarily against street sales and other sales direct to the user. Police should
devote special attention to places that are known hangouts for pushers and users.

The campaign is directed against both pushers and users. of ten, but not always,
the pusher is also a user. 0n 1 January 1980 chief public prosecutor Hagnus
SJoberg stated that the time had come for prosecutors to get tough against drugs.
All drug possession is criminal and police will act according to this premise
during the crackdown.

Chief of the National Criminal Police, Tommy Lindstrom, anticipates several
consequences of the campaign:

69
Police hope to destroy the final link in the sales chain, sales to the drug user.

If this is successful, police believe that the intermediate links in the chain
will become sellers. At present, the people at intermediate levels are anonymous.
If they become sellers, the police will have a greater chance of identifying them.

One goal of the campaign is to reduce the supply of drugs in the country. Many
pushers in the final sales link are themselves drug users. If the supply is
reduced, they will take more for themselves and there will be less to sell.

The reduced supply makes the drugs more expensive. According to police,
experience shows that when this happens more drug users seek treatment.

A reduced supply of drugs also means that fewer people run the risk of being
caught up in drugs. The police hope that this is true.

Police also believe that the crime that accompanies drug use will also decrease.
This includes theft and fraud to obtain money for drugs. The reasoning behind

this is that many people will stop using drugs and the incentive to obtain money
will then diminish.

The Social Affairs Ministry and social authorities have been advised of the
upcoming campaign, but no more treatment facilities will be created for any
additional drug users who may seek treatment.

Tommy Lindstrom and others maintain that treatment is not a police matter. They
only hope that the most serious cases will be treated first if treatment facil-
ities actually experience an increased load.

Up to now, narcotics police have devoted most of their attention to big-time
drug traffickers.

"We have broken up several organizations," Tommy Lindstrom said. The statistics
show:

Year gepgrts number of confiscations
1979 6,904 3,569

1980 10,806 5,772

1981 6,990 3,271

(6 months)

The number of cases involving the police increased dramatically since the chief
public prosecutor made his statement. Tommy Lindstrom does not believe that

drug abuse has increased by a similar amount. The police have begun to work
harder.
The logical course to follow now is to attack drugs on the street. In the entire
country 316 policemen are working full-tine against drug abuse. To combat drugs
on the street, help is needed from criminal, Iunicipal, and traffic police.

During the time the camaign is underway, traffic police are not as busy as they
normally are.

Criminal police must postpone other aesimenta. hmicipal police nuat aiaply
concentrate more on drug investigations during their norml work.
