[Text]

VER the past more than 30 postwar
years, Japan has achieved a rate of
economic grth that has been the

mostspectacularintheworld. Growthin
the soealled “heavy-and-chernical indus-
tries," such as steel. shipbuilding. automo-
biles and chemicals, and in the electronics
industry has been unparalleled. In another
important basic industry. however, Japan has
lagged psinlully behind other advanced coun-
tries—petroleum, and in particular. the up-
stream processes of exploration and develop-
merit.

The history of Japan‘s oil development is
relatively short, the oil industry in Japan
having taken shape only a little more than l0
years ago. During these 10 years, the Min-
istry of International Trade and Industry has
pursued policies for oil development, both
domestically and outside the country. prem-
ised on the relative weakness of the Japanese
upstream sector due to the overwhelming
emphasis given to the downstream operations
of refining and sales.

ln I967. the Comprehensive Energy Re-
search Council, an advisory organ to the
Minister of International Trade and Indus! ry.
with an eye to overseas oil development.
recommendw a target of 30 percentasthe
proportion of domestic oil demand which
was to be met by crude oir explored and
developed by Japanese companies. Attain~
ment of a stable supply of this dimension was
considered to be both desirable and feasible.

In the autumn of the same yearl
response to the Research Coo
mendations, the Oil Develop
Corp was set up. ﬁnanced by

assistance to overseas oil deve

The oil industry consists

tional oil majors and most
leading oil companies engage i
upcrzitiuii which includes both upstream and
downstream activities. from exploration and
development to reﬁning and sales. Japanese
oil companies. however, with only a few
exceptions, engage mostly in downstream and
not upstream operations. Generally speak.
ing, downstream operations require consider-
able capital and a high-risk investment.
Most oil companies elsewhere, therefore, try
to balance their operations by channeling
earnings from the downstream to the up-
stream sector. It is only in this way that
risky Operations like the oil industry can
survive.

However, because of a separation of these
operations, Japanese oil development com-
panies have no reﬁning or sales facilities.
This results in some basic drawbacks. The
greatest of these is that because individual
Japanese companies cannot raise funds for
oil development overseas themselves. they
depend on industry at large to set up separate
companies for each development project, in
what is called a “one-project-one-company”
formula.

This formula, where risk is conﬁned to a
speciﬁc project, has the following problems:

First, it hampers the long-term develop-
ment of companies capable of raising such
funds in the future.

Second. because the perspective is limited
to immediate projects, it hampers the growth
of companies capable of conducting elfective
investment on a worldwide basis. _

Third. scarce engineers and technicians are
mobilized for each speciﬁc project. causing a
shortage in their numbers.

Fourth, if the company is successful in
striking oil, it can survive, but if not, it either
has to dissolve or at least hwome dormant, as
a result of which any experience gained from
a particular project is unable to be put to use
in other projects.

Against this background, eight so-called
“integrated companies" have been set up,
composed of major banking groups and
trading ﬁrms, charged with playing a central
role in oil development projects However,
although they have the necessary ﬁnancial
backing. these companies do not have enough

reasons for thla decline.

First, soaring oil prices have. prompted
energyvsaving eﬁorts in both the industr'nl
and non-industrial sectors.

Swond,tueuseofalternativeenergyhas
been accelerated: Theswitehtocoal hasbeen
particularly marked in such fuel-consuming
industries as steel. cement, paper and pulp.
Kerosene oil is also being replaad by service
gas or electricity.

Third. while the overall economic growth
rate has risen steadily. the oil~consuming
industries such as steel. chemicals and cement
have cut down on production sharply becauu
of excessive inventories.

'1hetirstandsecondreasonscan beexpected
to have a continued and growing eﬂ’ect.
Taking this into account. in May 1981 MIT!
worked out an oil supply plan for ﬁscal
l98l-85. which represented a sharp down-
ward modiﬁcation of the previous oil import
plan. According to this revised plan. approved
by the Oil Council, Japan's total imports of
crude oil in 1985 are set at 331 million kilo-
litera or 5.71 million barrels per day (1 barrel
equals 159 liters), an amount much smaller
tho the 6.3 million barrel target declared at
the Tokyo Summit in June 1979.

Nevertheless. there is little sign of Japan's
oil situation improving in the immediate
Mute because the crude oil developed by
Japanese companies overseas or domestically
accounts for such a small portion of the total
Japanese demand.

Japan's ﬁrst oil development overseas was
undertaken by Arabian Oil Co. Ltd. in I960.
in the neutral areas of Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait and in the sea 00' Khalji. in 1961. a
total of L45 million tons of crude oil was
shipped to Japan from these fields. This was
an exceptionally successful example in the
highly risky industry of oil development.
The ﬁrst oil well produced l.000 kiloliters ol'
ﬁrst-grade oil a day, and all the succecding
wells were similarly sowessful. Encouraged
by the success of the Khafji oil fields, more
and more Japanese companies laurvhed oil
development projects overseas.

eight “integrated companies" number about

percent for overseas operations and no more
than 80 percent for operations in the seas

made through the acquisition of equity, and
ﬁnancing terms are set at an annual interest
rate of more than 6.75 percent for a period
of no more than 18 years. Investment and
ﬁnancing as of the end of I980 amounted
to $500.6 billion «232 billion for invest-
ment and \‘268.6 billion for ﬁnancing; IF4519
billion for overseas operations and $26.1
billion for those in Japan's surrounding seas).
So far l6 companies have succeeded in the
exploration and development of oil and either
are already producing or are in the process
of preparing to produce oil with the assistance
of investment or ﬁnancing from the corpora-
tion. Six other companies, also with the
corporation's ﬁnancial support. have disp
coveted crude oil or gas and are studying the
feasibility of production. and 3! other com.
panies are in the process of exploration with
the corporation's backing.

In December I955, the Oil Resources
Development Co. was set up as a state
company. but was disbanded in 1967 when
the Oil Development Corp. was established;
its business was therealler taken over by the
business department of the corporation. In
1910. the company was reinstated as the
Oil Resources Development Co.

Thecompany's predecessor had launched
ocean exploration in l960. as the ﬁrst Jap-
anese company to do so. and an oil ﬁeld was
discovered in the Japan Sea of! Akita in
northern Japan. In 197! and later, the
company discovered Japan's ﬁrst large-
scnle oil and gas ﬁelds in the sea oﬂ' Agn.
Niigsta Prefecture. This exploration was
conducted jointly with ldemitsu Oil Develop.
ment, through Japan Sea Oil Resources
Development. Production commenced in
1976.

in September l94l. Teiltoltu Oil Co.
Ltd. was established with 50 percent govern-
ment capital. Ptewar Teikoltu Oil was
an entirely upstream company and incor-
porated the mining operations of a number
of oil companies. In 1950. it bean opera-
tion as a private company. Its ocean

According to the announcement of the

(1) to begin fullvscale produaion of oil and

complete an LNG plant by the end of 1987.
Under this agreement. Japan will receive 300
tons of LNG and 50 percent of-the crude
oil produced for 20 years.

in May l9”. the New Japan Oil Develop-
ment Co. Ltd., an aﬁliate of ldemitsu

Probably because of these successful ex-
amples. the outloolt for oil development in

Japan has bwome brighter. Awarding to a
report made by the Petroleum Producers
which is poorly endowed with natural re
sources and has to conduct exploration and
development under severe natural conditions
overseas.

The Petroleum Producers Association has
calculated that in order for Japan to secure
300.000 bbl/day of oil of its own production
by 1990. an investment of l1"].2 trillion
would be required How to raise such vast
mods for exploration and development is a
big headache.

“ﬂiesecondproblemistheissueol‘per-
sonnel. praticularly the raising of exploration
and development engineers. The Oil Engi-
neering Association has a membership of
about 900 oil engineers. but of these only
about 100, with more than to years experience
in exploration and development. are capable
of negotiating with their counterparts over-
seas. This situation contrasts with the
international majors which retain 400 or
500 oil engineers each.

At present there are about 70 oil develop-
ment companies in Japan, but only a few of
these retain their own engineers. Instead.
whentheycometothestageoftrialemcava-
tion and production, they seek help from
engineers of the Oil Resources Development
and Teilroku Oil companies. This is because
oil companies which engage only in upstream
operations have weak management founda-
tions and are not strong enoudt to raise
their own engineers. This situation in turn
discourages capable engineers from study-
ing exploration and development techniques.

To cope with this problem it is important
to increase the number of courses oﬁ‘ered on
this subject at universities. As another
means of raising such engineers, the Japan
National Oil Corp. has begun to send prom-
ising young Japanese engineers to interna-
tioaal oil majors for training.

Third. it will be next to impossible to re-
inforce the upstream sector if nothing is done
about its present separation from downstream
activities. As it is, Japan's oil industry,
heavily tilted toward downstream opera-
tiona. may not deserve the name of oil indus-

oil wholesalers operating moatly in the down-
stream rector. have set up wholly owned
subsidiariea operating in the upatnam aeo-
tor.
lastly. oil development has much to do
with international cooperation. Oildevelop-
ment by the advanced countries in prewar
yeara was based on colonialism. Since the
end of the war. there have been drastic
changer. Today Japan haa friendly rela-

Japan's peace policy is being shakes by a
silicon chip no more than I centimeter in
area. Japan lost the Second World War;
something like 3 million people lost their lives
and the was brought to all parts of East Asia

a calamity from which it has barely been able
to recover. Alter the war. reﬂecting sincere

introspection and via the medium of her new
constitution. Japan determined to make her-
self unconditionally a power for peace. The
Diet passed a resolution incorporating three
principles concerning the export of weapons
of war which basically pledged Japan never
to engage in such export whatever the recipi-
ent country. Increasingly, however. modern
warfare has taken on the aspect of a war of
electronics. Electronics technology, center-
ing on the silicon chip (semi-conductor). has
become the center of attention for its potential
:nrlrtary applications. Japan. whose present
economic successes and social stability have
worked to the beneﬁt of her most friendly
nation. the United States of America. is now
being formally requested by that country to
supply her with silicon chips for military
purposes. However. the problem is that
complying with such a request. even from
America, would not only be in conﬂict with
the three principles but would also be incom~
pntible with the spirit of Japan's constitution.
Thus. a situation has arisen whereby one
wonders if it is possible, on the one hand. to
continue to improve the economic circum-
stances by exporting products and technol-

9

ogy which in large part involve electronic
and. on the other. without endangering her
alliance with the Western Powers. which is c!
paramount importance. to refuse to cooperate
with any country in a war or to provide it
with materials for war. Japan is suddenly
placed at the mercy ofthe specter of“elet>
tronia."

The fact that the US. government has
formally requested that Japan cooperate in
the application of clectronia to the military
held and in the development and production
of weapons became public knowledge in June
l98l. High-ranking ofﬁcials of the Foreign
Ministry and Defense Ministry say that
Americahaseapressedaninterestinreoeiving

speed processors for computers. laser tech-
nology and facsimile communications.

At ﬁrst industrial circle tended to doubt
the accuracy of this report. Ouchi Atsuyoshi,
vice president (and in charge of semi-
conductors) of Nippon Electric (NRC).
Japan‘s leading producer of communi~
cations equipment and semiconductors and
prominent on a world scale, said, “Japan’s
semi-cenductor industry is wellsdvanced in
production and particularly mass-production
techniques. but lags far behind the United
States in basic research and technology.
Moreover. when it comes to rigorously strict
military specitatinns for integrated circuits
there is no way that Japan can comply. If
the us. government really imagines that

military technology exists in Japan that it
doesn‘t have at home. then there‘s some
mistake somewhere."

Tanatsugu Tomio. vice president of
Toshiba Corp. and a previous chairman of
the Japan Ordnance Association, expressed
a similar opinion: “if we were to spend
enough time and money to that end, Japan
probably could produce conventional weap-
onry. but evenso not without licensed tedi-
nology from the States. For instance, Japan
is far behind in military aircraft."

However, when one talks with people in
industrial circles. it soon becomes clear that
a number of electronic parts developed by
Japan for industrial uses most certainly have
potential military applications. "That‘s ab-
solutely true," says Kobsyashi Dniyu, presi-
dent of Fujitsu Ltd—pulling out his chest a
little. Fujitsu is Japan's leading computer
matter with annual sales well ahead of those
of I.B.M.'s Japanese subsidiary, Nippon
1.8M. Kobayashi adds: “The problems of
using a computer system for military purposes
are exactly the same as for civilian purposes.
And it may well be that computer technology
in Japan. which has the most-advanced
banking on-line system in the world, is ahead
of the United States. From that point of
view, it isn't at all surprising that the US.
government should thinlr of using the accu-
mulatcd expertise of Japanese companies for
military purposes. In fact, Fujitsu itself has
several times received direct requests for
cooperation from the US. Defense Depart-
mcntl"

it may be that Kobayashi speaks with such
conﬁdence because he is one of the few Japa-
nese to have visited the North American Air
Defense Command (NORAD) facility in
Colorado. NORAD is the facility which,
with one word from the US. president over
the hot line. can plunge the world into the

Japan is in a dilemma: how v. facile the
production of such parts end er.uiprnent,
which have such important civilian uses, with
the concept of the three principles regarding
export of armaments—retaining the idea of
Japan as a nation of peace, while at the same
time pursuing the other national policy of
promotion of exports in circumstances where
the products in question have outstandingly
high added value.

A notable recent development has been
attempts on the part of certain members of
business circles to modify the concept of
“peace" to lit the realities of contemporary
circumstances. In August I981, at the well-
known resort of Karuizawe, a forum was
organized by the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), a body which
brings together some 800 leading business
organizations plus such industrial groupings
as the Japan Iron and Steel Federation and
the Federation of Bankers Associations of
Japan. During the proceedings, Tanabo
Bun‘ichiro. president of Mitsubishi Corp..
openly called for a removal of the restric-
itons on the export of arms, and there were
many present who supported his demand.

In the past it has been only a few, such
as Nagano Shigeo. chairman of the Japan
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. and

Fujitsu Ranks First

Sales in the information processing related area of the top 10 Japanese computer
companies during FY-80 totaled more than 1.6091 trillion yen. This was roughly
lS-percent increase over the previous year's sales. There was no change in the
makeup of the top 10 companies in the information processing area. but among them
some experienced a sales decrease and some, a 59-percent sales increase, and this
very wide divergence in rates of increase may be considered a characteristic
feature of the FY—80 record.

At the same time. Fujitsu. which had wrested the top spot from Japan IBM during
FY-79. greatly surpassed its sales total over Japan IBM of 2.5 billion yen in
FY-79 and expanded this margin more than 17 times to 43.8 billion yen in PY-80 to
reconfirm its top position. The six Japanese companies which increased sales by
double digits through skillful handling of the 0A (office automation) boom dis-
played wide differences in their FY-80 performance compared with those companies
with foreign capital which could not keep up with the changes in the market.

Three Companies Revise Computation Methods

The general outline of the FY-80 accounts of the six Japanese companies (Hitachi,
Fujitsu. Nippon Electric. Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric and Oki Electric) and four
foreign-funded companies (Japan IBM. Japan Univac. Burroughs and Japan NCR) is
given in Table l. (The figures given in this article are for sales in the informa-
tion processing related area. The standards adopted in compiling the accounts

are given on another page.)

Before coming to the order in sales. we will report here that three companies.
Toshiba. Oki Electric and Japan NCR. greatly expanded their classification of
products in the information treatment related area, that resulted in an increase
in sales in the area.

First of all. Toshiba's sales in the information processing related area had been
limited to products handled by the electronic calculator industry department. and

bank terminals of its equipment industry department and terminals of the electric
communication industry department were not included. But starting in FY-80.

the terminal equipment which was handled by these two departments was included

in the information treatment related data. Incidentally. the sales of terminal
equipment of these two departments for FY-79 totaled close to 19 billion yen. The
sales total for FY-80 based on the past computational basis was 58.5 billion yen,
which was a l6-pereent growth over the previous year. but the addition of terminal
equipment swelled this total by 21.8 billion yen for a grant total of 80.3 bil-
lion yen for the year (S9-percent increase over the preceding year).

Through FY-79. oki Electric was computing only the sales of the electronic business
machines department as the sales in the information treatment related area, but

in FY-80 it began to include measuring instruments, audio equipment. radio equip-
ment and control instruments and called the entire ensemble the information proc-
essing equipment. As a result. starting in FY-80 the total sales of electronic

business machines and measuring and control instruments are classed as informa-
tion processing related sales. when the PY-80 account was totaled only along
the lines of electronic business machines. as had been the practice in the past.
it was 69.5 billion yet, which was a 10.7-percent increase over the preceding
year. but the inclusion of measuring and control instruments swelled this total
by another 9.3 billion yen to 78.8 billion yen (25.5-percent increase over the
preceding year) for the information processing related sales.

Japan NOR stated that because "distinction between products themselves was diffi-
cult as the result of changes in business structure and electronification of
products. it decided to change the classification of products" so it abbreviated
the former "computer." "terminal equipment." "general business equipment."
"technological service." "accessory parts" and "computation center" to
"electronic calculators." "terminal equipment" and "other information equip-
ment." In the past this journal computed the sales total for the computer.
terminal equipment and computation-center. The company did not clearly show how
sales for accessory equipment. technological service and computational center
were distributed in this new system. so that comparison with the preceding
year's sales is rather nebulous. As a result. the total of the electronic cal-
culators and terminal equipment area will be treated as information processing
area sales here. Other information equipment such as electronic cash registers
were left out of this total.

Because these three companies modified their manner of computing total sales.
it should be clarified here why the sales order for FY-80 underwent a big change
in some part and why the increase in sales over the preceding year was so large.

A Look at the Order in Sales

The 10 companies with top sales are the same as before. The ranking and sales
totals for the top 10 companies are given in Table 2. There is no change in the
order of the top four companies from FY-79. but there is considerable change in
the next six companies. Toshiba. which expanded its computation basis. made the
great leap from ninth in FY-79 to fifth in FY-BO (fourth among domestic makers).
and this was the greatest change. On the other hand. if the total basis is taken
to be the same as in FY—79 as described in the Note for Table 2, this company
ranks eighth. There was no change in the rank of Oki Electric and Japan NOR.

The changes in total sales rankings from FY-76 are shown in Table 3 and Table 4.
The same names appear on these tables year after year. but their rankings change.
The rankings among the last six companies show rather large changes. What stands
out here is the trend to lower ranks of Burroughs and Japan NCR and the rise in
rank of Mitsubishi Electric.

When the sales of the top 10 companies. which totaled 1.609.196.000.000 yen. are
divided into those of domestic companies (six companies) and those of foreign-
fundcd companies (four companies). the following is the result.

The domestic companies totaled sales of l.093.579.000.000 yen and accounted for
68 percent.

The foreign-funded companies sales totaled 515.617.000.000 yen and accounted for
32 percent.

The
Differences in Extent of Sales Growth

The sales total. the rates of growth and the percentage of the sales total in
the information processing area compared to the grand sales total of the entire
company vary greatly between companies. He will first compare these companies
according to total sales.

The changes in total sales in the information processing related area starting
in FY-76 are shown in Figure 2. These companies can be clearly classified into
three levels: top-ranking Fujitsu and Japan IBM. runner-up level companies
Hitachi and Nippon Electric. and the ordinary level made up of the remaining

six companies. At the same time. there have been great changes within each level.
particularly during recent years. “here the margin in sales superiority of
Fujitsu in FY-79 was scant. it grew to sizable proportion in FY-80. At the same
time, Nippon Electric has been narrowing the gap between itself and Hitachi and
has great potential for overtaking Hitachi in FY-81 and asming second place in
the domestic picture. In this respect. Nippon Electric has. in addition to the
sales reported here, the personal computer area in the form of the Pc-8000
(about 50.000 units in FY-80 estimated at total sales of 10-30 billion yen)
which are computed in the electronic device department and not included in the
above total. so that it can be said to have surpassed Hitachi in substance.

Hhat will be watched with great interest in future is how Hitachi and Nippon
Electric fare in total sales compared to Japan IEH.

Assigning a value of 100 to the sales of each company for FY-76, the trend of
growth in information treatment related sales of each company is shown in Figure
3. This graph shows that each company has expanded greatly. and these trends
can be put into the following three categories:

More than 2 times Nippon Electric
1.5-2 times Mitsubishi. Hitachi, Oki. Fujitsu
Less than 1.5 times Japan NCR. Toshiba. Japan IEH.

Burroughs, Japan Univac

Because Toshiba changed the ACOS computer business department to the Nichiden-
Toshiba Information System (NTIS). which was set up by joint subscription with
Nippon Electric in April 1978. its expansion in sales suffered considerably. but
it has since enjoyed a very high rate of growth. Excluding Toshiba. the com-
panies which have increased less than 1.5 times over the FY-76 level are all
foreign-funded companies (four companies). These data shcw clearly the dull
business of these foreign companies.

The August 1981 issue of CONFUTOPIA carried an article in the News Desk column
entitled "Problems of Japan IBM in Expanding its Sales-Fossibility of Falling
to Fourth Rank Within a Year." This was an attempt to compare this company's
sales in Japan obtained by subtracting the export value from the total informa-
tion processing related sales. As seen in Figure 4 and Figure 5. this company
has made only a single-digit gain over the past several years (the most recent
information is that Japan IBM has set the goal of double-digit growth for FY-8l).
Viewing from the rate of growth of domestic makers. it can be said that it is
only a matter of time before there will be great changes in the rankings at the
upper level of the top 10 companies.

Fujitsu seems to havecstabllshed anunchallenged position among the domestic makers.
On the other hand. there are data predicting that Fujitsu may be surpassed by some
other companies by 1985. and these data are offered here for reference. These

are data put out by the ”.5. Martin Simpson and Company. reported in ELECTRONICS
nmgazine (lb July 1981). The data for Fujitsu, Hitachi and Nippon Electric from
among the world's principal computer makers have been extracted and reproduced

in Table 5. These figures project that Nippon Electric will run even with

Fujitsu in 1984 and then will establish a lOO—million—dollar difference in 1985.

The ‘rends in growth rates in information processing related sales with respect to
tote. company sales for the different companies are shown in Table 6. The three
companies which altered the computation basis for their sales figures (Toshiba.
Oki ectric and Japan NCR) showed large growth rates in 1980, which was only
natural. No large changes are seen in the other companies. The percentage of

the total sales accountable to the infomation processing related sales area
during FY-BO is as shown in this table.

Two companies. Oki Electric and Japan NCR. greatly enhanced the rate of their
sales in the information processing related area with respect to the entire
company's total sales volume during FY—Bl. Toshiba also has entered fifth rank
among the top 10 companies. and it similarly enhanced its image as a company
with high dependence on information processing related area sales.

Exports and Trends of Companies Not Ranked

Here we present the records of exports in computer related equipment by the major
companies starting in FY-76 (see Figure 7).

Sales in the information processing related areas of companies other than the
previously discussed top 10 are shown in Table 7 (please refer to the top 10 0A
makers rankings in Part II on the Office Automation Industry for office equipment
related items). It is seen that a considerable gulf exists between these com-
panies and the lowest member of the top 10. Japan NCR. vith total sales of 48.2
billion yen.

Basis for Estimating Information Processing Related Sales of 10 Computer Companies

Information processing related sales account for all the sales of Japan IBM.
Japan Univac and Burroughs. The announced values in the information processing
related area are given for the six domestic companies. Three companies--Tosh1ba.
Oki Electric and Japan NCR--announced they had altered the basis of their sales
tabulation for FY-SO (the breakdown for these companies was given in the computer
section). Some companies include personal computer and numerically controlled
equipment while others do not. Some companies report the account sales to JECC
as their sales total, while others report only rental (or lease) income as their
sales values. Because of these differences. there is some lack of uniformity.
There are also differences in the designation of the fiscal year. and comparison
on exactly the same basis is not possible. As a result. these are presented
merely as reference material.

This company, which celebrated 45 years of business on 20 June 1980. began expan-
sion of its office automation business in 1980. Its aim is to expand its total
information equipment industry centered on computers and including office equip-
ment. In July 1980 it reorganized its electronic industry department's electronic
business headquarters into the "Electronic Computer Business Headquarters" and
"Office Business Headquarters." Then in July 1981 it abolished the two industrial
dcpnrtmcnts--the communications industry department and the electronic industry

department—-it had had for 20 years. and it is undertaking widespread organiza-
tional changes in order to cope with the 0A age. with coemumications and electron-
ics combined as a single system. Behind this reorganization is the realization
that although this company has been able to overtake Japan IBM in sales. it will

be difficult to maintain this sales edge without putting forth great effort on
the 0A front.

The main topics considered by this company from 1980 into 1981 are the following.

Change in president: At the business meeting of 26 March 1981. the decision was
made to elevate Director Takuma Yamamoto to the post of president to replace
former President Taiyu Kobayashi. who was informally appointed to be chairman
with the representing right. and this change was made on 30 June. President
Yamamoto. to whom the baton was passed by Chairman Kobayashi. who had succeeded

in overtaking IBH. has plans to bring Fujitsu to the l-trillion yen level by
1986-1985.

At the press conference during the presidential inauguration proceedings. President
Kobayashi listed three jobs he left undone as ”software unbundling reinforcement."
"business policy for the 0A age" and "revision in management systems." He

meant that software sales need to be increased. that integration of communica-
tions and electronics is necessary to enhance the image of Fujitsu for the 0A

age and that the company needs to revise management system for the 0A age.
Coincident with the ascent of President Yamamoto. large organizational changes
along such lines were put into effect.

On market: The marketing of the OASYSIOO.Japaneae word processor in May 1980
was a specific sign of this company's switch from a data processing specialty
company to an OA system integrated maker. In August 1981. the popular model
OASYS 100 J costing 1.5 million yen was added to its list.

In another direction. this company marketed its 2-million-yen AA 20-second
deciphering C III specification facsimile and switched its facsimile sales
strategy from system oriented (high class) to popular low-priced units. This
new organization for DA product sales and the office computers which it retained
from the past is the 0A Equipment Sales Promotion Headquarters (comprised of

the Office Computer Sales Promotion Department. Facsimile Sales Promotion Depart-
ment. OASYS Sales Promotion Department) which was established in June 1980. This
new organization is theparent of the Fujitsu Office Equipment (loo-percent funded
by Fujitsu) which was established on 1 July 1981.

This new company plans to expand its list of 70 office computers. 117 OASYS and
63 facsimile retail outlets to 100. 200 and 80 outlets. respectively. in 1981.

Personal computers: In May 1981. the Semiconductor Industry Headquarters mar-
keted the first personal computer. "FUJITSU MICRO 8." as the first Fujitsu
entry in this field. The Personal Computer Sales Promotion Department of the
Semiconductor Business Promotion Department took charge of the sales and plans
to enter into single—sales type compurtmented sales. At about the same time.
the Parts Industry Headquarters initiated DEM production of the personal com-
puter BUBCOH 80. based on the design specifications of the Systems Formulate
Company. This company is also pushing plans to market personal computers

produced by its Computer Industry Headquarters and Office Industry Headquarters
in the fall of 1981.

M series: The topmost machines were added to the M series general-use computer
(Hay 1981). They are the M-380, a 15 HIPS machine. which has maximum 50 percent
capacity over the IBM 3081. and the closely coupled multiprocessor version H-382.
The processing capability is such that the H-380 has 2.1-2.5 times the capacity
of the M—ZOO, and the H—382 has 3.5-6.5 times the capacity of the H-200. These
systems use two types of buffer memory between the CPU and main memory. and a
new packaging method is used.

Software: To keep up with the arrival of the software era. this company has
set out to divide the software department by type of industry and to establish
subsidiary companies out of them. It is targeting to establish roughly 100
subsidiary companies and has established various software-related companies such
as Fujitsu Financial Systems Engineering (December 1980). Fujitsu System Com-
bined Laboratory (January 1981), Fujitsu Kyushu System Engineering (July 1981)
and Fujitsu Kansai System Engineering (June 1981).

At the same time. it has started construction of a software building at its
Numazu plant with completion targeted for March 1982. It plans to shift soft-
ware technicians from its Kawasaki plant and set up a 1.300-man system.

Export: Its exports during 1980 totaled 37 billion yen. In April 1981 it
estimated that its computer exports for FY-8l would come to 40 billion yen. but
now the estimates appear destined to be widely exceeded and to reach 50 billion
yen. In addition to its OEH export to the Amdahl Company of the United States
and the Siemens Company of West Germany. sales activity of a TEE-Fujitsu joint
venture with the TRH Company of the United States has started vigorously in
FY-81.

The order situation for FACOH computers as of the end of FY-80 is shown in
Table 10. This includes 1.424 units for export. They can be broken down into
618 units for North and South America. 376 units for Asia-Oceania and £30 units
for the Near and Far East and Africa.

2. anan IBM

Japan IBM has been making public a portion of its accounts since 1976. and its
rate of growth in annual sales has remained in the single-digit range since that
time. This was only 4.3 percent during FY-80. The rate of growth since FY-76
has remained at 22.8 percent. In the meantime. the entire IBM Corporation
experienced a sales increase of 60.8 percent. During the same period, Nippon
Electric increased sales by 2.19 times, Hitachi by 1.83 times and Fujitsu by
1.59 times. The June 1981 issue of this journal. COMPUTOPIA, discusses the
problems of Japan IBM in its attempts to expand sales which the reader is
offered as reference.

Japan IBM came down to this low level of growth somewhere along the line, but
it announced that in 1981 it made preparations to increase its sales by at
least 10 percent during FY-Bl. Between 1980 and 1981. the company put into
effect various practices it had never used before in an effort to achieve this
end. The main topics are discussed below.

Elasticity in price: The major activities of Japan IBM during 1980 are listed

in Table 11. Japan IBH is undertaking a number of moves in order to revitalize
its business, and these activities have been given added impetus in FY-Bl. The
price strategy stands out. It is directed mainly at small computers and terminal
devices which have high potential rates of growth. These include reductions for
the 5256 printers (5-10 percent in rentals. 25-32 percent in sales). price
reduction in the 6955 Model B of the minicomputer series 1 (about 16 percent

in the purchase price) in January 1981; price reductions in the 3350 magnetic
disk device. 3240 magnetic tape device. and 3203 printer (15-30 percent reduc-
tion) in February; 10-25 percent reduction in IBM Systen 34. 10 percent

reduction in the 5280 dispersed data system and 15-25 percent reduction in

in June; and 20 percent price reduction in the 3250 image display system.
6-10 percent reduction in the 3370 information display system and 30 percent
reduction in other options in July.

It also announced the application of volume discounts to purchases of the
5285/5286 program type data device. the 5288 program type control device. the
5281/5282 data device. the 5222 printer and the display writer as of June 1981.
These were applied to the 5260 retail systems in September. Some of these are
reductions solely for Japan IBM. which are lower than the prices on the American
market. and this price strategy is contributing greatly to this company's
efforts to achieve the double-digit increase in sales.

0A strategy: This company has decided to put major effort into the area of 0A.
where it was late in entering the field. It will engage in an all-out revolution-
ary change in its sales and development system. It announced on 4 August 1981:
l) the establishment of a new small computer and business equipment related
product development department at its Pujizsws Laboratory, and 2) the establish-
ment of a special team under the direct control of the president to study new
sales methods. including the retail store mode. Because the product development
system which is dictated by the main company in the United States does not

match the Japanese market. the main American company gave the Japan subsidiary
authority to develop its own products for the domestic market. which is why this
new development system was started.

In addition. the change from direct sales to a retail store sales approach will
be made with the CBC products. Plans call for studies during 1981 followed by
an actual start in 1982. According to the most recent information. the Japan

636 will be completely independent from the international 686. It is planned
to triple the 636 product sales by this move.

New products include a Japanese character type display writer (Japanese word
processor), personal computer. data master and handling of the Canon facsimile
and the Hinolta coping machine.

Subsidiary companies. systemstization: Japan IBM is eyeing a sales total exceed-
ing 1 trillion yen in 5 years. The crux of this plan is the aforementioned retail
outlet system. but there are also plans for establishing subsidiary companies.
Although this is still in the talking stage. it is said that 14 subsidiary com-
panies are being planned.

The first of these is System Development (100 million yen capital). which the
government market development company established on 1 June 1981. One-year
lease contracts for the government and municipal office urket. major relaxa-
tion in penalties for lease cancellations and a special preferential treatment
such as priority delivery system which will allow a short-term delivery to
government offices will be put into effect by this new company.

While this item does not stand out. this company is greatly expanding its
utilization of outside parties in its production area in order to improve its
profitability. It is said that its Fujizawa plant already engages more than
500 firms. This is the so-called systematization.

In another direction. President Shiina said: "We will order software from out-
side companies in order to speed up product development" with respect to the
software front. This company set up its "Software Center" (about 100 people)
in Aoyama, Tokyo. centered on 88 (system engineering) development in January
1981. This will be the atrongpoint for software development to promote domestic
projects to compete with domestic makers. It plans to expand this place to a
300-man system in 2 years. On the other hand. the software would become too
expensive and lose the competitive edge if all software development were left
in the hands of IBM people, so plans are underway to let out work to outside
software houses. The greater part of the 16 subsidiary companies being planned
seems to be in the software area.

There is no question but that the subsidiary companies and subcontracting com-
panies surrounding Japan IBM. along with the aboveqmentioned sales outlets.
will be greatly increased. These subsidiary companies have the special merit
that they can be provided with flexibility not available to Japan IBM.

New movements: IBM of the United States and the Japan Telegraph and Telephone
Public Corporation agreed to a cross-license agreement (technology information

exchange) by which either party can utilize the other's patents free of charge.
This involves technology interchange between giant companies each of which has
more than 300,000 employees. It may be said that IBM squeezed itself between

the Public Corporation and electrical companies closely associated to it up to
then. President Opel [phonetic] of IBM announced that in 1981 the company will
enter into the robot industry as well as product manufacture for the biomedical

area .

3. Hitachi Limited

The companies which occupy the so-called second group. after top-ranking Fujitsu
and Japan 13H, are Hitachi Limited and Nippon Electric. As shown in Table 3.
there has been no change in the position of Hitachi as number 3 and Nippon
Electric as number 4 for the past 5 years. PY-SO was this company's 70th
anniversary. As one phase of the occasion's festivities. it is promoting an
80th decade product strategy theme policy in which all of its employees will
participate.

where 0A is concerned. the "Office Automation System Promotion Department" has
been added to the company organization. and full-fledged activities have been
initiated. In the computer business department. the following policies have
been established as the main items for FY-sl: l) reinforcing the product
development system. 2) strengthening the business-SB (system engineering)-
maintenance service system. 3) expanding sales of small computers and peripheral
terminal equipment. 4) strengthening software products and 5) expanding exports.
All-out development along these lines is planned. The following are the main
topics which were observed free FY-BO through FY-Bl.

Presidential change: President Hirokichi Yoshiyama. who was in the presidency
for 9 years after assuming the post in November 1971. will be 70 years old in
December 1981. and it was decided to take this occasion to pass the baton to
Vice President Kataushige Nita, who developed the computer business department
to its present state.

When he was director of the Kanagawa plant. which produces computers and periph-
eral equipment. in 1971. he exerted great effort to switch over computer sales
to rental of computers and put this business on the right track and thereby
place the company's business in a good financial position. for which he is well
known. This president said the attitude Hitachi will next strive for is "a
combination of the American 63 and IBM companies."

Oddly enough. President Hits was a classmate of Takuma Yamamoto. who ascended to
the presidency of Fujitsu in June. at the Second Engineering Department of the
University of Tokyo. Hhile it is to be expected that an electronics man would
be selected as president of a company such as Fujitsu. which is almost completely
a computer-oriented company. the fact that Hitachi. which is an integrated

36
ron OFFICIAL use ONLY
electrical equipment maker. breaking a past practice. selected a president who
is a heavy electric engineer from the computer industry department is being
noted with great interest both in Japan and abroad.

0A strategy: Hitachi thinks that the eighties will be an age in which the com-
puter business will require all-out technology. Just as the computer business
department borrows information from other business departments. it cannot do
without the other departments' assistance in developing products using their
computer technology. In other words, it will make it difficult to distinguish

the borderlines between computer technology area and other various business
areas.

This company takes the view that 0A is a system that consists of overall tech-
nology with computer technology as the hub. and it established its 0A System
Promotion Headquarters as an integral part of the entire organization in
August 1980. This is a scction which assembles all compsnywide technology
under the heading 0A.

In FY-81 this company is marketing various types of 0A equipment which Bitachi
exhibited at its technology exhibit during FY-80. In May, it introduced the
catchword "humanication" to consolidate the 0A equipment image and also estab-
lished a trademark. what is interesting here is the cooperative setup with
otherindustries. There was the development (in April) of a movable—type
Chinese character printer by a joint effort with Nippon Typewriter, the estab-
lishment (in June) of the "0A Research Group" for joint 0A equipment research
with the integrated commercial company Marubeni. the joint effort (in July) to
establish common input mode for a Japanese word processor with Ricoh and the 0A
equipment sales cooperation with Pentel (in July). as examples.

Software strategy: Hitachi recognizes that the top priority for an integrated
electrical maker in the eighties will be "software development strengt. " and

it is directing efforts to set up a system to implement this goal. As shown in
lele 13. this company has already set up at least 15 affiliated companies in
software related activities. More than half of these 15 companies. 8 coapanies.
were established during the 2—year period. FY—80 and 171-81. There are plans

for the Products Business Department to establish a solely 0A software company
in FY—8l. It plans to increase software companies, according to product and
business classifications.

37. Computer system design 2 September 1981

The reason for this is the rapid expansion in the application of semiconductor
technology, which has made necessary software for each individual product. The
microprocessor which has been the propulsion force has made the transition from
an 8-bit unit to a 16-bit unit and will soon make the conversion to a 32-bit
unit. This will make necessary software development on nearly the same level as
a general use computer. In other words. the integrated electrical maker will

be faced with gigantic software needs. Hitachi is shifting the nature of its
business and moving into a software-centered company in anticipation of this
period.

Export: As shown in Figure 7. Hitachi's computer exports are expanding in an
orderly manner. In addition to the out export to the National Advanced Systems
Company (NAS) of the United States. in 1980 it initiated OEH export to the BASE
Company of West Germany and the Olivetti Company of Italy. The Hitachi machines
handled by these three cospanies are as follows (the names in parentheses are
the equivalent Hitachi designations):

NAS Company: AS-9000 (ll-200R). AS-7000 (II-180)
BASF Company: BASF 7-80 (Ii-200R). BASF 7-70 (14-180). BASF 7-60 (bi-170)
Olivetti Company: on 5500 (Ii-2001!)

It is cstimated that orders from these three companies will exceed 60 units by
the end of I981.

For example. it has been said that Olivetti is good for 20 units a year. and
BASF for 40 units.

In another direction. this company is experiencing a sharp increase in computer
orders from China and has become a maker with exclusive exports to that country.
This export reached 414 units as of the end of December 1980. Very recently.
the problem of Cocoa (Coordinating Committee for Export Control) has arisen.

Mainframe computers: In February 1981 this company came out with its H-280ﬂ and
the lower-level mochinu. the M-ZéOh. to counter IBM's 3081. The 280R is a
12 MIPS. while the 260" is a 2 HIPS. What should be noted here is that it

started to ask for payment for OS (operating system) for the first time and
placed on the market 25 types of related software at one stroke.

This company's total sales for FY-80 reached 890 billion yen. and there is the
possibility that the l-trillion mark will be exceeded in PY-8l. The catch-
phrase "C & C" (Computer and Communication) was coined for its 80th anniversary
durir, FY-79. and since the catchphrase is so closely associated with NBC. NBC
was almost identified with C 8 C in PY-80. There were also some alterations
in its accounting system during FY-80. These included classifying sales accor-

ding to different departments and changing the names of departments in the fol-
lowing manner:

Wired and wireless communication were combined into "communication
equipment."

Electronic equipment became "computer and related electronic equipment.“
Electronic devices remained as is.

household electrical appliances became "home electronics and other
equipment."

This journal has placed computers and other electronic equipment under the cate-
gory information processing related sales. Names were changed, but types of
products are still the same. (Table 15)

Table 15. Computers and Other Electronic Equipment Area Products
/

Computers and other electronic equipment:
General-use computers (ACOS series). office computers, control-use com-
puters, various general-use and special-use terminals. Japanese word
processors. communications control equipment. atmospheric pollution
observation system. telemetry system. postal automation system. numeri-
cal control equipment. medical electronic equipment. data altering
and renovating equipment. ultrasonic equipment.

The following are the main activities of this company from FY-79 into FY-80.

C 8 C: The C 6 C is not simply a catchphrase but the company set up an organ
to promoLc business in the form of a "C 8 C System Headquarters“ in July 1980.
It has since been dissolved to make way for the "C a c Promotion Plan Office.
“C 8 C Business Systems Promotion Headquarters" and "C 6 C Public Systems Promo-
tion Headquarters." There is need to coordinate. give support and ayatemstize

a number of industrial groups laterally in order to promote the C 8 C industry,
and thus, the goal of the establishment of these organizations is to reinforce
the capability.

In line with this, "Santopia" showrooms (2k sites) for supporting office computer
sales which belong to the small-type information processing systems department
were changed in nature into NEG comprehensive showrooms. to include products of

ho
ma omcm. use omv
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

other departments such as facsimiles and personal computers. Eleven Santopia
showrooms were set up during FY-81. and a nationwide system of 35 sites is
established. Plans for a large-scale C 8 C comprehensive showroom (1,500
square meters) to be built at Hibiya in Tokyo were announced in July 1981, and
preparations are underway for a public opening on 10 November.

Personal computer boom: While not included in the information processing related
sales of this company, this company has become the gadgeteer of the personal
computer boom for general business use. Every executive from Chairman

Kobayashi and President Sekimoto down were mobilized for a massive demonstra-
tion on "the day the president used the computer." This was the opening wedge
and was a beautiful demonstration that brought the businessmen's attention to
personal computer, including executives of large personal computer users. The

company also sponsored personal computer lectures on the radio starting in April
1981.

The PC-8000 of the microcomputer application department of the NEC semiconductor
division was the showpiece of NBC personal computer. but 1981 saw this product
being joined by a number of other companions. First of all. the Small Informa-
tion Processing Systems Department. which handle: office computer, put on the
market business-use personal computer NBC System 20/25 in May 1981. This was
followed by the appearance of the N5200 Model 05. which was marketed under the
name of personal terminal by the Terminal Equipment Department in July. This
resulted in the company's personal computer business becoming a three-equipment
system involving three departments. In September 1981. the PC-8000 became part
of the family joined by the higher—class model PC-8800 and the lower-class model
PC-6000.

Export: Nippon Electric has a goal of increasing its computer exports fivefold
over than of FY-80. to 75 billion yen in FY-86. It newly established an
"Information Processing Overseas Business Promotion Headquarters" in January
1981 as an organizational aid in this direction. Then. in April of this year.
it newly set up an overseas department within its Information Processing
Government and Municipal Office System Department. thereby consolidating its
computer business directed at governmental offices in foreign countries. This
company has put its strength into the computer front. where exports have been
lagging in comparison with communications equipment. and at the same time. it

is aiming at expanding and establishing its c 8 c concept and product sales
overseas .

The company initiated export of its personal computer PC-8001 in March 1981.
Then in July it entered into an agreement with the American Burroughs Company
to supply production technology for the OCR.

Mechntronics: C a C. the coupling of computers and communications. corresponds
to what other companies call 0A. but during 1981 this company also began to
take an all-out posture in the area called mechatronics. In 1981. it entered
into a technological agreement for the purpose of joint development with the
Japax Company, which is the top maker in the line of electric spark machine,
and redirected strength to the car electronics area. In September 1981. it
announcedthenew series NEDAC 2-30 in the area of NC (numerically controlled)
equipment and immediately afterwards announced its entry into the industrial
robot area. These mechatronics efforts feature the introduction of optical
communications technology. which is this conpany's forte. in the various areas.
In this respect. the company is considering mechatronics as one phase of the
"C 6 C."

ACOS 250: The small general-use computer. ACOS 250 was put on the market in
March 1979. shipments were started in July of the same year and shipments had
totaled 1,000 units by June 1981. This company reinforced the performance of
the ACOS 250 in July 1981 with the aim of greatly renewing the sales records.
In addition. the ACOS 750 and 650 are introduced in June 1981 as new additions
to the ACOS series.

In another direction. Nippon Electric is gradually shedding its designation
NEAC: starting in May 1981 it changed the brand name of its office computer to
NBC.

Software: QC (quality control) was introduced to improve quality and production
of software. and this company hopes to double productivity within 2 years. This
company. which started testing QC operation in the software area in November
1980. initiated QC operations in 60 businesses (about 4,000 people) in April
198! and has embraced a new awareness revolution in what is called QC operations

in the software age.
5. Toshiba

While the accounting standards may have been changed. Toshiba's rise from
ninth rank in sales during I978 and 1979 to fifth rank has become a major topic
of interest. The company had been experiencing sales difficulties. which peaked

1:2
FOR OFFICIAL use ONLY
in FY-76, and the present rise is indicative of the situation that its new
system centered on DA industries is on the right track. The company is targeting
sales of 95 billion yen in FY-Bl and 110 billion yen in FY—BZ. and it started
construction of s new plant for peripheral equipment (within the Oume plant) in
June 1981 as part of the plan to achieve these sales. It is also putting con-
siderable strength into exports and has plans for 15-20 billion yen exports
during FY-BZ.

The PY-BO sales record for various products and the targeted goals for FY-81

which the company released at the start of the year included the following
items.

Office computer: 4.400 units produced in FY-BO; cumulative total to date:
24,000 units; targeted for FY-Bl: 6.300 units.

Hinicomputer: 1.070 units (26.7 billion yen) during FY-BO; cumulative: b.920
units; targeted for FY-81: 1.300 units.

Peripheral equipment targeted for FY-Bl: magnetic disks: 8.000 units; printers:
16,000 units; floppy-disk facilities: 60.000 units.

Japanese word processors: 1,060 units sold in FY-81; cumulative total: 1.270
units; targeted for FY-Bl: 2.100 units. '

The following are the major topics being considered from FY-BO through FY-Bl.

Expansion of the 0A business system: The Office Automation Business Plan Office
established in April 1979 was expanded to the Office Automation General Depart-
ment in November 1980 and was further expanded to the "Office Automation Busi-
nessDepsrtment"as of 1 October 1981. In addition to the planning. proposing
and business supporting function of the 0A business strategy. the 0A equipment
and system sales functions which the Electric Communication Business Department
(such as facsimiles). Electronic Computer Business Department (such as office
computer) and the Instrument and Equipment Business Department (such as ordinary
paper reproduction equipment) had formerly handled were transferred and systema-
tized in this new department.

This newly established "Office Automation Business Department" encompasses 15
departments including 8 sales departments. such as office automation accounting
department. office automation plans department. office automation business
department. office automation sales promotion department. office automation
system sales department. first facsimile sales department. second facsimile

sales department. office computer sales department. business personal computer
sales department. word processors sales department. personal computer sales
department. copier sales department, office automation system technology depart-
ment. office computer technology department and office automation service depart-
ment.

0A equipment: These instruments include PPC (plain paper copier), word proc-
essors. facsimiles, office computer. personal computer and button telephones.
Among these instruments are the Japanese word processorst-10snd JH-S which
have the confidence and record of a cleanup better. These are followed in the

number 5 batting position by the business-use personal computer BP-100 announced
in October 1980 and marketed in January 1981. and the lowbcost personal computer
"Pasopia" announced on 28 September 1981 by the 0A Business Department. The
company is also reinforcing these 0A equipment sales network. A sales agreement
was reached with Kokuyo in June 1981. Kokuyo has about 6.500 sales outlets
over the entire country. of which 300 will be handling Toshiba 0A equipment

in 1981. according to present plans. According to this company. there are 27

sales outlets for office computer. 23 outlets for word processors. 27 outlets

for BP-lOO personal computer and 9 outlets for data entry equipment which repre-
sent the company in sales (special sales stores) as of June 1981. Twelve
Toshiba household electric appliance service stations (260 sites) and 13,000
sales stores (Toshiba stores). under the umbrella will be mobilized for the sales
of the new personal computer "Pasopia." and mass production and mass sales
development are expected momentarily. The company has already started utilizing
the household electrical appliances sales network for the sales of PFC (plain
paper copier) since the spring of 1980.

Export: Exports of the company's computer related products during FY-78 did

not exceed 2 billion yen. but then they sharply increased to 6.6 billion in FY—80
and 8 billion in FY-Bl. It initiated exports of business-use personal computer
and word processors to Europe in June 1981. Since the summer of 1980. it has
been exporting facsimiles to Europe in the form of OEH through the ITT (Interna-
tional Telephone and Telegraph) affiliate. Only the medium-speed models were
exported initially. but OEH export of high-speed facsimiles to the West German
SEL (Standard Electric Lorentz) Company was initiated in March 1981. Other 03H
exports include the supply of Winchester-type medium—capacity magnetic disk
devices to the American Ampex Company which started at the end of 1980.

Toshiba America initiated retail sales of the word processor B" 100 and the
personal computer T ZOO/T 250 in July 1981 through an OA equipment outlet in
Costa Mesa in the state of California. followed by another outlet at Hestwood
in October.

Dispersed processing: Product strategy regarding computers is based on "dis-
persed processing." The TOSBAC DP/6. which came out just before the IBM 8100
announcement. was followed in August 1980 by the DP/8. and then the appearance
on the market of the small-scale dispersed processing system with Chinese
character processing capability in September 1981. The company's cumulative
record of delivery for the dispersed processing system came to 1.260 systems by
the end of September 1981. Some large customers are Essa Standard Oil for 37
systems. Nada Kobe Livelihood Cooperative Association for 13 systems. Ministry
of Construction for 24 systems. Japan Highway Association for 27 systems. Tokyu
Construction for 2 systems and Alps Electric for 11 systems. The company has
placed improvement in cost performance through sales of dispersed processing as
one phase of its comprehensive 0A.

Hinicomputer: The company has expanded its 32~bit family minicomputers. The
lowest member 7/60 of the TOSBAC series 7/70 which first appeared in January

1978 was put on the market in November 1980. and the top level 7/70 E of the 7170
series appeared in June 1981. These were followed by the 1.2 HIPS TOSBAC Data
System 600 using a 32-bit high-speed computing device which was put on the market
as a science and technology use computer. Furthermore. the 16-bit family

uh
roe orncw. use ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

minicumputer includes the 2.l HIPS and the TOSBAC series 7 Model 70 E which has
the highest domestic performance (September 1981). The reinforcement of the
lineup in high-performance minicomputers has been an eyecatching trend. par-
ticularly during 1981.

6. Old. Electric

Oki Electric Industries saw its business take a turn for the worse starting
about March 1977. but President Hasao Hiyske. who came to this company from the
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation in 1978. took such reconstruc-
tion measures as suspending operations of the Shinagawa plant and retreating from
NC devices to eliminate unprofitable plants and departments and cutting back
personnel by 1.500. and restructuring the organization to reinforce sales activi-
ties. The results, together with the conservation of power boom. caused a turn-

around in the business by March 1980, and the greatest profit of all time was
realized.

Salas were further increased in ”—80. totaling 186 billion yen. This company.
which had been involved only in sales to government and municipal offices. is
reinforcing sales to a large number of unspecified users. The 0A boom which came
at an opportune moment has been a good wind which expanded this company's com-
mercial market. and the activity in the information processing equipment area is
particularly eyecatching.

The sales breakdown for this company in the various areas is shown in Table 16.
In ”-80 measurement and control equipment was added to its electronic busines
equipment. and this is reported under the category of information processing
equipment sales. Consequently. the sales reported under information processing
related heading in Table 2 breaks down into 69.5 billion yen for electronic busi-
ness equipment and 9.3 billion for measurement and control equipment. 0n the
other hand. the increase in the measurement and control equipment area was only
300 million yen. and the increase was substantially due to electronic business
equipment such as the online terminal equipment for financial institutions and
0A equipment (personal computer, word processors) and new printer for export.

The company is anticipating expansion in consumer demand for its 0A equipment
from the private sector during ”-81. and it expects to amass total sales of
88.7 billion yen. or an increase of 13 percent over the previous year. The
reason the cowany's rate of growth is so low is that it does not put out a
general use computer. and its sales in office computer were initiated later than
those of other companies.

The main activities of this company from ”-80 through FY-Bl are the following.

0A policy: In the reorganizational change of 11 December 1980. a new sole 0A
department was created. That is to say. an "OA System Business Promotion
Department" was newly created under the information processing industry depart-
ment. This change was along the lines of the SUB (strategy business unit) which
was adopted in FY-79. It consisted of the establishment of the 0A system, which
had been included under the computer business department. as an independent 0A
system as a SUB unit. At the same tine. the second electronic computer sales
department of the information processing business department was renamed the
"0A system sales department," and a system with emphasis on 0A was established.

In‘pddition. Oki Comnmnication Equipment Sales underwent a change in company
name to "0ki Electric Sales" as of 20 June 1981 in order to develop the strong
points of 0A product sales. This company in the past had conducted sales of
Oki’s 0A equipment such as facsimiles. word processors and personal computer
type 0A equipment, and this change in name was an opportunity to intensify the

effort.

Personal computer as main line of 0A: Oki Electric considers 0A in a different
light from large main-frame computer makers which think 0A centering on host
computer. More specifically, it considers the personal computer to be the
nucleus of its 0A. That is why this company takes the attitude that these are
products to be handled by the computer business department, while semiconductor
and household electric appliance business departments handle personal computers
in other companies. The personal computer which is the heart of this 0A is the

"IF 800" which was first umrketed in May 1980. Delivery was started in October
I980. and sales are being conducted through sales companies which have signed
sales contracts with five designated sales outlets (wholesale companies).

h6
ma omcm use ONLY
Software supply is being promoted together with this systematization in business
pathways. A software registry system "AP Bank" has been established for software
for the IP 800. Package software of very high general-use capability will be
distributed through these wholesale houses. At the same time, sales of CP/H
which is an OS of the Microsoft Company was initiated in the spring of 1981.

Export: Export of printers is taking place in orderly manner. It was announced
that export of teleprinters and small printers totaled 5.8 billion in FY-80 alone.
The sale of printers is undergoing a sharp increase in demand with the popularity
of personal computer and terminal equipment. and this company is planning on
business of 7 billion yen in FY-81 and 10 billion yen in PY-82. Of special note
is the small printer Oki Typer Model 5200 (dot matrix mode. 80 characters/second).
This is sold under the brand name "Hicroline 80" in the United States and Europe.
Export of a large OEH export of this printer to the large computer maker Sperry
Univac Company was initiated in 1980. The company anticipates exports will go

up to 30.000-50.000 units in 3-b years.

In addition. Oki started exporting facsimiles to the United States in PY-81.
These are OEH exports to the 3M Company of the United States. and the contract
calls for something slightly under 10,000 units over the next 2 years (OEH
version of the heat-sensitive high-speed facsimile OKIPAX 7800). The company
also has signed contracts with 4 companies. including the Huirhead Company of
Britain to supply about 40.000 units over the next three years.

New products: The intelligent terminal "OKITAC-IOO family" (six types) announced
on 18 September 1981 which incorporates the 16-bit microcomputer may become the
next hit product. It can be used as an online terminal for personal computer use
or cluster terminal use. The cost ranges as low as 950,000 to 15 million yen.
which is evoking great interest. and Oki is coming to be called the terminal
people. The knowhow of this company in the area of man-machine interface has
never been more evident.

The development of a heat—sensitive type small printer (announced in June 1981)
which can print at the high speed of 2 milliseconds per line is attracting great
interest in the area of printers.

Super LSI: The VLSI production plant "Hiyazaki Oki Electric" constructed in
Hiyazaki Prefecture initiated operation in August 1981. Production of the Gb-K
RAM was advanced from the expected October to September.

7. Japan Univac

This company. which is targeting annual sales in excess of 100 billion yen in
FY-83. had sales of 88.4 billion yen in FY-80 (2.5-percent increase over the
preceding year) and residual sales agreements of 153.2 billion yen (6.8-percent
increase over previous year). The profit-loss picture was essentially as pro—
jected at the start of the year. with sales totaling 78.65 billion yen (6.8-
percent increase over preceding year). working profit of 2.425 billion yen
(23.8-percent decrease from previous year) and profit after taxes of 1.63
billion yen (4.7-percent increase over preceding year). The reason for the
decrease in the working profit is that the company shifted its emphasis from
normal sales to rentnl sales in order to improve the company's financial struc-
ture. but in the process the company experienced an increase in cost due to high
interest rate.

Sales totaling 85 billion yen. working profit of 3.2 billion yen and profit after
taxes of 1.4 billion yen are expected for FY-81.

The major activities of this company from FY-80 through TY-8l are the following.

Organization innovation: As of 1 April 1981. the company introduced an organiza-
tional change that consists of abolishing the headquarters system and switching
to the Business Headquarter System based on the types of products lines. This

is a stepping stone to the expected realisation of loo-billiondyen sales in
FY-83. The three newly established departments are: the first Business Con-
trol Department (in charge of large systems). the Second Business Control
Department (in charge of medium and small general-use computers and complex
systems such as P08 and graphic systems and systems development) and the Customer
Business Department (in charge of customer service). There are in addition the
Comprehensive Plans Department (establishment of long-term and comprehensive
business plans) and the Technology Plan Department (long-term technology develop-
ment plan). which are newly established organs to establish the company strategy
along these lines.

The reason for the establishment of the business headquarters system is to improve
the quality in customer service by consolidating all activities. stocking. sales
and maintenance service in one business headquarters and thereby clarifying

where the responsibility lies. The reason for the establishment of the Second
Business Control Department is to expand in the future the sales volume of the
Department's products to the level of the main frame system (currently one-third).

Advance into 0A: In the midst of consistent lateness in advance into the 0A area
on the part of the foreign—funded businesses. this company sponsored an OA sym-
posium in Tokyo and Osaka during November 1980 at which time it introduced its
concepts regarding 0A. which it called 108 (intelligent office systems). Then.
in May 1981. preceded by a business show. it announced its initial product based
on the 108 concept. the Japanese-character word processor UH-lO. the personal

computer UPIOB Model 10/20 and the UPIOQ.

At the same time. it put on the market as related products the multiple-purpose
office computer UNIVAC Series 8 Model 40 Chinese character in May. Still later.
in July 1981, it opened its 0A showroom at Shibuya in Tokyo. The company also
calls this room an "office school" where it offers personal computer basic
courses and instructional courses in the operation of word processors.

while the company was making direct sales of its 0A equipment. it decided to
adopt the sales-outlet mode just as the other Japanese makers in order to
increase its sales. The first member the company tries to use is the Electronic
Computational Center which uses the Univac-made computer. These will be
organized as sales outlets for the sale of personal computer and Japanese word
processors.

Fulfillment of product series: This company is promoting other product lines in
addition to 0A. It added its small computer OUR Series 80 and Chinese-character
related products such as Chinese-character office computer during 1980. In
August 1980. it introduced its POS system and marketed its UNIPOS 6000.

Another outstanding product is its graphic display UNIVAC A08 2000 series
(August 1980).

This company put strength into the graphics area even at an early stage. and
CAD [computer aided design] and business graphics are the most advanced indus-
tries. The business graphics displayed at its May 1981 business show were an
excellent demonstration and drew much attention.

In the area of general-use computers. the multiprocessor system UNIVAC 1100/622
(July 1980) and a new model 615 of the UNIVAC 1100/60 bank-card system (October
1980) were announced.

Self-developed products: As one phase of the diversification in products, self-
developed products of Japan Univac made their debut in 1981. The first to appear
was the information control terminal system, SF—7000 Shopfloor Terminal System,
for working sites. which was announced by the composite system business section
of the Second Industrial Control Department on 11 July 1981. This product was
developed with the confidence of export to the American Univac Company.

At the same time. it announced its UNIVAC Model 65 which is a general-use com-
puter in September 1981.

Manufacturing industry market: The company announced its new production control
use system package UNIS based on the HR? method in September 1979, and it
expanded the use of the UNIS so that it can be applied to the 1100, 90, 7, 80, 8
and all the other computers handled by the company. In addition. it promoted
CAD/CAM centered on the A08 2000 and is nurturing its factory automation as one
of its pillars through self-developed equipment such as the above-mentioned
industrial site information management terminal.

Programleas software: In May 1981 the company marketed the so-called OA-use
software named the "MAPPER-llOO" which is said to be able to perform information
processing without the construction of a program. It can activate the functions
of a large computer without programming through a dialogue mode. The English
numeral Kana version release was slated for August and the Kanji version in
January 1982. A new concept called electronic filing is the base for this

system. and llnivuc is placing all its bets on this software as the basic inage
in DA.

8. Mitsubishi Electric

H1t5ubishi Electric is a company which is definitely on the way up to a higher
rank in information processing area sales. 0f the 10 companies. 3 companies
included more products in their accounting of infatuation processing area sales.
but this company maintained its 8th rank through ”-80 just as in ”-79. Based
on past methods of accounting. this company would have been in seventh rank.

The magnitude of the rate of increase in sales of this company can be seen by a
look at Figure 3. Although the sales of infer-ration processing area in total
sales was only 5.1 percent, placing this comany at the lowest rate along with

Toshiba, its computer business has continued to shine with the fanfare of the 0A
age.

The following are the major activities of this company from FY-80 through “-81.

0A policy: In June 1980 an office automation promotion committee was established
which set up specific policies for DA business promotion by which means the 0A
pol icy of this company was initiated. According to a company survey. the 0A
related market scale will grow to 600 billion yen by 1985. Assuming this company
is able to pick up a lO-percent share of this market. it will amount to 60
billion yen. so investment in this area will be profitable according to the
decision that was made.

Emphasis is placed on office computer» and facsimiles where 0A equipment is con—
cerned, but a test-produced Japanese word processor was displayed at the Informa-
tion Processing Association's exhibition in October 1980 which appeared on the
market in April 1981 as the Mitsubishi Japanese word processor H8510. The con-
pnny also established its personal computer project section in January 1981 and
announced its entry into the personal computer market. Its entry was displayed
at tne business show in May. and the project section was changed to a personal
computer department during the same month. According to this company. its
formal entry into the personal computer sales area will take place in the spring
of 1982 in the form of a business-use personal computer with 8086 family 16-bit
CPU and main memory of l28/256 KB class.

The company set up three direct sales shops during l-‘Y-Bl and has acquired spe-
cial contract sales stores for office computer. household electrical appliances.
office equipment and stationery. It also started purchase of application programs
from American software houses in the spring of 1981.

Thu company has set up an "OA Plaza" which is a showroom for all Oh equipment in
Harunouchi. ‘l‘okyo, whlch was opened to the general public on 8 June.

0” ice computer: In FY-80, office computer deliveries from Mitsubishi Electric
passed the lc.000-unit mark, to total 4.300 units. Then, by the early part of
FY-8l, it achieved the remarkable record of cumulative deliveries of 20,000
units. The Kanji processing office computer which was put on the market in
March 1980 has been accumulating good orders for a total of more than 20,000
units. greatly exceeding expectations. The feature here is the wide expansion
In MELCOH office computer selections in both FY-80 and ”-81.

The company not only enhanced its image by exhibiting an "office computer which
can understand humn speech" even though it was a test product (business show of
May 1980) and by demonstrating new technological strength in the form of

"picture processing office computer" in May 1981. but it also strengthened its
lineup by adding such practical models as the MELCOM 80 OCR (September 1980)
which is an office computer with the OCR function. and the MELCOM 80 Model 4
Japanese-language unit (December 1980), MELCOM 80 Model 68 Japanese-language unit
(February 1981).

For FY-81. the goal has been set to obtain 5.600 orders. partially because it
rhymes with Shows 56.

IBM compatible equipment plan: October 1983 is the target date for starting
delivery. Development of the IBM compatible general-use computer is close to
completion. According to the releases. it is a dispersed processing oriented
general-use computer and the architecture adopted is such that it can be used as
a host computer or as a terminal controller. About 1.5 billion yen was invested
for the construction of the new plant within the computer production plant site
in Kamskurs in Kannguwa Prefecture (completed in May 1981). and this is the new
series development plant. Present plans include test production of the successor
to the present COSMO 800. to b(- completed sometime in 1981.

COSMO series: The COSMO series computers have been completely switched to be
bridge machines to develop IBM compatibles. These include the new 900 and its
MP version (March 1981) in the case of COSMO 900 11. sales of COSMO 800 III and
800 s, and reinforced performance of GOSH) 700 III and 700 5 (March 1981). The
entire 700. 800 and 900 series were provided with MP version. while dispersed
microcode-type functional engines (high-speed mechanism for separate functions)
were placed in the 700 and 800 series to be compatible with IBM machines as well
as to be a weapon against the other competition.

Software policy: This company is taking a stab at various areas in preparation
for the day when software will play the major role. The "MELOOM Industrial
Software" established on 1 July 1980 is the software development specialty
company for process control for industrial-use computer systems. Demand for
industrial -use computer systems increased 80 percent in FY-79 and another 30-lo0
percent in FY-80. so that dependence solely on external sources for software
would make difficult quality control and improved productivity, and this prompted
the establishment of the new company. Mitsubishi Electric put up 60 percent of
the capital and Mitsubishi Engineering put up the remaining 40 percent.

In addition. the "MELCO Control Software." a design. production and sales spe-
cialty company in the area of microcomputer control system software. was formed
on 1 October 1980. The software department of the company's control equipment
manufacturing factory was separated from the company and became independent
"HELCO Control Software."

Office computer export: The MELCOM Business System Company was set up as the
sales company to conduct office computer export directed to the United States in
December 1977, and this company has succeeded in exporting products under its
own brand name to the United States. The new company. "American Mitsubishi
Electronics" (located in Compton. California). formed from a merger with MELCO

Sales Company (in charge of sales of semiconductors. VAX. color-CRT). went into
business in July 1980 at its present site to service the Heat Coast. and is sell-
ing about 100 units of office computers per year (HELCOH 80 Models 18, 28 and 38

with about 6 dealer companies). It plans to establish a sales office on the East
Coast and expand sales in FY-Bl.

At the same time, there is need for a special-use office computer as a sales
product for the American market, and development of a special-use office computer
using the Intel 8086 family 16-bit CPU is being pushed with a target date of

April 1982. Rich this introduction. American Mitsubishi Electronics plans to
increase its sales to 300 units in FY-82.

9. Burroughs

The Burroughs Company of Japan (hereafter abbreviated to Burroughs) does not dis-
close its sales breakdown as usual, giving a reason that it settles accounts in
combination with the parent company. This may be said to be one reason why the
Japanization of this company has been delayed. Looking at the income tax return,
which gives the only publicly available figures, the values are 8.5 billion yen
for 1977. 10.6 billion yen for 1978 and 9 billion yen for 1979. followed by a
sharp drop to 3 billion yen in 1980. According to a survey conducted by this
journal. there was also a decline in sales of about 7.5 percent from the 54.6
billion yen in 1979 to 50.h7 billion yen in 1980, while net profit decreased 68
percent to 2.3 billion yen.

The reason here is the delay in this company's response to the Japanese market,
as a result of which the company found it necessary to invest large sums in

1980 to overcome the inadequacies. This involved the establishment of 20 support
centers throughout the country to set up a support system. along with 12 demon-
stration centers for the 31900 small computer use 08/00, the replacement of conr
puters of data centers to new types and the new establishment of the Yokohama
Engineering Center at a cost of 1.2 billion yen.

The Burroughs Company was a purely Japanese business back in the Takachiho Trad-
ing stage, and then it made an abrupt 180-degree turnaround to an American busi-
ness with loo-percent capital outlaycnathe part of its parent company. It is
under this American business management that it is trying to hammer out sales
policy suitable for the Japanese market. The degree to which this conversion
can be effected will be the key to its revitalization.

The following are the major topics from FY-BO through FY-81.

“lumenthal system: Blumenthal. who in August 1979 did not agree with President
Carter and resigned his post as secretary of the treasury to enter the services
of the Burroughs Company, becase chairman of the company on 1 January 1981.

Since he became the true number one in this company when he assumed the post of
leading director in September 1980. he immediately introduced an organizational

revolution. The spillover even extended to the Burroughs Company in Japan in
I980 and 1981.

Japanese market policy: The item which underwent a complete change with the
Blumenthal system was the policy with regard to the Japanese market. After

Blumenthal had been in Japan only 10 days during a visit in November 1980. he
signed the papers for the construction of a plant which had been stalled for
several years. "is comment was: "I would like to see us initiate production
of computers in .apan early in the eighties." The plan involved, first of all.
production of Kanji terminals and small computers aimed at the Japanese market:
second, a buildup in plant capacity to let this plant serve as an export base
for shipments to Asia. the United States. South America and Europe; and third.
expansion of products to large comput-rs. various types of 0A equipment and
data communication equipment. and even a jump into LSI production. This plan
went forward as planned at the start of 1981. and it has been decided to estab-
lish a manufacturing engineering center in Japan to produce a Kanji processing
system designed for the Japanese market and terminals for financial organisation
use. An engineering center for technological development (about 100 people)
was established in Yokohama. and the plan is to construct a plant in Kanagawa
Prefecture. This will be a final assembly plant. and it is expected to start
soon on local production.

One other topic is the confirmation of the American Burroughs Company's policy
to set up its first basic research laboratory outside of the United States in
Japan. This will be an Ic laboratory. and once it is completed. a comprehensive
system will have been established in Japan from 10 development to computer
production and sales.

In addition, the Burroughs Company of Japan acquired a site for production of
business forms related to computers in Tochigi Prefecture as its second volley
into the Japanese picture.

New model: The B6900 large computer (July 1980), 85900 (October 1980), B900
(October 1980) and the CP9500 family uf dispersed processing computers (November
1980) are the principal new additions. No announcements of new type equipment
were made during 1981. In another direction. President Blumenthal stopped
development of the BSP supercomputer. Along with this announcement. Japan
Electronic Calculations. which had ordered a B8? to be the number-one user in
Japan. switched over to the Hitachi large computer.

0A policy: In order to strengthen its office equipment area. the American
Burroughs Company purchased the Reductron Company which makes word processors.
the Graphics Science Company which makes facsimiles and the Context Company
which makes OCR scanners, followed by the purchase of the SDC Company which is
a large software company. and it has purchased the magnetic memory equipment
maker Hemorex during 1981. However, the present situation of the Burroughs
Company in Japan is that it has not begun to realize any benefit from these
acquisitions.

The company is fettered by previous agreements with Japanese industries and is
unable to operate freely. The consequences of this situation are major problems
which this company has to cope with.

10. Japan NCR

Japan NCR is fighting hard. Its total sales for FY-80 decreased 7.2 percent from
the preceding year to 72.2 billion yen. The operating profit and net profit

In which computer companies have been expanding sales on the crest of an OA

boom, this company together with the Burroughs Company are the only 2 members

of the top 10 companies which have been experiencing a standstill. As mentioned
earlier in this report, this company altered its sales departmental classifica-
tion and switched printers and magnetic tapes. which previously had been classi-
fied under terminal equipment. to the electronic computer category; still, the
sales for the electronic computer depart-ent suffered a decrease of 7.7 percent
(Table 20). According to the company. Japan NCR had the highest sales of all

the subsidiaries of the "CR Company of the United States. but it cannot be

denied that there is the handicap of this company's delay in adapting itself to
the Japanese market.

NCR 2140 whose sale to specialty stores was initiated in May 1980. is seeing

an increase in orders. 0n the other hand. its independent terminal and other
information processing equipment sales have decreased greatly because of the
price competition and the disposal of its pressure sensitive paper-making capsule
production department.

on equipment: At the outset of 1981, President Hitomi announced that Japan

NCR was in the process of advancing the architectural structure of its 0A and
that a start would be made toward word processors during the course of the year.
but nothing specific has materialized as of the end of September.

Assistance by US NCR: In May 1981. 14 of the directors of “CR of the United
States assembled in Tokyo and held the first board of directors meeting in Japan.
These people saw Japan's rapidly developing computer industry and market. Japan
NCR told them that Japan's computer technology is advanced. the speed of develop-
ment of new technology is fast and the competition for orders is fierce. and
thereby asked for US NCR's assistance in swiftly establishing a system that could
successfully cope with this situation and could develop products suitable for

the Japanese market.

Software: Although Japan NCR was conspicuous for its lack of new product announce-
ments, it showed an attitude of emphasizing the importance of software. In May
1980. it set up its Central Software Service Department to expand its software
maintenance service. The software NCR TRAN-QUEST system for data base use intro-
duced in August 1980. the online package system NCR STAR directed toward medium
and small banks and trust companies introduced in February 1981 and the NCR ASK
cnd user-oriented conversational information search system introduced in August
1981, are software of note despite their inconspicuous nature. According to
Japan NCR, the American NCR received $00 orders for IHCS-II packages for medium-
size manufacturing companies (as of February 1981). NCR is a company whose
activities in the software area are noteworthy.

Favorably performing ATM product of NOR: Another good news for Japan NCR is

the favorable performance of the ATM (automated teller machine) for bank use,
which accounted for 998 units or 42 percent of the 2.400 units sold in Japan
during the course of 1980. The company is aiming at sales of 1,000 units during
FY-81.

Part II. Office Automation Industry
Diagnosis of Real Strength of “Top 10" 0A Makers of Business Machines
0A Equipment Makers with Tremendous Growth

with the arrival of the 0A age. business equipment makers. computer makers.
communication equipment makers. household electrical makers and companies

which handle such products all are fighting to be carried along by the tide
regardless of whether they are makers or traders. But the strange thing is
that when the time comes to come forth with cold figures, there is no clear-cut
announcement: "These are the sales of this company's 0A equipment." In other
words. all these companies while professing themselves to be an OA maker have
not come to establish CA as an integral department.

Two reasons come to mind with regard to this situation. The first is: "What
is Oh?" The definition of on has not been clearly demarcated so that there are
some fine differences between companies in what they consider 0A to be. The
other reason is that every company started to deal with a large number of prod-
ucts once the word 0A became fashionable, and the products though loudly talked

58
FOR OFFICIAL use ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

about have not yet clearly demonstrated good sales performance. Thus. they do not
wish to announce this fact out of their defense reaction.

It is difficult to define just what 0A covers and what kind of products come under
this category by a simple statement. First of all. when one mentions office. it
can involve a variety of businesses with different contents. such as financial
industry. stores. laboratories. factories. administrative offices and sales
departments which also can vary widely in scope. Therefore. depending on the

type of office there is a different method of 0A application to it. In addition,
there are wide differences in the reasons any business acquires 0A equipment:

to rationalize office work. effect cost reductions or to mechanize.

Depending on the reason. the scope for 0A would be widely different. The first
mentioned reason can be amplified by saying that 0A encompasses everything used
to facilitate office work and includes already present computers. copiers,
electric desk calculators. steel desks. chairs. bookcases, files and writing
equipment as well as the layout of this equipment.

0n the other hand. the latter. while also having the objective of rationalizing
office work. limits the use of 0A to new type office equipment with intelligent
functions provided through cemputerization and includes advanced equipment pro-
duced by the most recent technology such as office computers, personal computers.
(Japanese) word processors. facsimiles and reproduction equipment.

Here. we will adopt the second definition. following our practice in last year's
survey. in order to define the scope of 0A makers easily and we will consider

as 0A equipment office-use computers and related equipment. word processors,
facsimiles. reproduction equipment and related equipment and the associated
expendable items.

The 10 business equipment makers discussed here do not include any company with
a strong computer maker image. They are all superior businesses which either
are already listed on the stock exchange or are well qualified to be listed.
According to the "Industry Ranking Special Edition" put out in NIPPON KEIZAI
SHIHBUN on 4 September. these 10 companies are all top-class companies and they
are: 1) Matsushita Electric Industrial (10th rank). 2) Canon (17th rank).

3) Matsushita Communication Industrial (28th rank). 4) Casio Calculator (34th
rank). 5) Ricoh (40th rank). 6) Sharp (46th rank). 7) Minolta Camera (107th
rank). 8) Koniahiroku Photographic Industry (140th rank). 9) Tokyo Electric
(218th rank) and 10) Uchida Yoko (704th rank).

When ranked according to profitability. the order is 1) Matsushita Communication
Industrial (46th rank). 2) Hatsushita Electric Industrial (76th rank). 3) Ricoh

(lslst rank). 6) Casio Calculator (195th rank). 5) Tokyo Electric (271st rank).

6) Canon (271st rank). 7) Minolta Camera (313th rank). 8) Sharp (353d rank)

and 9) Konishiroku Photographic Industry (394th rank).

The ranking according to growth is 1) Canon (36th rank). 2) Casio Calculator
(47th rank). 3) Uchida Yoko (195th rank). 4) Matsushita Communication Indus-
trial (235th rank). 5) Minolta Camera 362d rank) and 6) Sharp (399th rank). It
is readily evident that the OA-related business equipment makers are all high-
profit and large-growth-rate superior industries.

when the growth rates of these cospanies over the last 5 years were coapared, the
results shown in Figure 12 were obtained. This graph was constructed with the
sales of each coapany during FY-76 being arbitrarily set at 100 and indexing

the trends which followed. Casio Calculator with growth of 2.9 tines heads

this list. but all the coapanies are seen to have enjoyed great growth. Unfor-
tunately. it was not possible to plot a coaparison table for only the 0A

related area of these companies because they were nixed with the sales of

related products by these companies. As a result. rather than conpare these
companies, each company's sales situation is individually discussed here.

Because of the tremendous growth in OA equipment. we hope that every company
will release data which will make possible comparisons of 0A sales among com-
panies for the next survey.

Ricoh: Rationalization of "Four Functions" Through 0A

This company prides itself on being the first company in Japan to espouse 0A.
It is the standardbearer for GA on the part of the business equipment makers.

Ricoh breaks down business contents into four major categories. by which it
seeks to maintain rational interplay between the categories. improve business
efficiency and effect cost reduction. The means to this end is the array of
various business machines. The advent of the microcomputer and the large
decrease in cost of memory and 10. the advances in making machines more intelli-
gent. the combinations of the different instruments and systematization have
taken place. This company says that now is the time to start office automation.

The "four functions" which Ricoh espouses as basics of 0A are: 1) document
composition; 2) reproduction. printing; 3) information transmission; and k)
storage. search. It proposes to introduce 0A to enable the smooth flow of these
functions and to further improve efficiency. Ricoh has a full stock of the
various items of equipment necessary to this end.

First of all. the representative equipment for document composition is the
Japanese word processor. Ricoh sells a unique word processor. "RIPORT 600."
which has facsimile capacity at its output section. This unit can activate a
facsimile located in a distant office to print out a copy directly in the other
office. The printout is through a 32 x 32 dot matrix per character which pro-
duces highly dense and very readable characters. Once one becomes accustomed.
he can use a two-stroke method which has higher input speed than any other
method. These are some of its feasures. Ricoh is going to share the specifica-
tions of this input method with Hitachi and popularize and sell the instrument
well.

Another representative item of document composition equipment is the office com-
puter ”Ricom series" which is of a component type and has a memory unit. display.
keyboard and printer which are independent from each other. The design is such
that each unit can be efficiently used depending on the type of work. The
"RICOH 2600 series" will be added to the line in October. enhancing this prod-
uct line even more. The H15 plan which envisions 15 percent of the market

share is proceeding; at present it has 10 percent of the market.

The reproduction and printing related equipment is the dollar box which accounts
for 85 percent of kicoh's sales. The popular "DT series” is the mainliner here.
but a high-speed PPC "PT 7500" with a speed of 60 sheets per minute has been
placed on the market to meet the needs of large businesses for a large number

of copies.

Ricoh announced its intelligent reproduction unit "GT-1000" as the model 0A
reproduction equipment last spring. This is a reproduction unit into which an
original can be put. and then subjected to editing, additions. deletions. etc.,
before copies are made. Ricoh was the first to come out with an actual

reproduction unit which altered the role of a copier which simply "reproduced
the same thing."

kicoh is aiming for a bS-percent share in PPC. and it has but a little way to go
before it will attain this goal.

In the field of facsimile, which is a representative example of the information
treatment area. the company developed the world's first high-speed facsimile
for business use. and has been concentrating its business on high-speed units.
It is said that this company has 90 percent of the Western market share and

50 percent of the domestic market share. Increasing its share in the medium-
speed market is its present goal. and it hopes to achieve a better balance by

such a shift. The main equipment is the "RIPAX 6300 series" for trunkline
network use and the world's smallest 63-62 "supermini" "RIPAX 3300 series."

Ricoh's storage and search equipment includes microfilming equipment carried
over from the past and a "Linsc information search system" which retrieves
documents required in computer searches from files. This system readily
searches for and retrieves the desired document and makes possible a great
speedup in business treatment.

Ricoh is trying to combine these various products to obtain even better and more
convenient-to-use 0A systems. The intracompsny system has been altered to
separate the plans section from the sales headquarters. made it into the plans
headquarters and thereby reinforce the system so that it could quickly respond
to the needs and develop new products.

Fuji Xerox: with 018 Which Incorporates Respect for Man

Fuji Xerox uses the tern OIS (office information system) in the same manner as
0A. It is said that this name is preferred because the term office automation
creates an image of conservation of manpower and mechanization. This company
wanted to introduce a term which describes an environment in which man can work
in a more meaningful manner, and thus the term 018 was proposed.

This line of thinking is clearly represented in the company's work station com-
munications network "Isaact." This is a process developed by Xerox Company of
the United States, for which Fuji Xerox disclosed the patent in Japan in January.
The various work stations within an office are connected to a coaxial cable
(lsanet cable) for mutual communication. At the same time, work stations can

be freely added, removed or altered without ever having any effect on the rest
of the network, making for easy utilization which is the major feature of this
system.

The Isanet can be freely altered in line with personnel changes and organizational
changes and is an 018 with respect for man.

The handling of intraplant information transmission and collection at a work
station may seem a long way off, but Xerox is treating it as an item of the
present.

The single 0A piece of equipment which Fuji Xerox is marketing is centered on
PPC. The sales of PFC-related products account for 90 percent of the company's
total sales. Fuji Xerox was established in 1962 as a PPC maker and went along
for about 8 years with no competitor in this area, so that it was able to

63

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

proceed smoothly in product development and sales. As the domestically pro-
duced PPC centered on the popular model began to dominate the market, the prod-
uct development based on the premise of rental of Fuji Xerox became inappro-
priate to the popular type PPC market. and a shift was made from minor changes
to the American-made Xerox PPC to the development of a domestic original
product.

As a result. there are a number of energy-saving PPC types beginning with the
development of a bO-sheete/minute high-speed PPC "Xerox 3500" capable of oper-
ating on household loo-volt. lS-amp current, followed by the 32-sheete/minute
"Xerox 3402," the "Xerox 6800." and the Xerox 2350" with two-stage reduction
capability. These PPC not only have good performance but are also advantageous
in the matter of the two items of cost and ability to be used with ordinary power
sources, which make them appealing products to high-speed PPC users. This com-
pany has now begun to export units to Xerox companies in Europe and the United
States. The Fuji Xerox popular PPC "Xerox 2300" is now being asaenbled in the
United States as well as being supplied throughout the world.

The "Xerox 9200." which is a high-speed PPC for centralized copy treatment use.
has been performing well with essentially no other competitor in sight. At the
ease time, it handles such large volunes that there is very great effect on
profits. so that it has becone the dollar coffer for the American Xerox Company.
This sane unit is also perforning well in Japan and is a valuable product.

The nedium-apeed "Telecopier 685" and the high-speed "Telecopiar 690" are the

main items in the area of facsiniles, and the "Telscopier 1.85" is being exported
to Europe.

In addition. Fuji Xerox is establishing sales comanies throughout the country

with joint subscriptions fron influential local enterprises; already 25 such
conpanies have started sales.

Canon: Aims at developing CA as an independent business area through developing
abundant 0A products

Canon puts out a varied array of OA-related products. Some of the najor products
include reproduction equipnent, office computers. desktop computers, laser beam
printers, Japanese word processors and business facsimiles. The total sales of
these equipnent are listed in the table below as 0A equip-ent sales by this com-
pany.

If we consider CA from an even broader viewpoint. desk calculators, microfilm
equipment and electronic Kanji dictionary have to be included. Canon is a

leading maker of desk calculators. and including this item under the sales total
of 0A equipment makes this sum slightly in excess of 100 billion yen by adding

the calculator sales total of 23.3 billion yen for FY—79 and 27.2 billion attained
in Flt—80. Canon's business is split nearly equally between photographic equipment
and business equipment (0A related), and it is proceeding with balanced growth
between these two areas.

The list of Canon's OA-related equipment is large. but its main strength is in
reproduction equipment. which account for 56 percent of the total sales in
business equipment related areas. This is an important toehold in the 0A
department. The advent of Canon PPC sales in 1970 was this country's first
competitor to the Xerox machine where reproduction technology was concerned.

By producing and developing PPC, this company has developed enormous influential
strength in the business machines market.

The company points to computers and laster beam printers as important future
products whicn will become valuable system equipment. and it is putting great
effort in these products and the establishment of their sales network. The two
daught :r companies, Canon Sales and Canon Electronics. were formed simultane-
ously on 2‘1 August to make their appearance in the Second Stock kchange. This
was the first occasior. in which sibling companies made applications to the Stock
Exchange simultaneou1..y and were accepted the same day. Although this is an
episode reflecting the strength of these two companies. it is also a reflection
of Canon's strength. Canon Sales is expected to double over the next 5 years.
and it is pointing toward expanding the sales department which deals with office
computers. facsimiles. word processors and laser beam printers and making the
department an independent company.

Canon is also putting great effort into its production strongholds for these
items of on equipment: it has made its Toride plant in Ibarski Prefecture the
main plant for reproduction equipment production by expanding the plant. It

66
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

also established its Ani plant. which asinly produces desk calculators and sinilar
equip-ant. at Ali. also in lbarski Prefecture. It also has its Dene plant for
production of PPC use toners and drua at Dena in Hie Prefecture. and all of

these plants have been coupleted between the spring and fall of this year.

Expansion is taking place in Canon's overseas plants as well: plant expansions
are mderway at the Giessen plant in Heat Gemny and Canon Msiness hchinss'
in the thited States. In addition. Copia (its sales depart-ant becans indepen-
dent Copia Sales). which case under the mbrella of Canon 2 years ago. has
established a cooperative systsa in both production and sales and has proven to
be a powerful strategic strength.

Sane princpal 0A products of Canon are the high-speed "NP-600 RB with a speed
of an sheets/minute. the super-highspeed "NP-8500." with a speed of 77 sheets]
minute. as the PPC "NP series" representative products, the Japanese word
processor "CANONHORD 55." the office cmuter "CANONAC 71K.” the high-speed
facsinile which can trans-it enlarged or reduced copies "CANON Teleflex M01."
and the laser bean printer "LIP-108K."

Sharp: All-out in new Business Direction

Sharp is adopting the 0A concept as "new business." This is a nanifestation of
the need to come out with a rapid. creative.high-productivity systen to develop
the capacity to win out in this industrial battle. In order to realise this
goal. it has set up the two standards of "PRESTO Office” on the hardware front
and the ”CREATE “men" on the software front.

"PRESTO" consists of six elements designed to speed office operations. and it was
coined fro. the initial letters of these elenents: paper. record. energy. space.
tins and organization. This words neans "rapid" in Italian.

At the same tine. "CREATE" represents the six elenents designed to turn nan to
creative efforts and is conprised of the first letters of comfortable. reliable.
easily. active. taste and expert. '

Sharp's 0A equipnent incorporates nanry nan-oriented features. In addition. in
contrast to 0A Sharp has classified desk calculators. personal cowuters and
electronic translators. which are deeply tied in with individual use. as PA
(personal autonation) equip-eat and given then a special niche.

Sone its-s of Sharp's 0A equip-eat are the office counter ”HAYAC series." the
Japanese word processor "Shoin." the reproduction equipment "81’ series," and
the facsinile "P0 series."

The weight of 0A equipnent with respect to total sales is 12-13 percnet. which
is snall. but this is the result of great sales strengths in other areas such
as household electrical units. The total sales of 0A equipnent exceeds 60
billion yen. The total sales of the industrial equipnent sales headquarters
which deals with GA equipment and PA equiplsent was 132.5 billion yen. There
is already an active export of PPC. and export of office coaputers to the West
has been growing this year.

Minolta Camera: Rapid PPC Growth with MT Mode

Minolta Camera had sales of 52.5 billion yen in office equipment and special
equipment. the greater part of which came fron reproduction equipment. and what
may be termed 0A equipment such as computer-related items were limited to micro-
film equipment besides PPC. This is an unusual case in the midst of, this 0A age
when most of the makers are coming out with an increasing variety of 0A products.

With the smooth growth in its PPC. this company is undergoing a rapid increase
in exports. headed by the OEM supply to IBM in the United States. There was a
77-percent increase over the previous year in exports of business equipment and
specialty equipment during “-80.

The event which enabled Minolta Camera. which had been far behind in its PPC
development. to enjoy such good growth was the development of s microparticle
carrier reproduction method based on an MT (microtoning) mode and its use in the
popular PPC "HP-310." The clear copies made by this product were well accepted.
and there was a sharp increase in exports from the outset.

Furthermore. the "HP-310" drew IBM's attention. and as soon as Minolta Camera
began the on! export of this product to ma. the evaluation of the MT mode rose
one notch higher.

In good timing with this situation. Minolta Camera constructed a new PPC produc-
tion plant and designated this new Mizuho plant the main plant for mass produc-
tion of its "E? series." while it changed the existing Mikawa plant (renamed from
the Toyokawa BM plant) into a production plant for snail-volume lot products.

In addition. it sensed the need to increase production of consumable itens. and
it is expanding its Itami plant to this end.

The Mizuho plant. where a mass production was possible starting this July.
produces 11,000 units of 2 main models. 8? 310 and BP 320. per month. and 17.000
units if including ’0 other models. 8? 520. new 3? $30 and 8? S303. and console-

type B? 710.

The company has also developed another 0A product in the form of the general-
use multifunctional printer "Minolta EC 30." [Intelligent Copier] which was
announced last fall. This instrument is based on the static electricity latent
image reproduction mode duplicator ”EC 301" and exploits its image reproduction
mode. It incorporates a high-performance multistylus head (needle electrodes)
which is equipped with general printing capabilities. It can superimpose soft
copies written in by electric signals on originals. and can be utilized as print
mechanisms for a number of systems.

Aims at lS-Percent Share by Ubics

Konishiroku Photographic Industry has compiled a tradition as a usher in the
inugc technology area which has specialized in photographic filn and printing

paper. and it is therefore taking a determined look at the quality of copy
reproduction in the area of reproduction technology. Its “Ubics" (with superior
copy quality) was born from such a background.

Konishiroku's basic position is also the same with regard to on products. It is
engaged in development of the output areas such as a no-impact printer and an
intelligent copier. Next. it proposes to develop 0A systems to exploit these
items of equipment by combining them with computer and communication technology.
As a result. the present 0A product situation of this company is such that the
Ubics PPC accounts for the greater part of the business.

The "Ubics" has survived a full 10 years in the market since its first introduc—

tion in 1971. It is being exported to Europe and the United States in great
numbers. It now has roughly 10-12 percent of the world's PPC market.

Konishiroku is planning to increase its share of the world market to 15 percent
within the next 5 years. As one phase of this po1icy. the sales base Konishiroku
Ubice signed a sales agreement with Plus for sales in the domestic market. It is
considered necessary to expand its sales routes and number of sales outlets in
order to attain a 15-percent share of the market. and this company plans to sell
its "Ubics" at the roughly 3.000 stationary stores which Plus maintains through-
out the country and hopes to achieve a 6.000-unit increase in sales per year.

On the product front. the "Ubics V" is proving to be a great hit in the United
States; and it is a PPC of stable quality. The "Ubics V2." which is even further
improved. has appeared on the domestic market. and the "Ubics 3000" and "Ubics
3000 P" with semidocument feeder attachment which appeared in July are becoming
this company's main sales items.

The developer has been improved starting with this "Ubics 3000 series." and copy
quality has been greatly improved by measures to increase the static electric
retention property of the carrier.

Hatsushita Electric Group: Reinforces Unity with "GA Conference“

Matsushita Electric Industrial is trying to cope with the 0A are with its total
energy together with its daughter compsnies. Hatsushita Communication Industry
and Hatsushita Electrical Transmission Equipment.

A concrete display of this effort is the "0A conference“ started this spring

in which five members—-Presidsnt Yamashita of Hatsushita Electric Industrial,
Director Nakai (head of the special equipment sales headquarters). Director
Hayakawa (director of technology headquarters and director of central laboratory).
President Ogama of Hatsushita Communication Industry, and President Kins of
Hatsushita Electrical Transmission Equipment-meet at stated monthly intervals

to establish overall policy an OA industry problems.

The suborganizations of this Ca conference include a technology development com-
mittee, comprehensive design committee. public relations committee and 0A promo-
tion committee which are assigned to conduct the necessary functions to promote
0A industry for the entire Hatsushita group. Hataushita Electric Industrial and
the group companies each has its own development organs and plans staff. and

these have been planning industrial expansion as part of their individual
responsibilities. however, this would make for poor investment efficiency, and
the group efforts could not be properly coordinated. So they are trying to halmer
out an OA area policy under the leadership of Hatsushita Electric Industrial. and
to develop 0A as a new pillar enterprise.

The basic line of thinking with regard to GA on the part of the Hatsushita
Electric Industrial group is that "true 0A is 0A which brings forth creativity
in the office with respect for man,“ and it seeks to attain all-out mechanization

of those daily office routines which can he mechanized, and to improve the over-
all efficiency of the business and management areas by a smooth operation of
information treatment. storage and retrieval and communication. It further

seeks the use of the extra time provided by the mechanization efforts for creative
activities which make more effective use of a Ian's time as well as seeking to
provide a more pleasant working environment. In this manner. it seeks to makew
the functioning of the working man more human and to create an ideal office
environment where full activity takes place. This is the concept in a nutshell.

The following is the 0A equip-eat which the Hatsuehita Electric Industrial group
handles according to maker: Hutsushita Electric Industrial: PPC, office com-
puter. REC; Hatsushita Comnication Industry: office computer. word processors;
Hatsushita Electrical Transmission Equipment: facsimiles. word processors;
Matsushita Industrial Equipment: gasoline P08; Kyushu Hatsushita Electric
Industrial: color slide production equipment. shredder; and Psnafacom: personal
computer.

All these items of 0A equipment are marketed in Japan through the Hatsushita
Electric Industrial special equipment industry headquarters. Total sales were
about as billion yen in FY-SO and accounted for one-twelfth of the total sales of
this special equipment industry headquarters. The main items in this category
were the facsimile of Hatsushita Electrical Transmission Equipment and the office
computer of Hatsushita Communication Industry. A sales total of 70 billion yen
is targeted for this year; efforts will be directed at improving the sales
records of the PPC and office computer produced by Hatsushita Electric Industrial.

The following charts show all the facsimile related sales included under the
0A sales total, but the sales of Hatsushita Communication Industry are not dif-
ferentiated from the electronic equipment area. and this total includes elec-
tronic measurement equipment. control equipment. desk calculators and a number
of other products.

At the same time. the Hatsushita Electric Industrial group has established 0A
centers in Osaka and Tokyo as one phase of its 0A industry promotion. and these
showrooms are jointly occupied by related businesses (mainly sales companies).
This setup has brought favorable results to both publicity and sales records of
Hatsushita group. and plans are being readied to open many more 0A centers in
other major cities.

Tokyo Electric: Exploit Strength of Close Relationship with Financial Industry

Tokyo Electric is one of the satellite companies of Toshiba and has been active
in a business with strength directed at financial equipment such as P08 and
registers. That is why the weight of the sales of this company differs greatly
in the display of its scale in the 0A industry depending on whether or not sales
in the register area are considered as part of 0A.

According to its financial report for PY-80. the main line of equipment accounted
for more than 60 percent of the sales. A more detailed breakdown showed regis-
ters accounting for 27 percent. measurement equipment for 5 percent. office com-
puter type information equipment related area for 3 percent and the rest for 25
percent. to make up this 60 percent.

As a result. when taken on a rough estimate, about 60 percent of the gross or
50.7 billion yen in sales was accounted for by GA sales. and this was 3 percent
or 2.5 billion yen where office computer was concerned. How. in addition Tokyo
Electric has other equipment such as printers for computers and online window

75
roe OFFICIAL us: ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

terminal equipment for post office use which it lists under "other equipment."
and if these are also included, the estimate becomes 17 billion yen or an
increase of roughly 70 percent over the preceding year's sales.

The sales of printers for computer use of Tokyo Electric have increased sharply.
as described above. This is an area where major effort has been directed since
PY-79. Riding on the wave of rapid growth created by office computer and per.
sonal computers. sales were increased from 2.6 billion yen in FY-79 to alnost
three times as much. or 7 billion yen. in FY-BO. and the company expects to
double this total to 14 billion yen this fiscal year. The company constructed
a plant solely for printer production at its Oohito Oni plant in Shizuoka Pre-
fecture and also expanded its lines at Hishims to establish a greatly expanded
production system. Thus, the company is making its effort to promote this new
popular product.

Along computer related lines, Tokyo Electric is showing good sales performance
for its independently developed office computer and personal computers besides
the Toshiba line. This computer exploits the expert knowledge of the financial
world by this company. and its personal computer "Haitec T 555-20 series" can
be altered to a POS depending on the terminal system.

Tokyo Electric entered into a sales agreement with Kokuyo this spring on the
"Haitec T 550-20 series." and this event clearly displayed the reinforced agree-
ment relationship between Toshiba and Kokuyo in the 0A area.

Uchida Yoko: 0A Door Opened by DOA

Uchida Yoko considers 0A to be an overall office problen. and it has proposed
"DOA" (design and office automation) as a concept which envelope 0A. This term
incorporates the feeling of an "on door."

DOA takes in three concepts—l) design auto-etion. 2) office auto-tine. and

3) office design—in an all-inclusive nnner to cover all the ale-ants necessary
to 0A directed toward research and develop-ant staff. 0A for general pure office
work and creation of pleasant office environment. For Uchida Yoko. which covers
the entire 0a area including business equip-eat. steel furniture. educational
equipaent and cowuters. this appears to be a goal that can be attained.

Its desiy: automtion is what is generally ternsd CAD "co-puter aided design.”
It is a systea that enables a designer to nernipulate two- or three-diseasional
graphics siwly. accurately and rapidly based on a saall anount of data. The
instrument used here is the high tecl'mology calculation personal-use coeputer
which is towined with a digitalizer as input cosponent and an X! plotter as

output cowonent .

The office automtion units which cowrise Uchida Yoko's DOA point toward a
future work station which is s cowuter terminal with all types of capabilities
encomassed within its network. At present. it has the single capabilities of
a word processor and facsiaile; it will gradually increase its capabilities as
e coeputer is installed.

Office design is the creation of a pleasant working environ-ant for people. who
ate up the single lost i-portant entity of an office. Dchida Yoko considers'
that office design is en inortant constituent of 0A because the preparation of
an environment in which 0A equip-ant can be fully exploited and sea can fully
express his inherent creativity is an essential eleunt in the developwent of

0A.

According to the DOA concept. alnoet all of Dchida Yoko's sales will be OA
related, but here only the counter-related sales which say be thought to repre-
sent the sales of the central nucleus were extracted to portray the trends of
the «water industry depart-eat.

Uchida Yoko sells three original brands of counters—the brand ”ﬁrst." ”Seiko”
and "Faces." The sales of these coquters are: ”Due,” 58 percent; "Seiko,”

77

22 percent; and "Pacon." 10 percent; however. only the sales urgin of "Facon"
is included here.

The Dchida nicrocowuter school was set up in July. and the colpany plans to
develop a nationwide franchise chain of personal co-puter classroom.

Casio Calculator: Hope To Expand System Bquipnsnt

Casio Calculator is a comany which was established with the objective of develop-
ing relay-type calculators. which my be considered to be the infant model of

78

computers. This technology gave rise to the desk calculators. and this company
soon became the top maker in the field. The company also announced its Kanji
office computer "8-8700 series” 2 years ago and opened the way for the age of
Japanese language processing.

The desk calculator accounts for more than half of the total sales of this com-
pany. and this figure rises to over 90 percent if sales of the electronic watch
department are included. Although its computer department makes up only 10 per-
cent of this coIpany. its growth since the advent of Kenji office cosputer has
been spectacular. When this cowany's domestic business system was revised in'
January this year. reflecting the arrival of the 0A age. this department was
made one of the main pillars. This change divided this computer department into
two: the "Digital Equipment Sales Department" which sells desk calculators and
electronic watches which account for more than 90 percent of the total sales.
and the "System Equipment Business Department" which sells office computer.
This shows the company's solid resolution to promote office computer.

In May this year. Casio Calculator started to sell its small business computer
"8-7 series" which is designed for econnay. This is advertised as a desktop
type full-fledge business comuter which uses the same type hardware and soft-
ware as office computer. and it is provided with a package program which is
pointed toward gasoline station use.

In the area of facsimiles. in addition to its self-developed "Casio PAX 2000
series." it has the series of medium-speed to high-speed units which this com-
pany developed in cooperation with llitachi Limited. giving this company an
abundant array of equipment.

A Japanese word processor "Casio HP-l" was displayed at the business show held in
Hay this year. This unit can use any of 3 input modes: 1) the self-developed
Casio page tablet mode. 2) the Kans-Kanji interchangeable mode. and 3) the JIS 4
digit code input mode. Provisions have been made for the user to select which-
ever input mode he desires.

There has been talk that this cospsny is to start development on plain paper
copier. and it appears to be ready to go into all-out involvement in system
equipment in readiness for the 0A age.

Part III. Semiconductor Industry

[Article by computer/semiconductor journalist Tomio Uchida: "Real Strength
Diagnosis of Japan's Top Semiconductor Companies"]

[Text] The Japanese semiconductor IC industry. which the phrase "a pleasant
voyage with a favoring wind at the back" fits almost perfectly. while presently
undergoing a temporary cloudy situation as the result of unfavorable domestic and
foreign market environment. is still flourishing greatly as a basic industry for
the 1980's decade. Each of the top makers of semiconductor is a part of a leading
electronics company and is vertically integrated into the parent company. Thus.
they possess unique overall strength (capital. developmental technology. mass
production. manpower resources) not seen in foreign competitive mkers. and

are promoting a large-scale international market strategy.

has decreased from 60 percent to the SO-percent level since FY—79.)

Considerable changes in rank are seen in the next four companies which comprise
the middle level. Among these. the sales record of Fujitsu. which occupies
fourth rank. has shown increases of 97.6 percent and 59.3 percent for “-78 and

The top 10 companies have developed strong and well-ordered marketing practices.
but they all face common problems as they make the transition from this year to

the next. There is considerable possibility that the counter policies and their
execution with respect to these problems so important to the re market strategy

will greatly influence the directions of these 10 companies. The problems which
will be faced are summarized in the following six examples.

Supply and demand of certain types of 1c will vary with diversified product
demand and supply: During the first part of this year. the IC market for desk
calculators and watches was facing a dull business. while. on the other hand. IC
for home-use VTR was experiencing an explosive demand. The makers are forced to
estimate just how much demand for microcomputer and audio synthesizer LSI will
increase for computer use (PA equipment and personal computers).

Timing of mass produced L51 memory replacement: The 66-K dynamic RAH (instant
write-in and readout memory. which is expected to burst into its growth period
in 1982. is presently undergoing a large reduction in price. ("here it cost
20,000 yen per unit last fall. it cost 2.000 yen per unit this September.) It
is urgently necessary to develop a plastic package type (low—cost type). to
establish a mass production and delivery system in line with the market situa-
tion and to lower its price per bit to match that of the 16-K DRAM by the end of
1982.

Responding to the dizzy changes in the IC trade: The 10 trade with the United
States. which had just begun to be black last year. once more turned red during
the first half (January-June) of this year. The business recession in the United
States and the accompanying stagnation of the 10 market (particularly in the

lo-K DRAM) is the underlying cause. Finally. in September some signs of recovery
began to appear. Be that as it may. development of domestic demand and establish-
ment of sales systems will probably be necessary for the time being in order to
cover this lag in exports.

Promotion of "mutual entry competition" with foreign capital: Both Japan TI and
Japan IBM are making good progress with their VLSI mass-production plants. and
at the end of September the world's second largest semiconductor maker. Notorola.
announced plans to set up a VLSI production plant. (Oita Prefecture in Kyushu
is at present the leading choice.) 0n the American side, there are other com-
panies such as Fairchili and ADM which are eyeing possible 16 production in
Japan. On the other side of the coin. Japanese companies including Nippon
Electric. Hitachi. Toshiba and Fujitsu are digging in their spurs to finance

the establishment of production sites in the United States.

Ic import duty will be lowered to 4.2 percent starting next year: Put in the
simplest terms. this is an advantageous change for the American 10 maker in his
entry into the Japanese market. The Japanese must maintain their sales routes

83
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

within the United States through reinforced mass production of 16 in the United
States in order to erase trade friction with the United States.

Pursuit of medium-size IC makers emerging with unique individual products: Com-
panies which make IC for intracompany use or make custom/semicustom 16 as their
specialty are increasing. This is a market whose scale is not very large. but
it is an area of large growth rate, and it is viewed that the top semiconductor
IC makers will inevitably enter into it.

Profile of Top Five Companies
Nippon Electric

According to a survey compiled by the Dataquest Company of the United States. in
FY-80 the rc production record of Nippon Electric. which is Japan's top semi-
conductor maker. was second only to Texas Instruments (TI) of the United States
throughout the world, and when individual semiconductors are included. it ranked
third behind TI and Motorola. The "Production Trends in the Electronic Device
Area" and "Increased LSI Production Plan" which this company released in May of
this year are given in Table 36 and Table 37.

A non! of BOO-billion-yen production is seen for the entire electronic device
area. and the mainstay here is the 1C (190 billion yen) which includes micon
(microprocessor). memory. desk-calculator use LSl and watch-use LSI; in the lat-
ter area the long period of reduced production on the part of watchmakers such as
Casio and Seiko are taking effect. so the sales for the second half of FY-Bl are
expected to decrease about 10 percent below last year.

In another direction. the micon (particularly the 8-bit and the 16-bit) is play-
ing the tractor role for semiconductor products. while production of the highly
visible memory, the 64-K DRAM. is planned to be "frozen" at the 200,000 to
300,000 units/month level, at least until the latter half of next year. at

which time the computer makers who are the prime customers (market) will complete

in the United States has been languishing and a situation of oversupply has
existed since the end of last year. but about the end of August Nippon Electric
judged that the oversupply situation in the United States no longer existed. and
it restored its production scale. which had been in a state of temporary cut-
back (1.6 million units/month). to the top monthly production level of 3 million
units/month (Kyushu Nichiden 1.6 million. American NEC Electronics 900.000.

Judging that VTR and 0A will be the prime movers of the entire semiconductor
demand. increased production of micon and linear IC has becone the main force in
the FY-8l plan. Sample delivery of the 16-bit 68000 micon was initiated in the
first half of the year. and this product is expected to see increased demand.
There has been a sharp increase in demand Ior linear 10 since the start of this
year for use in television. audio equipment. VTR/disk and automobiles. This
company. which is the top naker of linear IC for VTR use. is expected to increase
production.

In the area of the 64-K DRAM. which is expected to be the mainstay of the next
generation memory. in October this company sc<3ped all other companies by enter-
ing into a mass-production/salos system for plastic sealed units. In the past.
this company used ceramic and cer-DIP (glass) as sealing material for the 66-!
DRAM. but it is now increasing its plastic—sealed unit production with superior
productivity. reliability and cost factor (production cost can be lowered by
about.100 yen/unit over ceramic). and 10-20 percent of its production is expected
to be plastic sealed by the end of the year. During the latter half of FY-Bl.
Hitachi is expected to increase production of the 6b-K DRAM at its Husashi plant

to 700.000 units/month. In addition. the Kofu branch plant in Yamansshi Pre-
fecture is expected to begin production of the same RAM in the next fiscal
year, and the 64-K DRAM production capacity is expected to break the million
units/month level after the next fiscal year; this company seems about to take
the lead role in this area.

Toshiba

Toshiba during the latter half of this fiscal year (September-March) is reinforc-
ing the production systems at its Oita plant with the latest L81 production line
which was completed in July. and at its Kitakyushi plant (bipolar 10 mass pro-
duction base) which is a transistor plant refurbished with a clean room. and it
is going into all-out development in order to achieve its goal of 170 billion

yen in sales. The market it seeks is the semiconductor for consumer goods such
as the VTR audio line. for which high demand is expected to continue. and the com-
puter (0A equipment) area; these are the areas where this company is expected to
focus its attention. The important item for the latter half will be micon

market development. where a monthly production of 1 million units is being sought
including CHOS micon for automobile use.

"here memory is concerned. plans are underway to promote strengthening dynamic

RAH production, an item which accounts for half of the market. (The combined pro-
duction of its Oita plant and Toshiba Semiconductor USA is expected to reach

1 million bé-K DRAM units/month this year.) On the other hand, the price of this
RAH dropped even before it entered mass production. and this company is expected
to concentrate on its specialty area of static RAH (lo-K. 64-!) while waiting

to see how the market performs.

Fujitsu

Just as with the top three companies. Fujitsu had good sales record through the
first half of FY-8l (April-September) with respect to semiconducturs for pri-
vate use VTR and semiconductors in the computer related 0A area. This compen—
sated for the poor record of the memory department where sales increased but
price dropped. and sales total dropped. 0n the contrary. in the latter half of
the year. the company hopes for success in a logic product. the 16-bit micon
(8086). whose sample was shipped out starting in September. followed by the 8-bit
micon (8048. 8049). the popular bipolar high-speed memory and PROM in the memory-
products area. and the Japanese Kanji ROM for DA systems.

The company is continuing mass production of the 16-K DRAM. which seems to be
returning to market stability in the area of the dynamic RAM. but price competi-
tion in the éa-K DRAM is so fierce so that this company is preparing a set-up
which can start mass production at any time while keeping a watchful eye on the
market situation during the latter half of the year. Haas production of the
64-K has been increased to a monthly output of 300.000 units from 150,000 units
in June. and the plan is to increase this production to 600.000 units by the end
of next year. It is thought that this company together with Hitachi will serve
as the prime movers for mass production of the 64-K DRAM.

Matsushita Electronic posted the enviable record of 50 percent increase in
sales over the previous period. to 56.6 billion yen during the first half
(January-June) of FY-Bl. It is aiming at a 20-percent increase to 65.5 billion
yen during the second half. and it hopes to attain a 50-percent increase over
the next year to 120 billion yen throughout this fiscal year.

This company's plans for increased semiconductor production (FY-80 to FY-Sl) are
shown in Table 38; spectacular increases are seen in IC, discrete (individual)
elements and micons. The growth of the micon sales of this company, which is
said to hold 40 percent of the 16-bit market share. is tremendous within the
framework of this plan; the company's micon production already exceeded the
yearend goal of 2 million units to 2.56 million units by a little after the
middle of the year. and this total is expected to come up to 3 million by the
end of the year.

‘Hlis company's investments in semiconductor installations to back up its plans
for increnscd production totaled 22 billion yen in FY-81, the same as in the
preceding fiscal year. These investments are directed at the new construction
of a VLSI Business Department (Kyoto Nagaoka plant) in February (plans are to
produce 1.5-2 million VLSI by end of the year) and the expansion of the Arai
plant in Niigstn (monthly production of 40 million 1C possible in September.
currently producing 2 million LSI).
