[Text] The Soviet people heve greeted the 26th CPSU Congress with s treeendous po-
litical end lshor upsurge. Inspired by the resolutions of the congress. workers in
our country hsve begun carrying out the 11th Five-Yesr Plen. we ere fsced with s
greet desl of work on further inproving the econoeic eechsnisn so es to correspond
better to the present level of productive forces during this period.

The CPSU Centrsl Co-ittee end 0883 Council of Ministers Decree "0n Improving Plen-
ning end Strengthening the Influence of the Bcononic Hechsnisn on Ieproving Produc-
tion Efficiency end work Quslity" outlined the chsnge-over of sll construction nin-

Production unite are denied legal independence. that is. they do not have the right
to conclude egreenents in their own names. cost accounting is into-plate end their
rights are restricted. This will nuke its mark on organizing the planning and re-
cording of production unit activity indicators. The Iain indicators of construction
association activity will be: start-up of production capacities and projects; volume
of connodity construction output; labor productivity growth; [observing] linits on
the number of workers and enployees; total wage fund; profit (or reduction in con-
struction-installation work net cost); assign-ant on introducing new equip-ant; vol-

ume of deliveries of materials. nachinery. Inchines and other material-technical re-
sources.

Other indicators which assume an econonic interest in attaining the connon goal of
improving production efficiency euet be communicated to the production unite conpria-
ing associations and operating on an internal cost-accounting basis. Such indicators
night include: use of fixed and circulating capital; linits on numbers of workers;
wage fund; labor productivity growth; production outlays.

It is inappropriate to plan the indicators of connodity output. profit and profit-
ability for production units. since these indicators are not associated with the ac-
tivity of the letter. but depend on the operation of the association as a whole.

The efficiency of the production units is evaluated using such indicators as return
on capital. labor productivity. expenditures per ruble of comaodity output and per-
centage plan fulfillment for putting production capacities and facilities into oper-
ation.

One feature of the activity of production associations is the centralisation of nany
production activity functions of the production units. Thus. for exenple. credit-
calculation relations have been centralised and are being done entirely through pro-
duction association accounts - current account. production develop-ant fund account.
loan accounts. Crediting can be effected for seasonal or other above-nornative
stocks of connodity-naterial values. for expenditures on introducing new equip-ant
and improving technology. for seasonal shortfalls in depreciation deductions for as-
jor overhauls. for making up shortfalls in own circulating capital, and so forth.

All production units are being changed over to a centralised procedure for credit-
ing and calculations. In place of current. loan and other accounts. current ac-

counts are being opened for then to pay wages. bonuses and asks paynenta fron the
enterisl incentives fund.

Contracts with suppliers to deliver nateriels. equipnent and other goods for the pro-
duction units are concluded by the production-technological equip-ant set-ordering
adninistration. which has an independent budget and is a structural unit of the as-
sociation. The UYTK [production-technological equipment set-ordering edsinistra-
tion] is responsible for neteriel-technical supply for all subdivisions of the pro-
duction association. Calculations with suppliers are done using the association's
current account. through the UPTK.

The financial operations of the association and the production units conprising it
are effected through the association current account (recording revenues fro. the
sale of construction output. naterial values and fixed assets; transferring funds
to the Stroybenk to finance capital invest-ants; calculations for redistributing
circulating capital and profit within the systes; paying supplier accounts for us-
terials and services to associations which lack UPTK' 3 paying off loans and bank
credits; centralized calculations with the budget for all types of pay-ants; trans-
ferring funds to the current accounts of production units for issuing wages and for
other expenses. and so forth).

For the production units. current accounts are being opened for: entering funds
received fron the association for paying wages. bonuses. tenporary disability
grants. paynents on account and other payasnts; transferring taxes and withholdings
from workers and eaployees. payaents for aunicipal and printing services. pay-ants
for acquiring authorisations for trips to health resorts and recreation centers or
for acquiring sporting goods using econonic incentives and other funds.

Calculations with suppliers for saall deliveries of materials and services to pro-
duction units should he asde independently. by check. fron unlinited check hooks
issued by the association and paid fron the association loan account fron worksin-
progress accounts. All other calculations for asterials goods lust he nade through
the UTPK's. -

Calculations for output. asteriala and services between production units are re-
flected in account No 79. "lntrasysten Accounts." and are not reflected in the cur-
rent account of the association.

Calculations with the budget are reflected under centralised procedures for the as-
sociation as a whole. Such calculations include pay-ants for production funds. free
carry-over profit. savings fron lowering expenditures on asintaining the adsinistra-
tive-aanageaent apparatus. Production units have a separate balance which reflects
such operations as calculations with the association on allocated fixed and circulat-
ing capital, production expenditures. expenses of future periods. aonetery leans.
calculations with workers and enployees. calculations with social insurance agencies
and calculations with debtors and creditors.

Production units subnit balances to the association at the established tines; these
are used as a basis for coapiling a sulnary balance for the association as a whole.
Operations on the state fund account (increase or decrease) are centralised and re-
corded in the association's accounting departnent. which also handles calculations
with production units on allocated fixed and circulating capital. calculations with
clients and suppliers in a production-unit cross-section. intrasysten accounts. re-
cording current account operations. recording loans and credits. recording financial
results. recording calculations with the budget. recording econonic incentives funds.
target financing and target receipts. recording diverted funds. recording the depre-
ciation fund and its use, and others.

Itshouldbe noted that the creation of an association will pernit inprovsnent in

[Article by V. Krenyanskiy: ”Change In Construction Cost"!

[Text] The development of capital construction in the 1970's did not fully nest the
denands of intensifying the econony. The aaounts and share of capital investnente
going not to increase econonic potential. but to coepensate for increased construc-
tion costs. grew constantly. In the 10th Pive-Yeer Plan. given continuing growth in
capital investnents in a nunber of breaches. there wee an absolute reduction in the
start-up of capacities. and the everege yearly start-up of capacities for producing
electric power. iron, steel and finished rolled netal. for coal lining and enrich-cot
and for producing cellulose. paper. cardboard. knitwear and footuesr was lower in
1976-1979 than in the Eighth Five-Year Plan.

The increased cost per unit of new capacity is one reason for the deterioration in
indicators of specific capitol invest-ants on output and production capital-intensive-
neas.

The rate of increnent in production capital invaetnents exerts a great influence on
the cost of output increnent: in the Eighth and Ninth five-year plans. the average
yearly rate of inth was about eight percent; in the Ninth five-Year Plan. it
dropped to 5.5 percent. In this regard. the rate of growth in capital invest-ants
to reccepense withdrawals and maintain capacities not rise. since it depends largely
on the anount of fixed production assets and their service life. In 1970. the value
of fixed production assets was 531 billion rubles; in 1979 - 1.076 trillion rubles
(a 2.03-fold increase). Production capital investnenta increased free 61.9 to 106.9
billion rubles. 1.73-fold. during that period. that is. the rate of growth in capital
investments lagged behind the rate of growth in fixed assets. This led to a reduc-
tion in the share of net capital investnant goim to increase assets and capacities.
If the withdrawal of assets decreases in a given period. this is conpensatad for in
a subsequent period by a higher rate of withdrawal. Consequently, the price of in-
creasing a unit of capacity and output has a tendency to rise given lowering rates of
growth in gross capital investeents. The objective character of the increasing cost
of increasing capacities and output is not associated with the increasing cost of new
production capacities and nonproduction facilities or with growth in the capital-
intensiveness of production. Deternining the rate of cost increase per unit of ca-
pacity is conplicated prinarily by two factors: change in the branch structure of
capacities start-up and price.

A conparison of branch capital investnents and start-ups of traditional production
capacities does not indicate that the cost of a unit of capacity is increasing.

since the list of capacities is constantly changing. especially in types of produc-
tion nost associated with scientific and technical progress. Given overall growth

of 1.7-fcld in rolled ferrous metals during 1966-1979. the production of rolled low-
alloy steels and rolled heat-hardened natal increased three-fold. production of thin-
sheet. cold-rolled steel - two fold. and production of curved shaped - seven-fold.
Given a 1.2-fold growth in eachine tool production during 1970-1979. the production of
nachine tools with numerical preset control increased five-fold and that of autonatic
and seaiautonatic lines - 1.4-fold.

Using conparable or unchanged prices when calculating capital investnent and fixed
assets volunes does not enable us to judge change in the price of identical capaci-
ties nade on the basis of the exact sane planning resolutions. The distortion pro-
duced by conparable prices is indicated by recalculating the cost of capacities put
into operation in 1951-1965 to 1969 prices. Thus. the valuation of capacities put
into operation in 1951-1955 increases by 63.7 percent. that of those tron 1956-1960
- 36.1 percent. and that of those free 1961-1965 - 17.6 percent. The price per
square neter of total housing space increased 32.6 percent in 1969-1970 as conpared
with 1966-1968. After 1969. in spite of the fact that there were no significant
price changes. the cost of a unit of capacity continued to rise. In housing con-
struction. the price per square neter of usable space increased during 1971-1979
froa 126.8 to 170.9 rubles. or 36.8 percent. which is 3.4 percent per year.

In industrial construction. the rate of increase in the cost of a unit of capacity
we calculate to be 2.5 to three percent a year. sonewhat sore if the absolute and
relative growth in unfinished construction is taken into account. The higher rate
of growth in the cost of housing and nonproduction construction is to be explained
by the lower share of equipment in the estimated cost of construction. a total of
5-10 percent. as conpared with 35-60 percent in industrial construction. Calcula-
rions nade on the basis of capital intensiveness and degree of updating of industrial

fixed production assets also testify to similar rates of increase in the cost of in-
dustrial construction. During 1971-1979. capital intensiveness increased 1.7 percent
per year. but in 1976-1979 - 2.4 percent. that is. the rate of increase in the cost
of a unit of capacity in industry reached approximtely five percent a year in the
10th Five-Year Plan.

"hat are the reasons for the increasing cost of construction. even in conparahle
prices? In the Eighth Five-Year Plan. the cost of capacities increased by 15-20
percent sore than when recalculated using indexes in conparable prices in connection
with the higher level of estinated prices; environ-ental protection and labor protec-
tion expenditures increased; the share of capital investnents directed into the north-
ern and eastern regions increased. These additional expenditures were included in
the initial base adopted for subsequent calculations of change in the cost of a unit
of capacity. in the Ninth Five-Year Plan. the inpact of the 1969 price increase
continued to be felt. since the review of plans and estimates contimad. In the

10th Five-Year Plan. a sajority of these factors were no longer operative. To the
contrary. the overall level of estimated prices was approxinately two percent lower
in the 10th Five-Year Plan than in the Ninth as a result of the reduction in equip-
nent prices in 1973 and the 1976 lowering of the level of estimated prices for con-
struction-installation work.

The cost of a unit of capacity is coaprised basically of two parts -- expenditures
on construction-installation work and expenditures on equipoent. To reveal the rea-
sons for the increasing cost of a unit of capacity. we need to analyze each of these
components of its cost.

The highest level of increase in the cost of construction-installation work was in
1969-1970. when new unit rates and notes of general overheads and planned acctnula-
tions were established as part of estissted cost and construction worker wages were
increased. Cost-increase indexes were set at 1.22 to 1.28 with consideration of
these factors. sonswhat higher for individual branches. However. the actual increase
in cost turned out to be considerably greater.

Analysis enables us to establish the reasons for the outstripping increase in the
cost of the passive portion of assets as conpared with growth in estinated prices.
Prices increased nost -- 50-55 percent - for trans buildings. as cospsred with 30-
40 percent for other types of buildings. The increnent in production space occurred
basically through frane buildings. a square aster of which is 28 percent more expen-
sive than in unfraned brick. large-panel and prefabricated-slab buildings. The
changeover in rural construction fron buildings nade of local construction naterials
to ones made of prefabricated reinforced concrete conponents resulted in a two-fold
or greater increase in the cost of a unit of space.

The continuing development of capacities to produce prefabricated reinforced concrete
conponents and the increase in their share of construction naterials apparently leads
to further growth in the cost of construction-installation work per unit of building
space.

The rates of reduction in the production of cement and glass per million rubles of
construction-installation work (in spite of the constantly growing share of glassed
surfaces) testifies to the scale of the price increase per unit of construction out-
put cost consumed. The rate of cost increase was highest in the Eighth Five-Year
Plan. It dropped sonewhat in the Ninth and rose again in the 10th (see Table 3).

The following is one inportant reason for the increase in the cost of the passive
portion of fixed assets. The policy adopted in the 1950's of extensively developing
and widely using prefabricated reinforced concrete. given a low technical level of
brick and monolithic concrete production. persitted a substantial rise is labor pro-
ductivity in construction. in spite of the fact that it was inefficient to replace
individual steel conponents. In the first stage of its industrialisation. the in-
crease in construction costs was considered a tenporary phenonenon. however. no re-
duction in construction cost occurred over the following decades.

At present. significant schievenente in brick production technology have enabled us
to increase labor productivity in the branch. The use of progressive netth of
working with concrete have increased the national-econonic effectiveness of nonoli—
thic conponents as cospsred with prefabricated ones. Ivan in seienic cones. con-
struction using nonolithic reinforced concrete is nost promising and profitable:
capital inveatnents in the production base are 3043 percent lover. 20-25 percent
less steel is used (as cospared with large-panel houses) and overall expenditures
are 7-8 percent lower. Nonetheless. nonolithic reinforced concrete buildings are
being put up only experieantally. The rain indicators of technical progress con-
tinue to be the production and use of prefabricated reinforced concrete. degree of
prefabrication. and so forth. As before. long-range developnente anticipate the con-
tinued developnent of the prefabricated reinforced concrete industry.

The outstripping rates of developnent of the branch as cupared with the rates of
growth in the start-up of capacities and in construction-installation vork volt-es
testify to the nature of the technical policy in construction. In 1976-1979. given
an average annual rate of increnent in gross construction output of 2.6 percent and
in labor productivity of 2.2 percent. the rates of increnent in fixed production as-
sets were 10.5 percent. capital-intensivenese - 7.6 percent. capital availability
-- nine percent and nachinery availability - seven percent. Circulating capital
increased fron 19.3 to 78.7 billion rubles free 1970 through 1979. enceeding the
annual volune of contractor work. Vitbout taking unfinished construction production

into account. circulating capital increased froe 16.‘ to 39.6 billion rubles. or
2.6-fold. with a construction voluae growth of 1.6-fold. that is. circulating capital
was growing 1.5-fold faster than the work volt-e.

The existing price-setting procedure facilitates growth in the aaterials-intensive-
ness and cost of construction (the procedure for determining the estiaated cost of
construction-installation work). under which general overheads are calculated for
the entire sum of direct expenditures. and planned accumulations are calculated for
the total direct expenditures and general overheads. Each ruble of increase in
prices for esterials or growth in naterial expenditures without any effort being put
out by the builders provides them an additional 25-30 kopecks in the wege fund. ap-
proxiaately as much in profit. and 8-10 kopecks in the econoric incentives fund.
Growth in naterials intensivenass is also facilitated by the decreasing (since the
mid-1960's) attention paid to construetion-installation work net cost. But in fact.
material expenditures comprise more than half the net cost of construction.

The CPSU Central Coamittee and USS! Council of Ministers Decree "0n Improving Plan-
ning and Strengthening the Influence of the Economic Mechanism on Improving Produc-
tion Efficiency and work Quality" outlines a change-over in industry to the indica-
tor of net (normative) output. A sinilsr price-setting procedure auat be introduced
into construction as well. however. the latest USSR Gosstroy normative docunents1
for the new eetieated prices being prepared anticipate the old procedure for calcu-
lating general overheads and planned accumulations. which will lead to further growth
in the materials-intensiveness and cost of construction and will not help elininate
differing work profitability in the initial and concluding stages of construction.

Profit and profitability level play an iaportant role in the cost of a unit of capa-
city. Today. this econoeic lever stimulates not a reduction in the cost of a unit
of capacity. but an increase in it. After estimated prices were introduced in 1969.
profitability in construction dropped sharply: froe 6.8 percent in 1968 to 15.9 per-
cent in 1975 and 12.5 percent in 1979.2 given a planned accumulations noreative of
six percent of the net cost of construction-installation work. Actual profit ex-
ceeds by 2.5-fold the nornative of planned accumulations. which is one of the price-
forming factors in construction output. During 1971-1975. contractor organization
profits fron releasing projects were 36.5 billion rubles. as compared with 15.6 bil-
lion rubles under the nornntive. During 1976-1979. profit was 33.2 billion rubles.
as against a normative of 16.3 billion.

The high profit in construction distorts the actual cost of newly created fixed as-
sets. lowers return on capital and increases the net cost of output in all branches

1See: "0n the Conposition of Expenditures Relating to Normative Hypothetically-Net
Output in Construction" (EKONOHIKA STROITEL'STVA. No 6. 1980. p 51).

2The reduction in profit and profitability in 1976-1979 resulted free the introduc-

tion as of 1 January 1976 of a construction-installation work estimated cost reduc-
tion factor equalling 0.991 for industrial construction and from a significant re-

duction in the increment in construction-installation work; in 1979. even the abso-
lute amounts of such work decreased by 0.6 billion rubles. given continuing growth

in fixed production assets and the availability of anchinery to labor.

of the national economy. During 1971-1979 alone. the cost of new fixed assets was
overstated by 39 billion rubles for this reason. Given a substantial exceeding of
normative construction schedules. so large an inflation of normative profit testifies
to shortcomings in 1969 unit rates and to the fact that the reviews of estimated cost
were unsubstantiated in a nuaber of instances.

Nor-stive profit must be achieved on the condition that all nornative paraneters are
met. including construction schedules and quality. cpenditures of materials and
wages. use of machinery. and so forth. Unjuatified profit growth results in the
creation of conditions for high losses of construction materials. poorer use of con-
struction nachinery and equipment. significant legs in labor productivity growth be-
hind growth in capital availability. and outstripping wage growth as compared with
labor productivity. During 1965-1979. the average wage of workers employed in con-
struction-installation jobs increased 87 percent. but labor productivity increased
72 percent. Since 1965. the average wage in construction has been higher than in
other branches of the national economy.

The 26th CPSU Congress set as the basic task of construction increasing production
potential on a new technical basis and installing housing. nunicipal- and cultural-
services. social and cultural projects. The economic incentives nechanisa must also
facilitate this. However. over the past 10 years. bonus funds have grown not only
faster than the introduction of fixed assets. but also faster than profit. At the
sane tine. total bonuses for putting projects into operation have increased consi-
derably more slowly than total bonuses and comprise about one percent of the wage
fund. while they should be sore than 10 percent. according to the normative. given
that construction schedules are met.

The formation and use of economic incentives funds does not depend in practice on
putting fixed assets into operation. what is being stimulated is not the start-up
of assets. but profit. including so-called unrealized profit. that is. profit on un-
finished construction. Moreover. it is now permitted to award bonuses through pro-
fit amounts established for putting production capacities and construction projects
into operation in the form of an advance. given planned construction durations of
sore than six months. This is a deviation froa the basic demand on bonuses. that
they stimulate and results. and not individual intermediate stages of construction.

The rise in the share of equipnent expenditures in total capital invest-ant value
and the increased cost of a unit of capacity have been the occasion for dissuination
of the opinion that the nain reason for the increasing cost of capacities is the out-
stripping growth in the cost of equipnent as conparcd with its productivity. The
rates of growth in equipnent expenditures exceed nearly l.5-fold the rates of growth
in construction-installation work. In this regard. actual capital invutnents in
equipnent exceeded planned investaents in the 10th Five-Year Plan.

The increase in expenditures on equipnent is a natural phenonenon. Increasing inten-
sification of the reproduction process requires qualitative change in the process of
updating fixed assets. The growing snounts of capital investment are accoepsnied by
increasingly snaller increeents in fixed assets. This relates forenost to the active

portion of fixed assets. whose share of fixed assets withdrawals is constantly grow-
ing.

In would seen that. given the increase in expenditures on equipment and on replacing
old equipment with new and what many specialists consider to be lore expensive equip-
ment. given the constant growth in saturation with couples equipnent. devices. auto-
mated lines. conputer equipsent. and so forth. the proportion of the active portion
of assets in total fixed production assets nust grow. however. that has not happened
during the past 15 years. According to USSR Central Statistical Administration data.
the proportion of the active portion of assets in industry was. at the start of each
year (in percent):
1966 1971 1975 1976 1979 1980

38.2 39.2 38.2 38.1 38.5 39.8

Thus. whereas the cost of equipnent did increase, the outstripping increase in the
cost of construction-installation work and the passive portion of fixed assets did
not permit the share of the active portion in total production assets to grow as it
should have.

The relationship of the cost and productivity of new equipnent being produced to re-
place old equipment is of inportant significance in the cost dynanics of a unit of
capacity. In the opinion of a nunber of specialists. the outstripping growth in
prices as compared with productivity has been a factor directly corresponding to
growth in the cost of a unit of capacity. however. that does not take into account
the fact that the cost of capacities consists of the active and passive portions of
assets. and that the active portion -- nachinsry and equip-ent - conprisee only 60
percent of the total cost of the assets. hence. the fact that the cost of equipoent
outstrips. within certain linits. growth in equip-ant productivity does not cause an
increase in the cost of a unit of capacity. Thus. given a three-fold increase in
the price of new equipnent and a two-fold increase in productivity relative to that
being replaced. the ratio of price to productivity is 1.5 : 1. But even this growth
in the cost of a unit of equipment productivity does not cause the cost of a unit of
capacity to rise in branches replacing old and less-productive equith with new.
but sore expensive equipment if the passive portion of the assets is not replaced.

m----------.---_

1This is obvious from a sinple calculation: the cost of fixed assets prior to re-
placenent was 100 units (60 passive + 1.0 active). After replacenent. it was 180
units (60 + 120). but capacity increases two-fold in accordance with the increased
equipment productivity.

when old equipnent is replaced with new. the overall cost of the fixed assets grows
by 80 percent. but their productivity (capacity) increases by 100 percent. The cost
of a unit of capacity (which coincides with capital intensiveness in this instance)
decreases fron l to 0.9. and the return on capital increases fron 1 to 1.11. But
this is true only if the productivity of the new equip-ant is fully used.

The appropriateness of replacing old equipnent with new. sore expensive and nore pro-
ductive. without increasing the cost of a unit of capacity, can be expressed in its
general torn by the formula:

I! - 100 > P

S - 100 - '

where N is the capacity of the enterprise after equipnent replacement. in percent of
base capacity; 8 is the price of the new equipment. in percent of the price of base

equipment; P is the replacesent equipnent's share of overall fixed assets in terns of
cost. The relationship of incresent in enterprise capacity to increnent in the cost

of the replacement equipment lust be not less than the replacenent equipnent's share
of the overall cost of fixed assets.

The relationships presented for replacing base equip-eat with new and sore expensive
equipnent provide an idea of how the type structure of fixed production assets nust
change. In the given hypothetical example. the share of the passive portion of the
assets decreases from 60 to 33 percent after equipnent replacment, and the share of
the active portion increases free to to 67 percent. However. this does not renove
the question of the necessity of constantly inproving the relationship between the
prices and productivity of new equip-eat. Lowering the cost of a unit of capacity is
not facilitated either by the "Instructions on Procedures for Setting Incentive Sur-
charges to Wholesale Prices" approved by the State Price Cos-ittee on 27 love-bet
1979,1 which sets the price surcharge at 70 percent of the total inpact. At the
same tine. the inpact of that share of the total sun on equipnent productivity growth
averages about 15 percent. These enable us to consider efficient equipment even less

productive than the base equipment. if the calculations show a savings of current op-
erating expenditures.

A sanple survey showed that price linits only substantiate the appropriateness of re-
leasing new output. while prices for it are set in the traditional way -- net cost

plus a set percentage of profitability. Profitability is set at the noraative level.
which is considerably below the actual level for output in use. In this regard. even
incentive price surcharges do not nake new output sore profitable for the nsnufactur-
ing plants. Replacing output in use with newer and less profitable output worsens

enterprise econonic indicators and consequently puts obstacles in the path of intro-
ducing it. Thus. above-nonnative profitability in nachine building also has a nega-
tive inpact on technical progress. Of course, the "profitability" of new output can
be improved over that of output in use by setting a higher profitability for the new
output, but that evokes a response throughout the entire reproduction chain: equip-
nent increases in cost. the cost of new capacities increases. net cost increases in

machine building and other production branches - prices rise in nachina building.
and so on.

At the start of 1980. sons 20-25 billion of the 106.6 billion rubles of unfinished
construction was above-norsative. The outstripping growth in unfinished construction

As is evident from Table 5. the increase in the cost of construction during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan due just to the increment in "unfinisheds" was 6.9 percent. and in the
10th - 5.9 percent (13.8 and 21 percent. respectively. for chemical end petrochemi-
cal industry).

In working out plans, new construction is limited. and its estimated cost is set in
significantly lower amounts than the start-up of fixed assets. However. total esti-
mated cost increases each year. as does the volume of work subject to completion.
Analysis shows that the increment in carry-over estimated cost. along with the incre-
ment in unfinished construction. it to be explained by the fact that there is consi-
dersbly more new construction than was plann . In order to keep carry-over estimated
cost at approximately a constant level. we need to reduce new construction projects
by 8-10 billion rubles of estimated cost per year.

Along with reducing the new construction front. we should eliminate the possibility
that it will be run under the cover of a review of plans and estimates. Thus. the
Ministry of Electrification and Power Engineering. with the concurrence of the USSR
Gosplan and Gosstroy. included the III and IV overfall 688's when it reviewed the
Inguri CBS estimate; the USSR Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy included construction
of two convector shops and an oxygen unit in the construction plan for Mizhne-Iagil'
Metallurgical Combine. and so forth. Individual departments do large amounts of new
construction. relying on plan review. In 1976-1979. the construction front was
broadened by 75 percent for the Ministry of Automotive Industry. by 35 percent for
the Ministry of Chemical Industry and by 33 percent for the Ministry of Ferrous Me-
tallurgy through the re-approval of existing estimates.

This practice conflicts with established procedure. under which reviewing plans in
connection with further expanding and renovating enterprises after the first lines
have been started up is done as in the case of new construction, and estimated for
capacities and projects which have been put into operation must be closed. regardless
of estimate limit carry-over. "hen this procedure is followed. total estimated cost
more accurately reflects the actual amount of capital construction in the country.

Scattering means has to hamper the procedute set up in 1969 for planning on the ba-
sis of titles lists of new construction approved with a breakedcwn by year in accord
with construction duration norms. however. the ministries and contractor departnents
have failed to follow this procedure from the first year of construction. in spite of
the normative allocation of resources. In the second and subsequent years. contrac-
tors and clients agree in the titles lists for carry-over projects to work volumes
which are considerably smaller than was anticipated at the start of construction.

The carry-over capital invest-eats thus generated are directed into new construction.
including through estimates with limit carry-overs.

A CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers decree (of July 1979) confirms
the previously established procedure for financing construction projects in strict
accord with the titles lists for new construction and instructs the USSR Gosbenk and
Stroybsnk to finance construction sites and projects following the indicated procedure.

The increase in costs which occurs during the course of construction undermines the
planning principle in economic activity. helps generate disproportions in the start-
up of related capacities. and stretches out the construction time for those projects
at whose expense the capital construction resources are being redistributed. Review-
ing estimated cost basically concerns construction projects close to completion. and
a shortage of capital investments for them creates objective conditions for failing
to carry out the start-up plan. which in turn forces administrators to decrease the
withdrawal of obsolete assets from the production process. Thus. the withdrawal fac-
tor was l.5-fold lower in the 10th Five-Year Plan than in the Eighth. A reduction

in withdrawal leads to additional expenses in operating obsolete means of labor, to
diverting additional manpower to them. and to failure to meet labor productivity
growth assignments and. correspondingly. output production growth assignments.

Analysis of the development of capital construction in the 10th Five¥Yesr Plan per-
mice the conclusion that none of its participants are economically interested todsy
in lowering estimated cost. since activity is evaluated and bonuses are awarded on
the basis of indicators deter-ined by the estimate. The higher it is. the higher
the evaluation and the bonus.

The dynamics of the components of the cost of a unit of capacity show that we need
to direct our primary efforts towards lowering the cost of construetion-installation
work. of a unit of construction output consumed cost. of each square and cubic meter
of building. of equipment installation. of a kilometer of utilities. roads. convey-
ance. and so forth. and not the million construction-installation jobs. Along with
this, we need to continue improving equipnent. increasing the usable impact of its
use and raising the share of the impact of productivity growth.

L. I. Brezhnev pointed out at the 26th CPSU Congress that: "Solving the problems
facing us and using the opportunities available to us depend largely on the level of
leadership of the national economy. on the level of planning and management." In ca-
pital construction. the management level should obviously be raised along the follow-
ing lines.

In the area of technical policy. we need to make adjust-eats in the policy of the
preferential development of prefabricated reinforced concrete. to change the indica-
tors of technical progress in construction. It is not the degree of prefabrication
and number of cubic meters of components per 1.000 square meters of space that eust
determine technical progress in construction. but the reduction in expenditures of
social labor, reduction in the cost per square meter of space or unit of capacity
while improving quality. Construction technology (prefabricated reinforced concrete
components. wood components. monolithic components. and so on) can very in each in-
dividual instance. but the result must be the same - reduced cost per unit of ca.
pacity or unit of other useful impact.

The CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers Decree "0n Intensifying
work on Saving Raw Material. Fuel. Energy and Other Haterial Resources and Using
Then Efficiently” recognised the necessity of approving in the five-year and annual
plans. beginning in 1983. assignments on output (work) net cost and. as part of
those assignments. limits on material expenditures in monetary terms per ruble of
output (work). This will facilitate squeezing out materials-intensive prefabricated
reinforced concrete components by other structural materials. which will in the end
lower the cost of construction.

In the area of the management mechanism, one urgent task is that of bringing titles

lists into line with available resources. We also need to fully inventory all con-
struction sites and titles lists. to close estimates for finished capacities and pro-
jects which have been put into operation. and to establish the actual volumes of work
to be done under approved plans and estimates. Us should no longer permit estimated
costs to be reviewed in connection with planning subsequent construction stages.

It is appropriate to forbid clients to pay for domestic equipment at above-list prices.
Prices for new and updated types of equipment must undergo expert appraisal by the
State Price Committee. He obviously need to restrict the influence construction or-
ganizations have on planners and clients at the design and agreement stage. Those
questions which must be agreed upon should no longer include overall layout resolu-
tions. building materials and components or site of start-up complexes. These ques-
tions must be resolved by the planner and client. and the planning resolutions adop-
ted need to be agreed to only by state architecture-construction supervisory agencies.

The decree of 12 July 1979 points out that penalties outlined by law or by contract

for failing to meet contract obligations must be imposed without reciprocal set-offs.
The procedure for imposing these penalties in construction is established by the USSR
Gosplan, jointly with the USSR Cosstroy. USSR Ministry of Pinance and USSR State Com-
mittee for Labor and Social Questions. In our opinion. the financing banks should be
entrusted with monitoring the imposition of penalties. Here this to be done. "mutual

forgiveness" between clients. contractors. planners. suppliers of materials and equip-
ment. and others would disappear.

In the area of the economic mechaniss. new estimated prices are called upon to ensure
a net cost of normally operating construction organizations and profit for branch ex-
panded reproduction in conformity with the planned volunes of construction-installa-
tion work and economic incentives funds with consideration of the fact that bonuses
for putting fixed assets into operation are included in the construction estimates.
Payments for credit must be taken into account at the level anticipated for putting
assets into operation under the schedules established by the plan. All additional

construction organization expenses caused by failure to follow the nor-native produc-
tion process. including pay-eat of higher interest in connection with delay in sect-
ing construction schedules. nust not be included in eatineted prices. In our opinion.
there is no need to increase the cost of construction and create an accumulation fund

for the expanded reproduction of other branches of the national econony by inflating
the cost of fixed assets in this branch.

Prices for construction-installation work should be developed as applicable to prices
for industrial output in accordance with the decree of 12 July 1979. that is, in
terns of both gross and net (noraative) output. But even the prices for gross out-
put must not include general overheads and planned accuaulations for the cost of na-
terials. of course. this will require the development of new norms for general over-
heads. planned accmuletions and other expenditure linits corresponding to the tech-
nical and organizational level of construction production.

we should obviously also review the "Provision on Awarding Bonuses for Putting Capa-
cities Into Operation" (of ll Septe-ber 1979) in the direction of increasing the in-
terest of all capital construction participants precisely in the start-up of capaci-
ties. end not in carrying out individual work stages. and we nust change the ways in
which bonus funds are used. The bonus fund can he forned using several factors (pro-
fitebility. reduction in work net cost. bonus suns anticipated for putting projects
into operation. and others), but it must be used only in connection with the start-up
of fixed assets and capacities within the time periods established by the plan. Start-
up bonuses could be paid on another basis than quarterly, but they would becme pur-
poseful and important to workers of construction organisations. clients and planners.
Such a bonus system would per-it acceleration of the schedules and operation of con-
struction start-up complexes. inprove their quality, and lower personnel turnover in
construction.

Foreword

The huge scale and rates of growth of construction in the Soviet Union are causing
a corresponding demand for building asteriels end for an increase in their production.

The USSR construction industry has a powerful building eaterials, products. and con-
ponents industry at its disposal. The Soviet Union occupies first place in the
world for the production of cement, concrete, glass and e masher of other materials
and products. The huge WILD. of building netsriels being used requires their
efficient and economical consumption since even a snail percentage of savings as a
result comprises substantial sues and makes it possible to erect additional indivi-
dual structures or whole complexes.

The efficient end economic consumption of building materials depends on knowledge of
'tha varieties of buildiu eateriele, their properties end conditions for use. Proper
storage and transportation does not play an unisportent role in econoeising materials.

Construction in the titer industry is characterised by the fractionation of construc-
tion projects often with snall amounts of work for a project. remoteness from con-
struction industry centers. the coeplsxity (end sonetimes ssesonel nature) of deliv-
eries of materials to projects, etc. The specific nature of construction requires
effectiveness in solving the problems of using this or that building Iateriel and
knowledge of the existing products list. the properties of naterials, the conditions
for use, transportation and storage.

That which is set forth above defined the contents of the textbook whose goals are

to describe the varieties of the primary building neteriels that are being extensively
used, their physical and mechanical properties, the conditions associated with this
for using then in structural components and also transportation end storage problem.

The textbook was conpiled in accordance with the program of the course "Building
eateriels" for special nid-level institutions of learning for specialty no 1217.

Introduction

The plans for the economic and social developnent of the USSR specify the implemen-
tation of a large program of construction work in the country. In order to build at
such a scale, which has no equal in any country in the world, it is necessary to
ensure a further conprehensive development of the building neterials industry—the
priaary production base for construction. This sector must substantially increase
the output of its products and. along with this. achieve considerable inprovements
in its structure by means of expanding the mass production of nut asterials. efficient
prefabricated eleaents. and light, econoaical. large size components and products

of superior quality that will provide an inprovanent in the level of industrialisa-
tion. a reduction in material consuption ard the cost of construction and also
durability, comfort and architectural expressiveness in buildings and structures.

Hen already began to use building materials in ancient times. Line, gypsu. stone

and brick were known to our reaote ancestors. Thus, srcheological excavations show

that people already obtained clay brick in the territory of the Soviet Union during

the fourth century. However, industrial production—the first brick nolding plants-
began in the 19th century. The intensive progress in construction during the last
century and especially durim recent decades was caused by the development and creation
of new building natarials, the purposes of which users completely satisfy the needs

of builders. Such materials make it possible to erect complete and intricate structures.

Progress in creating new building materials and the inprovsmsnt of existing ones
continues unabated. At the present tine builders have the most diverse building
materials at their disposal with a great variety of properties. This imposes the
obligation of using’ than properly and economically (meetiu the technological require-
ments of the building or structure and providing the durability required, and the
quickness of erection and mini-s1 cost that is necessary).

The goals of the building asterials course. in accordance with the progran with which
our textbook was drawn up. is the study of the varieties and properties of building
materials. aethods of deternining their properties. and also the conditions for
skillfully and sore efficiently using this or that eaterial in buildings and structures.

According to the tradition which has becone accepted on the basis of neny years of
experience in taking the course, the first chapter of the textbook is devoted to the
basic properties of building materials and the method for deternining than. Individual
properties that are inherent in this or that building material are cited in corres-
ponding sections. Knowledge of the basic properties of building uterials is neces-
sary for an objective and comparative evaluation when using than in buildings and

structures. Laboratory work and research can be planned and conducted on the basis
of this section.

Subsequent chapters contain. in the :generally accepted order. a description of the
varieties and properties of natural rock and ceraaic neterials, adhesive mineral

end uteriels derived fron then. buildim neteriele derived fron poly-ere. heet

end sound insulating, peint end vernieh. finish. glue. melted, end tinber uteriele
and motels.

Special attention is given in the textbook to the properties of building neteriels
end the conditions for their use. Problems in the technology of their production
ere touched upon very briefly end only when neceesery. The technology of building
neterielo is e epeciel subject which should be studied in e eeperete course.

program. when neceeeery thie sequence cen be chensed durin the course of study.
