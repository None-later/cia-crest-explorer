[Article by 3.0. Levshin]

[Text] Below are presented methods of reducing errors in the numerical analysis
of electronic circuits caused by a considerable difference in the parameters of

their components. For the sake of definiteness a system of linear equations is

considered which is formed according to the nodal potential method:

YD-I.

- _ (1)
where Y is the matrix of nodal conductances. U is the vector of nodal po-
tentials and J is the vector of discrepancies in nodal currents. System (1) is
solved by the LU expansion method [1]. But the majority of results are valid also
for other methods of forming and solving systems of equations describing an elec-
tronic circuit.

The step of the formation of the system of equations is important for solving
system (1). To demonstrate. let an element with high conductance, g . be included
betveen nodes r and m (for definiteness r < m ). Let us write the elements of
matrix Y connected to nodes r and m in the following manner:

yrr-yrr+‘: yum ‘UIlI—g l

where yrr' y , y": and y represent the respective sums of conductance:

If the word length is finite. then already in the formation of matrix Y errors
will originate, since during addition in (2) the equalization of the orders of the
addends takes place and the low-order bits f the lower of the addends are dropped.
With sufficiently high g , the value of y computed according to equation (lo)
will prove to equal zero. The error which giginates will begin to be felt i-:
performing the subsequent steps of the to expansion.

Calculations with double precision make it possible to avoid these difficulties,
but then calculation time and the memory required are increased. Let us consider
other methods of organizing computations which make it possible to reduce the in-
fluence of rounding errors.

\
Let us go from original system (1) to the system of equations: Y'ﬁ - J' , where
Y' - {yi'1 , i. j - l, ..., N} is the modified matrix of nodal conductance: and
J - {31 3 i - l, , N} is the modified vector of discrepancies in nodal cur-
rents. Each k-th row of matrix Y' equals the sum of the first 1: rows of matrix
Y , and each k-th element of vector 3' equals the sum of the first It elements
of vector J . Here and below N represents the total number of nodes, but with-
out taking into account the reference node.

Let the nest element, information on which will be entered in Y' and J‘ , be
connected between nodes r and n (r < m) and let it be described by conduc-
tance matrix 6 - {g , i, j - r, n} . The current through the leads equals
respectively 11' andJ j“ . Then g is entered in Y' in the following

manner: To terms y' and yin , th i I r, ..., m - l . are added respectively .
g and gm andwﬁh i-m. ...,II areaddedngl-g + and 32'

when one of the nodes for connection of the component is the reference node. the
same algorithm is employed but the number of the node (N + l) is specified for-
mally.

If the element is a passive two-terminal network, then for it g - 0 and g2 - 0
and these sums do not distort the respective y' and y' . P r active elements
the organization suggested for forming matrix f‘ also lsI an advantage in cases
when 81 and g2 are close to zero.

In matrix Y' formed by means of the above-described method the synetric ordering
of numbers is also eliminated. In this case, even with fairly high g1 , as
when adding to y' , y' N g , and the like, the e of LU _ ansi _ quations
of type (A) is ”$115133.“ ‘1'“ result of scaling y"It is y'Ex! + y¢ea and

an error does not originate.

With a full matrix the method suggested does not require added memory costs. the
number of multiplication operations does not change and the number of addition
operations is increased but slightly (only during formation). But matrix Y' ,
unlike Y , turns out to be heavily filled and asymmetric not only in terms of
values but also in terms of the points of distribution of non-zero elements. The
method can be recommended for calculating small circuits, when working with a full
matrix, as well as for quasi-block matrixes when processing matrixes of subcir-
cuits.

It is possible to reduce the errors discussed in the case when the sparseness of
the nodal conductance matrix is take into account. From equations (3) to (4)
it is obvious that the scaling of y is much more critical with respect to
rounding errors than the scaling of :T1 remaining factors, especially in cases
when there is a contribution from symmetric two-terminal networks with high con-
ductance.

For the purpose of taking into account all cases it is suggested that the algo-
rithms for preparing t raw data and the LU expansion be revised and that the
equation for scaling ym be modified:

v‘...- 9:: + §:.:‘ + 9:: + 412+ r (z) ‘
F (a) -= (if: + 32.") (it' + izr‘mzr' + a)
(5)

The meaning of the symbols and the starting premises for obtaining equation (5)
are the same as for (2) and (6). The following procedure is suggested for pre-
paring raw data for calculation:

1. An array of numbers of nodes for connecting symmetric two-terminal networks
is formed: HD(i, j) ; i - i, ..., H ; j - l. 2 ; H is the number of two-
terminal networks. Furthermore, MD(i, l) < HD(i, 2) and array MD is ordered
in terms of the increase in i -the first number of the pair.

2. Parallel branches are converted to an equivalent representation by a single
branch.

3. Array Nb(i) , i - 1, ..., N . is formed, in whose i-th cell is written the
number of branches of symmetric two-terminal networks connecting the i-th node of
the circuit with nodes whose numbers are greater than i .

Steps 1 to 3 are performed once before calculation of the circuit. The required
arrays of indicators of the position of non-zero elements are also formed prior
to calculation. Conductance matrix Y is formed by the traditional method.

The conductances of all elements with the exception of symmetric two-terminal
networks are entered in 1:.

A flowchart of the suggested LU expansion algorithm is presented in fig 1. S

and KD are counters of the rows of matrix MD and of the number of two-terminal
networks connected to each k—th node, respectively. The remaining symbols are
explained in the text. At each k-th step a check is made of whether the k-th node
is connected with other ncdes by means of a two-terminal network. If it is not
connnc:ed, then an criiuary 5:99 of the LU capansiun is p=r£01aed. uthcrwise

the contribution of each two-terminal network is taken into account in Lhe follow—
ing sequence: 1) a determin:tion is made of the value of g - the conductance of

the two-re al network-~and of r, m (r - k) . the pair of numbers of connection
nodes; 2) y is calenlated according to equation (5); 3) - . ard are

Among the advantages of the organization of computations suggested here must be
numbered a reduction in the number of rounding errors both in the formation of
matrix Y and in the performance of transformations on it. Numbered among its

disadvantages is the complication of the algorithm and the increase in the memory
required as compared with the traditional organization of an LU expansion.

[Text] A description is given of the results of studying a number of electronic
circuit analysis programs for Yes [Unified Series] computers. including the re-
sults of calculating the characteristics of various test circuits and the expendi-
ture of machine time in using each program. -

At the present time an entire series of programs for analyzing electronic circuits
has found extensive application and new programs oriented toward Yes computers
are being developed and put into service.

Characteristics reflected in descriptions of individual electronic circuit ana-
lysis programs and the information available in utilization instructions do not
make it possible to evaluate the quite important properties of these programs re-
lating to the effectiveness of their use for the purpose of analyzing various

types of electronic circuits. These include accuracy in simulation of the static
and dynamic characteristics of various circuits, expenditure of machine time,
efficiency, convenience of utilization and the reliability of programs' performance
and the like.

For the purpose of determining these properties both here at home and abroad, a
number of studies have been made which have included the solving of a definite
set of test problems making it possible to compare the characteristics of various
programs [1]. In [2] a comparison is made between the characteristics of the
domestic SPARS program and foreign programs. In this study the results are given
of an investigation of a number of domestic programs for the analysis and calcula-
tion of electronic circuits, oriented toward YeS computers: the A3095 and SPROS
programs [3, a] deveIoped at MAI [Moscow Aviation Institute imeni Scrgo Ordzhoni-
kidze], PAUMl [S] and PAUXZ developed at £15" [Moscow Institute of Electronic
Machine Building], SPARS developed at KPI [Kiev Polytechnicnl Institute] [6],

the ELAIS program [7] developed at MIPI [Moscow Engineering Phy its Tnstitute]
and the FARM program [8] developed at HVTU [Moscow Higher Technical School imeni
N.E. Bauman].

Of course, the accuracy of machine calculations of the static and dynamic charac-
teristics of electronic circuits depends both on the algorithms present in pro-
grams (methods of forming and solving equations for the loops of circuits ana-
lyzed) and their software implementation, and on the accuracy of modeling semi-
conductor and other components of circuits.
discussion of these questions, the first stage of investigation is devoted to
estimating the effectiveness of methods and algorithms present in programs. and
the second to estimating the influence of methods of modeling individual

components of electronic circuits on the accuracy of calculating their static
and dynamic characteristics.

Below are published results relating to the first and only partially to the second
stage of investigation. Therefore, the results presented here do not preter to
completeness in the evaluation of programs but are undoubtedly of definite inte-
rest.

The programs listed above were investigated by analyzing a group of test circuits
which are described below. however. in the program for investigating domestic
programs were also included tests making it possible to reveal the capabilities
of programs with respect to solving certain practical problems.

In the investigation it was also taken into account that the programs differ also
in the models of semiconductor components used in them. Some programs (Such as
the first variants of the AROPS. SPROS. PAUHl and FARM programs) have only one
model of a bipolar transistor--the PAES model. The PAUMZ program contains de—
scriptions of three varieties of models of a bipolar transistor: the Ebers-Holl
model, a transfer model and the PAES model. In recent times a transfer model of

a transistor has also been included in the AROPS and SPROS programs. The ELAIS
program includes a model, particular cases of which can be an ﬁbers-Noll model and
a transfer model. The SPARS program makes it possible to use any of the above-
listed models of semiconductor devices.

For the purpose of unifying test problems for various programs in making calcula-
tions of transistor circuits (presented below in figs 1, 2 and 5), the Eberseﬂoll
model present in the PAUH2 and ELAIS programs was used as the basis. and a model
used in foreign programs, with constant gain of the transistor. In analyzing the
same circuits by means of the AROPS, PARK, SPROS and PAUMl programs, the PAES
model was used with parameters corresponding to the ﬁbers-Moll model used. Ex-
amples were calculated by means of the SPARS program by using both the PAES model
(in the SPARS (P) columns in the tables presented), and the ﬁbers—Moll model with
constant gain (the data are presented in the SPARS (EM) columns).

The following numerical values of parameters of the Ebers-Moll_model are used:
. - 0.429-10 ‘0 mA. I - 0.578-10 ‘0 mA, 0 - ilmo - 38.3 v 1. tb = 21 pF.

In addition. let us note that the data on foreign programs presented in the tables
correspond to the case wncn :he transisrors have been suhstiruted by an ﬁbers-Moll

The analysis of the test circuits presented in figs 8. 9 and lO and of investiga-
tions belonging to the second stage was performed in two variants: by using.
respectively, the PASS model for transistors and a more precise mode1 available
in a number of programs-the transfer or Ebers-Holl. In this case 'i. goal was

Transistor circuits with sharply differing time constants and an inverter are
shown in fig 1 (circuits 1, 2 and 3). They make it possible to check the ability
of programs to increase their integration step (and at the same time to reduce
the expenditure of machine time) under the condition when the influence of the
loop with the lowest time constant becomes insignificant and vice-versa. The
results of analyzing these circuits are given in table 2.

Circuits 4 to 8, presented in fig 2, contain inverters, the number of which in
them varies (from one to nine). The results of analyzing three-, five- and nine-
stage inverter circuits (circuits 5. 6 and 8) are given in table 3. Dependences
of the expenditure of machine time for the analysis of transient processes in the
circuits in fig 2 as a function of the number of inverters in the circuit are
shown in fig 3.

The nature of the dependence of an increase in the expenditure of time for the
analysis of transient conditions as a function of the number of inverters in the
circuit characterizes the capabilities of the program. The more slowly the time
required for analysis increases, the more efficient the program and the lower the
cost of solving big problems on the computer.

RC circuits are presented in fig 4. Circuits 9, 10 and 11 have various time con-
stants for individual loops. Their analysis, together with an analysis of circuits
2 and 3, makes it possible to estimate the efficiency of programs from the view-
point of expenditures of machine time in solving similar problems. In addition,
circuits 12 and 13 are included here for estimating the accuracy of analyzing

transient processes. The results of analyzing RC circuits are presented in table

characteristic of such a filter Z32 in the form of a signal made up of two sine
curves, the amplitude of whose envelope diminishes over time, as is shown in

fig 6. The period of oscillations of the output voltage equals 6.28 s with a
duration of the analyzed process of 20,000 s.

the purpose of ensuring the required accuracy of determining the filter's output

The circuit presented in fig 9 is a shock-excited oscillator which produces steady
oscillations with a practically constant frequency beginning with the instant

of the establishment of input voltage. The parameters of the oscillator's circuit

circuit analyzed. The language of the PAUHZ program can be mentioned in this
regard. Since the PAUMZ program at the same time makes possible sufficient
accuracy in modeling circuits with relatively minor expenditures of machine time.
this makes it possible to recommend it for use in the development and study of
various circuits operating under various conditions, taking into account the
temperature of the environment and the effect of various external factors.

A very important property of a program is the existence in it of both simple and
more precise models of semiconductor components of circuits. This makes it
possible to select one model or another on the basis of the required accuracy

of obtaining characteristics. From this point of view the PAUMl and FARM pro-
grams, which contain a single (and simplified) model of a bipolar transistor--the
PAES model, undoubtedly have a serious disadvantage.

A great advantage of the AROPS and SPROS programs is their ability to optimize
circuits, a property by which many programs are not distinguished. Among the ad-
vantages of these programs must be mentioned the mildly sloping nature of the
curve reflecting the relationship between expenditures of machine time and the
number of elements in the circuit analyzed (fig 3), which indicates their great
abilities with regard to the analysis of large-scale electronic circuits. These
advantages in combination with a degree of accuracy sufficient for many problems
and relatively slight expenditures of machine time. as well as with the possibili-
ty of performing multivariant calculations and statistical analysis and optimiza-
tion, and the existence in the SPROS program of a macromodeling subsystem, make
it possible to recommend the AROPS and SPROS programs for use in work relating to
the circuitry design of electronic circuits [6].

Among the positive aspects of the SPARS program [6] must be mentioned the exist-
ence of a high-level input language, the ability by means of input language faci-
lities of on—line supplementing and correcting of a library of models of multi-
terminal components, and procedures for parametric optimization and static ana-
lysis. '

These factors, as well as sufficiently high accuracy in solving problems with
relatively slight expenditures of machine time, and the mildly sloping nature of
the curve characterizing the increase in computing costs with an increase in the
number of elements of circuits studied (fig 3), make it possible to conclude that
it is possible to utilize the SPARS program effectively for solving a broad range
of problems originating at the stage of the circuitry design of radio electronic
equipment.

The results obtained in analyzing various types of circuits by means of a number
of domestic programs are of interest to developers of programs and, in particular,
to users, since they make it possible to estimate possible degrees of precision
and required expenditures of machine time necessary for analyzing various kinds
of circuits and to select the most suitable program for solving specific problems.

In conclusion it must be mentioned that a comparative analysis of different pro-
grams is a rather difficult task. An investigation procedure has not been finally
established up to the present time. In subsequent studies special attention must
be paid to improving the investigation procedure with the goal of developing cri-
teria for estimating the accuracy of modeling and the effectiveness of using

programs for analyzing electronic circuits, which is necessary for a more objec-
tive evaluation of the quality of programs studied.

MICROPROCESSOR IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING EQUIPHENT

[Article by A.I. Petrenko and S.A. Bublikl

[Texr] A survey is given of basic approaches to designing digital signal pro-
cessing equipment utilizing microprocessor sets. It is demonstrated that the
choice of the structure of the signal processing algorithm is of essential im-
portance for the implementation of high-efficiency microcomputers. The need to
develop problem-oriented facilities for the automated design of equipment of this
class is substantiated. -

Successes in integrated electronics in the past decade have created the conditions
for qualitative changes in signal processing equipment with the extensive use of
digital methods [1-4]. At the present time the attention of developers of digital
equipment has been attracted by the appearance of new components in the form of
programmable large-scale integrated circuits called microprocessors [5-7]. They
are distinguished by doubtless advantages: low cost, high reliability and small
size and low power consumption. The changeover from equipment with "hard logic"
to programmable microprocessor systems makes it possible in certain cases to
shorten development time. to carry out its unification, to make improvement pos-
sible and to employ self-diagnosis.

Digital signal processing equipment is a promising area for the application of
microprocessors (HP's). However, all the same the relatively slow speed of re-
sponse of microprocessor components creates difficulties for their use in equip-
ment operating in real time.

in the present article. using as an example digital filters. which represent a
widespread type of equipment for the digital processing of signals. a number of
methods of constructing processing algorithms and hardware suitable for micro-
processor execution are discussed.

where {x } is the input signal. (y-} is the output signal and a and b

are coeffgcients. is usually called 2 linear digital filter (Is?) {I}.* It is
obvious from (1) that a digital filter essentially completes the transformation
of an input number sequence into an output whose parameters are assigned coeffi-
cients a and b . In the frequency region a digital filter is described by a
transfer function obtained by means of a z-transform of expression (1):

M x .
H(2)=Ea;2 ll +21%: .

id) 1-]

Digital filters are classified as recursive and nonrecursive. If coefficients

b do not equal zero (if only one), then such a filter is called recursive. In
this case previously computed values of the output signal are used for computing
subsequent ones. If all coefficients b equal zero. then the filter is called
nonrecursive. Each reading of the outpuf signal is computed on the basis of

M + 1 previous readings of the input:

M

ya = Zavxﬂ-l '
4-0

(2)

The transfer function. H(§) . of a nonrecursive filter takes the form of a poly-
nomial with degrees of z 1 . Both types of filters make it possible to produce
practitally any assigned characteristic. The choice of a recursive or nonrecur-
sivc isplementation is determined by the conditions of the specific application.

it is obvious from expressions (1) and (2) that arithmetic operations-~multipli-
cation. addition and subtraction-~are used for the purpose of computing values of
{ynF . Since real digital computing devices operate with numbers having a finite
precision of representation, the precision of computations of digital filters is
limited. The resulting error in the value of the output signal represents a com-
bination of three components, whose sources are quantization of the input signal,
quantization of the results of arithmetic operations and quantization of coeffi-
cients. At the present time there are many determinate and statistical methods
of estimating the influence of the effects of quantization on the characteristics
of filters [8, 9). In implementing digital filters with microprocessors having

a word length of S to 16 bits. it is necessary to estimate the permissible number
of bits with which the technical requirements for the digital filter are fulfilled.
The required accuracy of the representation of values of the input signal and of
the results of arithmetic operations (multiplication) is determined by the dyna-
nic range specified. and the accuracy of coefficients by the permissible error of

on fast Fourier transform. Walsh. etc., algorithms are usually executed with
narrowly specialized hardware [2] and are not discussed here.

the transfer function. However, an investigation of the effects of quantization
in digital filters is not separable from the specific structure of the computing

algorithm.

Generally the assigned transfer function, H(z) , can be represented by various
structural diagrams [10]. The familiar structures of second-order recursive
digital filters are presented in fig 1 for the purpose of illustration.

For the purpose of reducing sensitivity to quantization effects, high-order filters

are often executed in the form of a cascade or parallel connection of first- and
second-order elements:

Each structural diagram determines the organization of the computing process dif-
ferently and, consequently, its properties and characteristics. such as potential
parallelism, the required memory capacity, quantization noise, dynamic range, etc.

The implementation of the computing algorithm with microprocessor sets involves
the design of a microcomputer. It must have the following key functional blocks:
a microprocessor for executing arithmetic-logical operations and controlling the
data processing process in the microcomputer, a read-only memory (ROM) for storing
the filter's programs and its coefficients (constants). a random-access memory
(RAM) for storing values of the input and output signals and intermediate vari-
ables. an input/output interface for linking with peripherals, a timer (GT1) and

a power supply. In fig 2 is presented a simplified block diagram of a processor
for digital processing of analog signals executed on the basis of a microcomputer
and analog-digital and digital-analog converters.

For effective processing of the signal it is necessary to match the structure of
the computing algorithm with the architecture and parameters of the microcomputer.
An analysis of funcrioning algorithms construcred for various structural diagrams

of a digital filter makes it possible to identify three characteristic features
of them:

1. There is a set of different algorithms which are equivalent to the same trans-
fer function, H(z) , but which differ in sensitivity to the finite precision in
the representation of numbers, in the parallelism of computations. in the memory
capacity required, in the number of steps, etc.

2. The summing of products and the delay of a variable by one clock period are
the most typical operations of linear digital filtration algoiithms.

3. The number of input/output operations in digital filtration algorithms is
relatively low as compared with the number of arithmetic operations.

Consequently, especially high requirements must be imposed on the time for exe-
cution of the operations of multiplication, summation and the transfer of data
between the storage and arithmetic-logic units. For the purpose of taking into
'account the specifics of digital filtration algorithms it is necessary to select
a microprocessor which is optimal for a specific application. A comparative
evaluation of the suitability of microprocessors must be made from a combination
of technical and economic parameters [6]. In solving digital signal processing
problems the following must be numbered among the decisive parameters: the time
for the execution of instructions, characterizing the speed of the microprocessor;
the presence of instructions for executing key digital filtration operations (in-
cluding multiplication, addition, subtraction, shift, etc.); the number of inter-
nal registers (i.e., the capacity of the fast-access storage), determining the
computing capabilities of the MP; the capacity of the addressable storage, deter-
:ining the maximum amount of information which can be processed; the presence of
a channel for direct access to the storage; the capability of interruption, de-
termining the multichannel operating mode of the multiprocessor: the presence of
microprogram control, making possible adaptation of the instruction set and of
the structure of instructions to specifics of a specific algorithm; and the ex—
istence of facilities for microprocessor exchange for the purpose of implementing
a processing algorithm possessing internal parallelism.

In addition to the parameters named, of essential importance for the application
of microprocessors is the number (and presence) of large-scale integrated circuits

from the microprocessor set necessary for the implementation of a specific micro-
computer. the number of required power supplies and the power consumption, the

presence of facilities for the automation of processing and for debugging, and
the cost.

The structures and parameters of the microprocessors which are widespread at the
present time meet the above-enumerated requirements to an insufficient degree.
General-purpose microprocessors such as the 18080, MC6800, F8. 280 and K580 are
suited mainly for the logical processing of data. The execution of complicated
arithmetic operations and computations, such as multiplication. is accomplished
through software, on which much time is spent. For example. the software imple—
mentation of the operation of the multiplication of two eight-bit numbers with a
general-purpose microprocessor of the MC6800 type takes about 300 us [13]. The
processing of signals in real time requires, as a rule. less time than the exe-
cution of arithmetic operations.

There are several methods, and combinations of them, for increasing the efficiency
of processors for digital signal processing which are implemented with micropro~
cessor sets: the use of high-speed microprocessors designed on the basis of
modern technologies. such as TTL [transistor-transistor logic] with Schottky
diodes. integrated injection logic, emitter-coupled logic. etc.; the use of micro-
processors in which complicated arithmetic operations (including multiplication)
are performed by means of hardware; the multiprocessing of signal processing al—
gorithms and their implementation in multimicroprocessor systems; simplification
of product summation operations; and the development and use of special-purpose
microprocessors oriented toward speeding the execution of basic digital filtration
operations.

Developers of high-efficiency signal processing systems have traditionally strived
to use a high-speed element base. During the last decade of the development of
the microprocessor element base the mastery of new technologies has made it pos-
sible to increase its speed by more than an order of magnitude. At the present
time integrated technology has reached the level of ultralarge-scale integrated
circuits (ULSIC's) with minimum geometric dimensions of elements on the order of
one micron and a time delay in a gate on the order of a few nanoseconds. 1n the
opinion of specialists, these parameters are close to the limit for silicon tech-
:ology. it is anticipated that the development of new semiconductor technologies
will make it possible to create devices with subnanosecond speed. Experimental
models of gallium arsenide logical gates with a total delay of 33 ps have already
been produced [l1].

But the software execution of complicated arithmetic operations, as indicated
above. takes a great deal of time and can be used basically for solving simple
filtering problems.

An increase in the computing efficiency of general-purpose microcomputers of

30- to loo-fold and more is achieved by adding "mathematical chips"--nicropro-
cessor large—scale integrated circuits designed for performing mathematical opera-
tions of increased complexity. These LSIC's are programmable and nonprogrammable.
The former are essentially processor elements with their own instruction set.

The Am9Sll and I8087 models are described in [12], which perform the operations of
extracting the root. raising to a power. computing logarithmic and trigonometric
functions, etc. Nonprogrammable LSIC's are special-purpose devices and make

possible greater speed. In [12, 13], for example, a report is given on 8- and 26-
bit completely parallel multipliers which form a result in 55 and 200 ns. respec-
tively, and the 25-bit multiplier performs the multiplication of numbers with
double precision and is suited for use in high-order recursive filters.

For the purpose of implementing high-efficiency digital signal processing equipment
it is necessary, as mentioned above, to match carefully the structures of filtra-
tion algorithms with the architecture of computing facilities. The most universal
and effective approach is the parallel organization of equipment and processing
[14]. This approach is based on the employment of potential parallelism intrin-
sically characterisric of the structures of algorithms [10].

Obviously. in a filter computation of the output value, y , is performed in a
definite order. For the purpose of computing a signal innany node of the signal
graph of a digital filter it is generally necessary to know the values of some
other nodal signals, i.e., for each structure there is its own combination of
order relationships for the calculation of nodal signals which is determined total-
ly by the topology of transfers. For example, for the structure represented by
the graph in fig 1c the graph for the ordering of computations of nodal signals

is presented in fig 3a, where (q } represents the set of nodal signals which can
be computed simultaneously. It Ma es it possible to estimate the potential para-
iellism of the computing algorithm of the structure considered for all arithmetic
operations. Assuming the multiplication operation to be the longest and to be
deciding the total input of time, it is possible for the purpose of reducing this
input to reveal the possibilities of the parallel execution of the multiplication
of coefficients by nodal values. It is obvious from the graph in fig 3a that of
all 20 transfer branches only 5 implement transfers by means of the multiplication
operation (since the transfer coefficients of the other branches equal 1 1). This
makes it possible to construct a graph for the ordering of multiplication opera-
tions. Such a graph for the structure considered is presented in fig 3b. An ana-
lysis of it makes it possible to draw the conclusion that the simultaneous multi-
plication of variables can be performed for coefficients C and C , and also,
in the nex: time interval, for coefficients C and C . Consequently, in a
digital filter having a Gray-Harkel structure it is feasible to use two multi-
processors. This makes it possible to reduce the total time for multiplication
operations from tu - 5 time intervals (when using a single microprocessor) to

t - 3 . Thus, the value of t - 3 corresponds to the degree of parallelism
with respec: to the multiplication operation intrinsically characteristic of the
structure considered.

The potential parallelism relative to arithmetic operations for any computing
algorithm is determined similarly if a structural diagram corresponding to it
or an isomorphic signal graph is constructed.

in a number of cases the degree of parallelism of the algorithm can be addition-
ally increased on account of the use of the conveyer principle of processing-
another approach to the multiprocessing of processes [10, 15]. In this case

the individual phases of the total execution cycle relating to different time
intervals are executed simultaneously. The canonical structure of a digital
filter (fig lb) can thus be made totally parallel with respect to the multiplica-
tion operation on account of the addition of added unit delays to the direct

30

transfer branches. An obvious disadvantage of increasing speed by the use of
parallelism is the increase in the amount of equipment.

 

Figure 3.

The steady reduction in the cost of integrated Ron's in recent years has made it
possible for developers to increase considerably the carrying capacity of digital
filters on the basis of employing tabular algorithmic methods of computing sums
of products [2]. In this case the operation of the multiplication of a sequence
of variables by constant factors is implemented by the operations of the addition
and shift of codes of an auxiliary vector function, 9 , whose values are computed
beforehand and are stored in the storage.

Let us write difference equation (1) for an element of a second—order digital
filter in the form:

ya = auxin + 0110—! '2' nth-2 "‘ blyn—I — 5:11,.-3 ‘ (3)

Let all signals be limited to a level of 1 l, and for their representation let

2. Read out value of O for i - L .

3. Add 0 with contents of accumulator register.

4. $hift_contents of accumulator register to right by one bit (multiplication
by 2 ).

5. Repeat steps 2 to 6 for i - L - l, L - 2. ..., l .

6. Read out value of v .

7. Subtract value of so from contents of accumulator.

High-order digital filters can be constructed. as a rule, on the basis of the
cascade and parallel connection of first- and second-order elements.

A disadvantage of this approach is the exponential growth in storage volume with an
increase in the number of arguments of function u , and consequently in access
time. In addition, implementation is complicated considerably if the coefficients
change during the period of operation of the filter.

For increasing the efficiency of computations performed in digital filtering,
developers have more than once resorted to different variants of the integral
representation of the filter'a coefficients and variables. In [16, 17] efficiency
was increased on account of simplification of the multiplication operation in
designing transfer functions of the digital filter with coefficients equal to
small whole numbers (including i 1). Characteristic of this trend is complication
of the step of forming the transfer function (PF). since the approximation problem
is able not to have a solution with specific requirements and limitations.

The body of mathematics of the arithmetic of residue classes (modular arithmetic)
is used in other developments [18, 19]. It makes possible multiprocessing of
algorithms for the operations of multiplication, addition and subtraction and the
performance of computations with high efficiency and precision with multiprocessor
systems. The time for the execution of the multiplication operation for n-bit
numbers in this case is proportional approximately to n , and not to n2 as in
the traditional method.

A system of residue class arithmetic is constructed from a series of modules,
u - (ml. m2, ..., mL} , which are relatively prime. Any whole number

(14,. .. . . 11,) X (3,. . . . . L-,) = ((u,’)( 0,) mod ml. . . . . (u, X 0,) mod m,).

Since residue class arithmetic operates only with whole numbers and the coeffi-
cients of a digital filter generally cannot be whole numbers. then in the imple-
mentation of a digital filter it is necessary to perform scaling. The values of
coefficients a1 and b1 are represented as whole numbers [Sa 1 and [Sbil
and the output signal from each element must be divided by factor 5 before

being used in the next iteration. For each second-order element this operation
can be written in the form: '

Computations according to equations (5) and (6) can be executed sequentially on a
single eight-bit microprocessor or, according to (S). can be computed simultan-
eouslv on two independent microprocessors (fig lo), and equation (6) by means of
a modulo-(2" - 1) processor.

The difficulties which arise for developers in using residue class arithmetic for
the implementation of digital filtering are related primarily to ensuring effec-
tive scaling, especially for recursive digital filters, to determining the sign
of the result, etc.

In spite of all the advantages of the methods discussed for organizing the execu-
tion of key digital signal processing operations on general-purpose microcomputers,

the best agreement between the structure of algorithms and the structure of hard-
ware can be achieved when implementing them with special-purpose microprocessors.
Special-purpose microprocessors have smaller overall dimensions and lower cost and
high speed and reliability. They can operate individually or in conjunction with
general-purpose microprocessors. Successes in integrated technology and the in-
crease in the degree of integration in a semiconductor chip to 20,000 to 30,000
components has made it possible already today to develop single—chip special-
purpose microprocessors (more accurately, microcomputers) for digital signal
processing.

In this connection it is interesting to discuss the capabilities and some features
of one of the first microcomputers of this type, the I2920 [20]. This microcom-
puter can be programmed for digital processing of analog signals in real time for
the performance of filtering, modulation, deteccion and the like. It has been
executed according to the n-MOS technology on a single chip measuring 39.1 mm2

in area, on which are placed a microprocessor, a reprogrammable ROM (RROH). an
analog-digital and digital-analog converter (fig 5).

The I2920 microcomputer executes a special-purpose instruction set: addition,
subtraction, determination of absolute value, copying of data and several logic
operations. Any instruction is executed in 500 ns. The band of frequencies
which can be processed depends on the time for execution of the entire program
which. in turn, is determined by the number of instructions (the maximum number of
instructions in the program is 192 and the frequency band in this case equals

6.5 kHz).

High efficiency in the processing of numbers is made possible by the conveyer
architecture of the microcomputer and by an efficient algorithm for multiplying
numbers. In multiplying variables by constants a sequence of addition and sub-
traction of variables scaled by a power of two is employed. For example. if
variable y is multiplied by constant b (b - 1.7656_- 21.-_22 + 2 ) , then
the product may be written in the form: yb - y21 - y2 2 + y2 5 . Scaling is
performed in the range from 22 to 2'13 and is implemented by an appropriate
shift to the left or right. The multiplication method employed makes it possible
to reduce the time severalfold and requires a small amount of hardware. Arith-
metic operations are performed with 25-bit numbers, making possible high accuracy
of results. The 12920 microcomputer is fairly simple to program.

The resources of this micrcomputer are sufficient for solving many practical

problems. They make possible, for example, the software implementation of 20
pairs of two-terminal recursive filters or a spectrum analyzer for the sound

spectrum. '

However, for solving more complicated problems associated, for example. with the
processing of a flow of digital information from various sources, a digital signal
processing processor is usually executed in the form of a multichip configuration
formed from a central control unit and peripheral processing modules. The func-
tions of the control unit are usually performed by a general-purpose multipro-
cessor and the modules are essentially special-purpose processors which perform
individual complete processing procedures based on programs written in the ROM.
Able to serve as an example of hardware of this design is the THS 9900 system of
microprocessor modules for military purposes by Texas Instruments, Inc. [21].

It should be mentioned that the development and production of special-purpose
microprocessor sets and of microcomputers are feasible when they are used in
great volume. The choice of the variant of the structure of the processing al-
gorithm and of the hardware configuration depend on specific conditions of use.

Development of the computing algorithm is an important step in the complicated and
multistage process of designing microprocessor signal processing systems. De-
cisions made at this stage determine many technical and economic parameters of

the future microcomputer. As is obvious from the discussion above, it is not
separable from selection of the architecture of the microcomputer. Creation of
the software, whose cost represents a major portion of the cost of the system.
begins with development of the algorithm.

The complexity of the problems facing developers of microprocessor systems is
responsible for the necessity of the extensive application of design automation
equipment at all stages of development. However, the microprocessor design systems
used at the present time are mainly of a problem-invariant nature and are oriented
toward the development and debugging of software and hardware according to a
greyated algorithm [22]. In cases when algorithms are considerably complicated
and consequently have high a priori indefiniteness of their structure (as, for
exarpie, digital signal processing algorithms), it is necessary to supplement
these facilities with a problem-oriented part designed for the development of an
optizum algorithm. This makes it possible to determine its structure and para-
meters and to reveal errors before writing and debugging the program.

As an example i: is possible to refer to the packages of applied programs which
are included in the software of the Automated Design of Digital Systems (DISAP)
system [23]. The DISA?-A°PROKSIMATSIYA I-APPROXIMATION] PPP [package of applied
programs] makes it possible to solve problems relating to the approximation of the
frequency and time characteristics of digital recursive filters from the transfer
functions of analog prototype filters. The DISAP-ANALIZ [~ANALYSIS] FF? is de-
signed for multivariant frequency—time analysis of computing algorithms with a

library or random structure (up to 150 branches and 80 nodes) represented by
isomorphic signal graphs.

Text] Designing digital signal processing equipment (UTsOS) employing large-
scale integrated circuits (LSIC's) and microprocessors is a complicated, multi-
stage, iterative process. Considerable difficulty for developers resides in
finding the optimum hardware implementation of signal processing algorithms under
conditions of the not too high speed of response of elements and short word length
[1. 2}. High efficiency and quality in designing UTsOS, the functional complexity
of which is increasing steadily, can be achieved only on the basis of the overall
employment of facilities and methods of automating designing at all stages of de-
velopment-by the creation of special-purpose sarn UTsOS's [automated design sys-
tems for digital signal processing equipment].

The problems to be solved by developers and trends in the development of UTsOS
make it possible to formulate the basic rules and requirements for SAPR UTsOS's
as follows:

The direct developer of electronic equipment is the user of problem-oriented
SAPR UTsOS's.

Packages of applied programs for SAPR UTsOS's must make possible the solution of
a broad range of problems associated with the approximation and analysis 0! the
characteristics of digital equipment and its structural and parametric organiza-
tion and with the production of design documentation.

Interaction between the developer-user and an SAPR UTsOS is organized on the basis
of a problem-oriented input language the semantics of whose basic syntactical
constructions are based on concepts familiar to a developer of electronic equip-
ment. -

An SAPR UTsOS is a component of industrial integrated SAPR's [automated design
systems]; the organization of its software, hardware and data support is determined
by the general requirements for SAPR's for technical equipment and systems [3].

These principles formed the basis of the Automated Design System for Digital
Systems (DISAP) under development. The first version of the system consists of

two packages of applied programs: the DISAP-APPROKSIMATSIYA [-APPROXIMATION]
PPP [package of applied programs] and the DISAP-ANALIZ [-ANALYSIS] PPP.

The DISAP—APPROKSINATSIYA package of applied programs is designed for solving
problems of approximation of the frequency and time characteristics of digital
filters (Tsf‘s) based on analog prototype filters. This is accomplished by
digitization of a given analog transfer function (PF), H(s) , on the basis of

a single z-transform--an algebraic (bilinear or biquadratic) or adjusted—~or of
the method of invariance of the pulse characteristic [1]. The appropriate frequen-
cy transformation is performed in necessary instances. Taking into account the
extensive use of the algebraic transformation, a speedier algorithm was developed
for the package which utilizes the symmetry in the expansion of expressions by
which the coefficients of the numerator and denominator of the analog transfer
function are multiplied. In these transformations the transfer function is de-
composed into simple fractions by the method of undetermined multipliers. The
modified Hitchcock-Berstow method is used for finding the roots of polynomials,
making it possible on the basis of an optimization procedure to obtain the values
of roots through precise values of coefficients of trinomials.

The result of the package‘s work is the transfer function, H(z) . of a recursive
digital filter represented in the form of a cascade or parallel connection of
elements of the first and second order. Furthermore, its maximum order in a given
version of the system equals 20. The package's programs make it possible also to
calculate frequency and time characteristics, zeros and poles of the digital fil—
ter's transfer function.

A problem-oriented input language with free formats has been developed for the
purpose of organizing efficient interaction between the use: and the DISAP system.
Functionally it is divided into a language for describing the subject of study and
conversion and a language for describing the assignment for study and conversion.
The DlSAP-APPROKSIHATSIYA PP? input language represents a subset of the language of

a!

the v.9A? system.

The description of the original transfer function of the analog filter, “(3) .

in the input language of the DTSAP-APPROKSIMATSIYA package can be represented

bath on the basis of coefficients and by means of roots. The language for describ-
ing the assignment makes it possible to present the necessary procedures of the
computing process in terms familiar to a UTsOS development engineer.

The DISAP-ANALIZ package of applied programs is designed for solving a broad range
of problems originating in the development of structural diagrams of UTsOS, such
as digital filters. phase correctors, etc. The elements of the circuits under
study can be adders. multipliers and delay elements. For linear and parametric
digital circuits of random form the package's programs make it possible to per-
form nultivariant studies of characteristics in the frequency and time regions,

to model parametric sensitivity, to form circuit functions, to analyze stability;
to study the effects of the quantization of coefficients, the results of arithmetic
operations and values of the input signal; and to estimate the dynamic range, non-
linear distortion and the potential parallelism of structures. These studies can
be performed for steady-state and transient conditions. for conditions of constant

and variable factors and of constant and variable time intervals, in various com-
binations of them.

Equations for the mathematical model of a digital circuit can be obtained in
various ways. In the DISAP-ANALIZ version under consideration a mathematical
model of a digital circuit of random structure functioning with variable factors
and time intervals is formed on the basis of the method of nodal signals [6].

In matrix form it can be writt n for the t as region in the form of a system of
difference equations, y(n) - f (n)y(n) + fd(n)y(n-l) + x(n) , where y(n) is

the column vector of the values of N internal nodal signals, x(n) is the column
vector of N external signals, f (n) is the matrix of dimension N X N of
coefficients for the transfer of lements without delay, and f (n) is the matrix
of dimension N X N of coefficients for the transfer of elemengs with unit delay.

In the case of a linear circuit invariant in terms of shift, matrix elements

f and f do not depend on time. Then, using the z-transform, the mathematical
deel of a digital circuit for the frequency region and steady-state conditions
cantbe writt n in E e form of a system of linear algebraic equations: Y(z) -

. ch(z) + fd (2): + X(z) .

The advantages of these models are the simplicity of formation, solution and
modification. In addition, computations performed in keeping with the system of
difference equations are adequate for the number and kind of computations and
their sequence in a real unit of equipment, which makes possible the software
modeling of various effects, such as loops of instructions and overflow. The
effects of quantization associated with the truncation and rounding of numbers
can be determined precisely [5] or on the basis of a probabilistic model [6].

The description of the digital circuit to be studied and the assignment for its
study and conversion are entered into the computer in the problem-oriented input
language of the DISAP-ANALIZ PPP, which is a subset of the input language of the
DISAP system. At the data preparation stage the structural diagram of the UTsOS
is represented in the form of an isomorphic signal graph. The elements of the
circuit under study are replaced by branches of the graph, for which are indi-
cated the directions of the transfer of signals, connection nodes, identifiers of
the type of branch, transfer coefficients or a set of parameters, and the order
number of the branch. The package makes it possible to analyze digital circuits
whose equivalent circuits contain up to 150 branches and 80 nodes. The results
of calculations are read out in the form of tables and graphs for an alphanumeric
printer listing.

The DISAP-APPROKSIHATSIYA and DISAP-ANALIZ packages can operate both in combina-
tion and independently of one another. The DISAP system is constructed according
to the modular principle and has a multiphase structure, which makes it possible
to operate in the overlay mode with a limited memory. Program modules are written
in FORTRAN—IV and an assembly language. The first version of the system has been
implemented with Yes [Unified Series] computers under the control of a Yes DOS
[disk operating system]. For the purpose of enabling the exchange of information
between individual modules and the storage of the necessary information on magnetic
disks, a data bank has been organized which includes an archive of source data,

a library of input signals, a library of digital filter structures, libraries of
transfer functions of analog and digital filters. and files for storing inter-
mediate results.

Introduction

Rapid growth of optical instrument-making, along with the complication of instruments
and improvement of their quality characteristics, raise a critical problem of improv-
ing the technological effectiveness of their design and development of optimal pro-
cesses of manufacturing parts of optical instruments, their assembly, adjustment,
and control. these problems can be solved only by highly skilled specialists posses-
sing a profound theoretical knowledge and good practical training on the basis of
modern achievements of science and technology.

The production of optical instruments is characterised by high standards and the use
of special technological processes some of which are unique.

The problem of the quality of optical electronic instruments includes a large com-
plex of problems of designing and production whose solution depends greatly on con-
tinuous improvement of the technological effectiveness of the designs of instruments
and the use of new advanced technological processes. The quality of technological
processes in all stages of production of optical electronic instruments is determined
greatly by the sensitivity, accuracy, length, and reliability of their work. In
turn, the deve10pment of new advanced technological processes contributes to the de-
signing of better instruments with time-stable characteristics and makes it possible
to reduce their overall weight, dimensions and labor input into their manufacturing.
The above requirements presuppose the use of new materials for mechanical and opti-
cal parts, including titanium, beryllium, precious metals, special alloys and braids
of glass. Parts made of new materials are processed by special technological proces-
sea which differ from the processes of classical technology. They are: new methods
of obtaining rational blanks with the use of liquid self-hardening mixtures; machin-
ing complex framework parts with a highly productive equipment -- integrated sets of

machinery, machines with ChPD [numerical program control] of the "machining centers"-
type; the use of diamond tools for fine grinding. Methods of sizing with electron
and laser beams, ultrasound, and electrochemical treatment are used more and more
widely in the manufacturing of optical instruments. The production of parts with
aspheric surfaces made of artificially grown crystals, organic glass, etc, is grow-
ing.

Another distinctive characteristic of the manufacturing of optical electronic in-
struments is a large volume of adjustment and regulation jobs. The use of supersen-
sitive receivers of radiant energy in the sensitive elements of optical electronic
instruments makes it impossible to perform adjustment operations manually and re-
quires automation of data removal and movement. Control and adjustment benches for
checking modern optical electronic instruments are measuring complexes which are no
less complicated than the instruments themselves.

Electronic parts in optical electronic instruments of the last generation became
more complicated, which is connected with automatic processing and transmission of
information and with the fact that instruments became self-contained. This brought
about considerable changes in the manufacturing technology of radio elements and
electronic units, which led first to the unit method, and then to the functional-as-
sambly or modular method of designing and production. The method of modular design-
ing became possible after the development of advanced methods of printed-circuit
wiring. Hicromodular designing and further development of microminiaturization con-
nected with the use and improvement of fundamentally new and advanced technological
processes on the basis of integrated technology will make it possible to improve con-
siderably the quality and reliability of optical electronic instruments.

GENERALIZED FOURIER-HAAR CONVERSION ON A FINITE ABELIAN GNU?
[Abstract of article by Boyko, L. L.]

[Text] This article considers algorithms for fast or orthogonal conversions of

the fast Fourier and Hear types from the group theory point of view. The author
denonstrstes that the existence of fast algorithms is based on the availability

of an extended composite series in a finite abelian group of a non-prise order.

A broad class of orthogonal nonsynnetrical conversions, a generalized Fourier-
Haar conversion. is defined. Each of this class of conversions has a fast conpu-
tational algorithm, and the number of essential operations depends significantly
on the length of the conposite series of the group for the particular conversion.
Particular cases of the given class are the conventional discrete Fourier conver-
sion, welsh, Walsh-Adaner. and Halsh-Pailey conversions, number theory conversions,

the traditional Haar conversion, and the conversion by Hear k-functions. The
article has 20 bibliographic entries.

[Abstract of article by Negornov, V. 8., and Polyakov, V. c.]

[Text] The article raises the question of seeking for a smoother. in a certain
sense, parametric description (whose spectrum has minimum width) relative to a
closed curve assigned on a surface. It is demonstrated that the criteria of
spectrum width are related to its fourth-order moment and lead to the problems of
seeking the lowest proper value (minimum spectrum width) and corresponding func-
tion proper (optimal speed of movement along the curve) of the Shturm-Liuvill
operator with a periodic coefficient, which is the square of the curve as a func-
tion of arc length. Examples are given of optimizing the parametric representa-
tion and the authors briefly describe the possibilities of using this procedure.

[Text] The article presents experimental results of a computer synthesis of
movie-type holographic film. The object,two evenly colored spheres rotating at a
variable speed aroused an immobile third sphere, was modeled on the computer.

For visualization of the full cycle of the spheres b8 movie-type projections of
the object were synthesized on a surface, corresponding to 68 successive positions
of the object in space. Both the horizontal and the vertical parallaxas were
taken into account in transmitting the volume. The frequency of tracking the
angles of approach was variable. The film. which was a composite macro-cine-form
containing 1.152 elementary cine-forms. was secured to a circular metal frame

and illuminated with a laserlight with a spherical wave front. Hith an im-
mobile observer snd rotating film the illusion arises of smooth rotation by the
spheres, and the direction of rotation can be clearly tracked. The article has

DIGITAL MODEL 0? A COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL BASED ON A POWER TRANSMISSION LINE
[Abstract of article by Andronov, A. A.)

[Text] This article considers the set of questions involved in the work of a
high-frequency communications channel for a power transmission line. especially
the basic type of interference in the channel - interference of the corona dis-
charge of the wires. The author constructs a digital model of a high-frequency
communications channel for a power transmission line on the basis of the physical
mechanisa of formation of interference from the corona and experimental data on
its statistical characteristics. The article analyses the question of the ade-
quacy of a digital model and a high-frequency channel. It is shown that results
obtained on the digital model correspond to experimental data. The digital model
is used to obtain and analyse various statistical characteristics of the channel.
The article gives results from investigations which permit a deeper study of the
processes taking place in a high~frequency communications channel. The article
has five illustrations and 10 bibliographic entries.

DISPLAY PROCESSOR FOR DIALOG PROCESSING OF SEHITONE IMAGES
[Abstract of article by Bokshteyn, I. H.)

[Text] The article gives an analysis of the possibilities of constructing a dis-
play processor and the general requirements for its structure. The author re-
views in detail the primary block of the display processor, the arithmetic unit.
The article enumerates the basic operations which must be performed by the
"fast" and "slow" parts of this unit and discusses the possibilities of building
these blocks. A convenient method of building the device which insures high
speed and provides communication between the display processor and the central
computer is described. The author considers a device designed to control the
work of the display processor and presents certain possibilities for organizing
dialog (interaction) between the operator and the processor. The article has 10
illustrations and nine bibliographic entries.

SPECIALIZED HICROPROCESSORS THAI PERFORM FAST CONVERSIONS

[Abstract of article by Rakoshits, V. 8., Kozlov. A. V., Hozhsyev, I. A., and
Belyayev, A. A.]

[Text] This article analyzes diagrams of fast conversions and the architecture
for constructing specialized microprocessors that perform fast conversions. It
is shown that where the fast conversion is accomplished on a general-purpose
microprocessor there is a scheme of fast conversion that makes it possible to re-
duce the necessary main memory volume in half. During development of the spe-
cialized microprocessor the choice of its architecture depends significantly on
the problem to be solved by the microprocessor, especially where it is necessary
to search for one or several maximum values of spectrum coefficients. When micro-
processors are developed in the form of large integrated circuits, a circular
structure is preferable for the microprocessor. The article has seven illustra—
tions and 10 bibliographic entries.

[Text] Annotation

This monograph examines the basic circuits of a contactless electric drive of
stepped-up frequency which uses recently-developed three-phase static ferromag-
netic frequency multipliers with a rotating magnetic field as the power source.
Particular attention is given to systems in which the power of the frequency
multiplier is comparable to that of the electric motor. Elements of the theory
and design of such electric drives are explained, and results of experimental
investigations of systems which use doublets, triplers and cascaded converters
as multipliers are given.

A system with a magnetothyristor converter of direct current into 3-phase alterna-
ting current and an output transformer with a rotating magnetic field is described.

The book is intended for specialists involved in designing, planning and
operating contactless electric drives of stepped-up frequency. It may also
be useful for students in electromechanical and electric power specialties.

[Annotation, foreword and table of contents from book "Long-Distance Radio
Communication Transmitting Devices", by Semen Ezrovich Gorodetskiy,
Izdatel'stvo "Svyaz'", 15,000 copies, 176 pages]

[Excerpts] Annotation

Features of the design and construction of modern long-distance radio communication
transmitters are examined in detail. A methodology for measuring their parameters
is presented, and questions of designing and servicing long-distance radio
communication lines are explained.

The book is intended for communication technical training schools teaching
the specialty "radio communication and radio broadcasting".

Foreword

The achievements of science and technology have made it possible in the past
10 years to develop and organize serious productioa of automated exciters and
transmitters for long-distance radio communication.

In spite of the large number of texts and teaching aids on radio transmitters,
there is no book which gives the technical characteristics or design and circuitry
of new types of high-stability exciters and transmitters for long-distance

radio communication.

The present book attempts to fill this gap. The book also touches upon im-
proving the reliability of transmitting equipment, measuring its parameters,
and the technology of preventive maintenance and rehabilitation, and organizing
the servicing of long-distance radio communication.

The material in the book is selected and arranged so that transmitter design
principles common to all types is examined first, followed by electrical circuits

and designs.

[Text] Annotation

This book is devoted to measurements of electrical values during testing of
high-voltage equipment in short-circuited conditions. Examined are methods,
circuits and singularities of measuring large currents, high voltages, and electric-
arc power and energy in the steady-state, transient as well as pulse modes. Recom-
mendations are given for the calculation and application of instrumentation.

The present edition looks more closely at measuring short-circuiting transient
currents, as well as special measurements, including testing of current-limiting
equipment, than did the 1973 edition.

.The book is intended for engineers and scientific workers involved in testing
and investigating high-voltage equipment. It may also be useful for students
and graduate students .

[Annotation and table of contents from book "Noise Factor", by Anatoliy
Prokof'yevich Belousov and Yuriy Aronovich Kamenetskiy, Izdstel'stvo "Radio
1 svyaz'", 10,000 copies, 112 pages]

[Text] Annotation

Methods for practical calculation of the noise parameters of radio receivers and
elements with consideration of noise from passive objects (clouds, radomes, an-
tennas, feeder circuits, etc.) are presented systematically. Along with an
up-to-date presentation of the theory of noisy four terminal networks, a wave
description is also given which is most convenient for calculations allowing for
scattering parameters. Particular attention is given the minimization of the
noise factor. A number of problems often ignored by specialists are discussed,
e.g., the influence of matching on the noise factor, the difference between actual
and nominal noise factors, etc. The most important relationships used to cal-
culate noise parameters are given.

The book is intended for specialists involved in developing and operating radio
receivers. It may also be useful for students of higher educational institutions
in radio engineering specialities.

Pairs and Their Application", by Yuriy Romanovich Nosov and Aleksandr Sergeyavich
Sidorov, Izdatel'stvo "Radio 1 svyas'", 30,000 copies, 280 pages]

[Excerpts] Annotation

The operating principle, physical bases, arrangement and parameters of photon-
coupled pairs and optoelectronic integrated circuits are examined. Construction
and design features of circuits using photon-coupled pairs are explained. Tech-
nical characteristics of domestic photon-coupled pairs are cited, and 100 actual
circuits are examined which illustrate the possibility of the effective application
of photon-coupled pairs in many areas of technology.

The book is intended for a broad group of readers.
Foreword [Excerpts]

Photon-coupled pairs and optronic integrated microcircuit are concepts which

are becoming familiar to wider groups of specialists in the area of radioelec-
tronics with every passing year. The development of photon-coupled pair techniques
has entered the stage of industrial mass production. Photon-coupled pairs are
being used more and more in electronic equipment.

In connection with this, the authors of the present book consider it useful to

generalize theoretical design and experimental material on the physics, arrange-
ment, characteristics and application of photon-coupled pairs. General assumptions

are supported by specific data on domestically produced photon-coupled pairs,
and by circuits in which they are actually applied. Materials from domestic as

well as foreign developments in the area of photon-coupled pairs were used in
preparing the book.

Major engineering collectives without whose participation it would have been
impossible to write this book have contributed to the development of photon-
coupled pair technology.

[Text] Annotation

The electrophysical properties of bismuth and bismuth-based alloys, solid
solutions of lead chalcogenites (Pb1_xSnxTe, Pb re - Sb) and other complex narrow-
zone semiconductors are examined during various external effects over a broad
temperature interval. Effective methods are developed for calculating the
kinetic parameters of charged carriers in such substances. Singularities of

the anisotropy of transfer phenomena and the influence of crystal size in the
quasi-uniform case are studied.

This collection is intended for scientific workers, engineers, graduate school
instructors, graduate students and students in physical and technical areas.

[Excerpts] Annotation

The mechanism and kinetics of solid-phase interaction between different metals
and between metals and semiconductors are examined, as are processes of welding
and soldering in various technical installation operations in the production

of semiconductor devices. The basic regularities of contact micr0plastic defor-
mation of the subsurface layers of semiconductor and metal materials are given,
and methods are shown for localizing, intensifying and controlling deformation
with application to optimizing technological processes of solid-phase joining of
materials in electronic practice.

The book is intended for engineering-technical and scientific workers involved
in developing and producing semiconductor devices. It may also be useful for
students and teachers of technical higher institutes of learning.

foreword

The increasing rates at which semiconductor devices are being produced require
that the wiring process be automated. The labor involved in wiring operations
(creating internal interconnections by means of welding, soldering, etc.) is on
the average between 50 and 60 percent of all of the labor involved in fabricating
various types of devices. Furthermore, failures associated with wiring operations
comprise up to 70 percent of all instrunent malfunctions. Reducing the level

of connection failures and guaranteeing their quality would make it possible to
increase the cutput of good devices sharply and to eliminate a amber of labor-
intensive test and monitoring operations, which would reduce the overall labor
intensity of fabricating devices and would create the objective prerequisites for
automating assembly operations.

The creation of scientific foundations for solid-phase welding of different
materials, and the development and introduction in the electronic industry of new
methods for obtaining connections with stable quality and methods of controlling
and speeding up existing processes have allowed these to be used to the fullest
extent in producing new technical articles. The present book is devoted to
examining these matters.

The first section considers the physical foundations of the processes by which
unbreakable connections are formed in the production of semiconductor devices.
Although the literature contains works devoted to this question, it has become
necessary to systematize and analyze critically the experimental results in this
area because principally new results have recently been obtained which allow the
mechanism and kinetics of solid-phase interaction to be examined more fully,
particularly the physical essence of the activation stage in the formation of

a connection.

The treatment of the activation stage of interaction presented in Chapter 1 is
based on conceptions of the thermoactivated nature of the process in a field of
applied voltages. The approach does not require the obligatory presence of active
centers in the form of dislocations on the contact surface of the harder of the
materials to be joined, and allows a broader and physically better founded ex-
position of the fundamental criteria and principles for selecting optimal welding-
mode parameters in order to obtain a uniformly strong connection and to provide
minimum distortion of the initial physical and mechanical preperties of the
materials. Considerations of the role of the temperature-time factor and of point
defects in the mechanism and kinetics of solid-phase interaction develop the con-
ceptions of this matter which were developed earlier by H. Kb. Shorshorv and

Yu. L. Krasulin.

Existing conceptions about the kinetics of the formation of connections are
developed in Chapters 2 and 3 from analogous positions. In analyzing the kinetics
of the interaction of a traditional metal-semiconductor pair, the main accent in
Chapter 2 is on studying the basic regularities of the body interaction stage of
the materials, which has undeservedly been neglected even though it is actually
impossible to obtain a solid connection without this stage. Chapter 3 examines
the structural and kinetic regularities of contact microplastic deformation and
the formation of connections as applied to a metal-metal system, which also have
not yet been studied sufficiently.

Hatters which are new in principle and have practically not been touched upon

in the welding literature are presented in Chapters 2 and 4. These are devoted
to investigating the basic physical regularities of plastic deformation and
destruction of subsurface layers of semiconducting and metallic materials, and
to developing methods for localizing, intensifying and controlling the process
of contact microplastic deformation in order to optimise technological processes
of solid-phase connection of materials. Optimisation takes into consideration
the requirement for realizing two contradictory trends.

0n the one hand, in order to realize successfully all three stages of solid-phase
interaction and to form a solid connection, the kinetics of microplastic deformation
near the free surface of the solid body must be intensified as much as possible.
On the other hand, in order to reduce the depth and degree of damage of thin
subsurface layers by structural defects and internal residual stresses, which
have a significant effect on the electrophysical properties of semiconductor
devices, the microplastic deformation in them must be localized and limited as
much as possible. Chapter 4 presents practical recommendations for optimal modes
of solid-state connection of materials, and criteria for their selection. Active
methods are developed for monitoring the quality of connections directly in the
process of obtaining ohmic contacts by a number of kinetic parameters of the
process, and for programming the application of external load and carrying out
the welding process according to a special assigned cycle in order to step up the
setting kinetics.

High reliability of semiconductor devices is determined to a significant extent

by the sephistication of the technology used in different stages of creating

the device, as well as by the quality of the initial materials. In this connection,
the second sectiOn of the book is devoted to examining specific technological
processes and equipment for welding and soldering in the fabrication of semicon-
ductor instruments.
