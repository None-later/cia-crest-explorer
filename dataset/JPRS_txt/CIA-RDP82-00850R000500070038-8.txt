TRIBALISH, POLITICAL RBALISH DISCUSSED
Paris APRIQUE-ASIB in French 26 Apr-9 Hay 82 pp 16-17
[Article by B. Kalambay: "Tribalisn and Political Reality in Black Africa”]

[Text] "Independent" Africa is going through a crisis in the excessively
nationalistic [nationalitairs] consciousness whose roots are found in tribalism.

With all its ideological connotations, the term "tribalian" is often used to
explain the struggle between different factions for the highest office in the
land. Before approaching this subject, it is important to give a brief redef-
inition of the concept of tribe based on historical facts.

The concept of tribe bears the hallmark of Hsstern civilization and describes
a specific form of social organizatnMIandIndo-European policy. "The Indo-
European tribe designates the broadest type of social organization that
existed before the apparition of the city state. It included basic political
units on a small scale: the genes (gsvus) and the phrata amo the Greeks
and the gens and the curia among the Latins. Maurice Godelier emphasizes
that the essential thing here is to note that all these terms (except for
curia) belong both to the vocabulary of consanguinity and the vocabulary of
politics. which presumes a real or presumed internal relationship between
consanguinity and political organization. "In this sense. the concept of

tribe fits into Indo-Buropesn political and sgcial realities as a fact of
their experience, an element of observation."

it is not yet a "catchall" concept, as it would later become, particularly in

the mid 19th century, when anthropology. by a aleight-of-hand trick. became
a scientific discipline. Actually, an acrobatic discourse on the "Other"

(primitive) can in no way be called scientific. The 19th century, which is the
century of historical discontinuity for Black Africa (1885), would also be the
century of the prostitution of terms such as tribe, clan, ethnic group, and

so on. Anthropologists, including the ethnologists, administrators. mission-
aries and all other colonists trading in shoddy goods would use the terms of

tribe. clan, and so on. to designate historical configurations in Black
Africa.

This was the situation when Morgan undertook a study of the "tribal" social
organization in his book "Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Husan

IIHI(NWW(JAI.USE10NLY

Family" (Hashington. 1871). In it. Morgan shows that the social relationships
that dominated the organization of most primitive societies were those of con-
sanguinity. These relationships of consanguinity had an internal logic that
had to be sought in the detailed study of rules of marriage and the terminolo-
gies of consanguinity. rules and terms that generally seemed lacking in any
logic. in the eyes of Europeans confused by the systems of "classifying" con-
sanguinity found in Africa. Asia. Oceania and America. Morgan arrived at the
explanation that systems of consanguinity have a history and have followed one
another in a necessary order since man progressed from the animal state and'the
sexual promiscuity of the primitive hordes and that little by little, there
developed a ban on incest and marriage between increasingly broad categories
of persons related by blood. According to Morgan. the "human family" evolved
from the prinitive form of "group marriage." which has-now completely disap-
peared. to the monogamy of the European nuclear families.

After this highly debatable clarification. Morgan defines the tribe as a "com-
pletely organized society;" a form of social organization capable of reproduc-
ing itself. "It illustrates the condition of mankind which had emerged from
primitive bestiality but which had not yet reached the stage of civilization,
of the political 'society' of the state." Civilization makes its appearance
with the state. through the disintegration of the "gentle" society coming after
the appearance-and ucvelopment of private ownership of herds and the land,

and the illegal accumulation of this private wealth goes hand in hand with the

consolidation of the monogamous family.

After this historical review, it-is important to present in a few lines what

1 would call the dynamic of tribal policy in precolonial Black Africa. I
wished to clarify the concept of tribe. for inasmuch as it is of foreign ori-
gin. it naturally takes on a different nuance in Black Africa. which greatly

risks distorting our own realitiesIand invalidating our theoretical analyses
if there is not absolute precision or no precision at all.

Dynamic of Tribal Policy in Preoolonial Black Africa

In his book "Tribalism and the Single.Party in Black Africa," Lancine-Sylla
defines tribalism. on page 23, as "a given social milieu. a system of attrac-
tions and repulsion between the members or two or more groups making up that
social milieu.. The members of each of these groups claim to be linked by blood.
but they are much more linked by the idea they have of themselves with respect
to others. Consequently, tribalism is a group'mentality, a gregarious illusion
or a state of mind that determines the conduct of individuals belonging to the
same group and that rules their often aggressive relationships with the mem-
bers of similar groups. This group, which exists in opposition to others and
whose members believe to be linked by blood. is the tribe. whence the word
'tribnlism.‘ This suffix 'ism' denotes the idea or ideology that the members
of the group in question have of themselves. In precolonial Africa, tribalism
is confused with patriotism or nationalism."

It is in fact a question of'a system of social regulation. self-defense and
of maintaining the equilibrium of the group. Black Africa has known a variety
of societies which Morgan calls "basic social units." Some of them were made

up or multiple political units. while others were unified under a single
state, in other words, the state-which, according to Horgah, presumes the disin-
tegration of the "gentle" society.

In Black Africa, one finds the basic social or tribal units, which in the
state (kingdom) retain a certain autonomy. The situation of these political
units changed at the time of colonization. '

Colonial Tribalism and Its Consequences

Tribalism as a factor of divisions and.the exclusion of the "other" began with
foreign penetration. From the 7th to the 15th and 16th centuries, the Muslim
Arabs occupied certain parts of Africa before being replaced by the Europeans
in the 15th to 16th century. The expansion of Islam was particularly expressed
by the destruction of the great empires that were the Soninke Empire in Ghana,
the Mandingo Empire in Mali and the Songhai Empire of Raw Kaw in the case of
western Sudan. .

Host researchers recognize that by'this period-in history, human societies had
evolved as follows: families. lineages, clans, tribes, kingdoms and empires.
From that time on, looting and even the destruction of African kingdoms and
empires would lead to what the csac [Congo Study croupl‘ ca‘lls "retribaliza-
tion," or the blockage of the normal process of evolution toward the nation, in
which family, lineal, clan and tribal solidarities.became secondary. when, in
the 15th to 16th century, Europe renewed its relations with Africa, these con-
tacts first of all involved the-introduction of Christianity and the trading
of products (the minority of leaders with the monopoly over commercial rela-
tions procured guns in exchange for slaves). Like Islam, Christianity would
constitute just one more factor among the elements of division.

The history of the kingdom of Kongo is significant.‘ The alliance with the
Portuguese, renewed because of the need of_the Whites for Blacks and those of
the minority of leaders for imported products, would lead to the abolition and
even the destruction-reestabliehment of-the great empires, kingdoms and chief-
tainries and consequently, to the retribalization of the different populations.
The Berlin conference (1884-1885) confirmed the Balkaniration of Africa and the
end of sovereignty. In the face of this situation, family, lineal, clan and
tribal solidarities would be strengthened and constitute the means of prevent-
ing the physical disappearance of members of the family. Slavery and the man-
hunts that went with it had as their effect the destruction of order and of

the stability of African states or empires.. Furthermore, the policy of the
slavetraders, replaced by.that of-the colonialists, was based on alliances
with certain tribes or certain states against-others. This policy resulted in
the blocking of the advent of national consciousness, to the benefit of lineal,
clan and tribal solidarities.5

Patent facts of history show how the colonist played off the kings and regions
one against the_other, emphasizing first the virtues of one and the faults

of the "other." In observing the situation in colonial Algeria, Fanon writes
that "the White nan, unable to meet all demands. rid himself of the responsi-
bilities. I would call this process the racial distribution of culpability,"

3
F03¢HHHIIAL.USE(NVLY

he writes ("Peaux Noires. Masques Blanca." Editions du Seuil, 1952, page 103).
In Zaire, this process of the racial distribution of culpability developed as?
follows: In Hestern Kasai. the colonists would tell the people emigrating from
Eastern Kasai the following: "You are intelligent, you love work and you are
not like the Lulua, who do not want to work'and who prefer rebellion." The
result of this policy was massacres among the two brother peoples. In Katanga,
the same spectacle of horror took place between what the colonists called the
"authentic" Katangans (Conakat) and the Balubakat group.

With the coming of fictitious independence. we witness the emergence of a
singularly impoverished "thought." limited to last-minute tribal coordinates.
Those of the "state chiefs" that were imposed on the local populations by the
obscure powers organized their power around a tribal "clientele." The new
masters undertook to divide once again-the people once united by common suffer-
ing. The tribal solidarities that were thought to have been stifled by the
fight against colonialism regained unexpected strength. People were named to
posts of responsibility because of their tribal affiliations. Leaders sur-
rounded themselyes with a court made up of the family.closere1atives and a

few faithful allies chosen because of their degree of complacency.

Postcolonial Tribalism

Tribslism then became a mechanism for the redistribution of power and the ad-
vantages it confers. Within a single country, one can distinguish a category
of "others" to which those who hold power do not belong. '

The preconceived idea of ”otherness;" which during colonial times functioned
as a screen between the White settler and the Blacks, becomes the line of
division between those Blacks who replaced the colonist in power and those
from other regions who are excluded from the state machinery and the distribu-
tion of related‘privileges. However, it is important to note that tribal
feeling as used in Africa today has nothing to do with that deeper tribal
feeling which the individual had for his family or lineal group.

Tribal solidarity as exploited after independence had as its essential purpose
to strangle any form of unified.political organization against the new forms
of exploitation to which the masses would be condemned.

The Zairian case can serve as an example to illustrate our remarks. The cur-
rent regime, in power since 1965. has taken measures which. far from eradi-
caring narrow group interests (tribalism). only help to maintain them. This

is the case of the quota rule. among others, a rule that sets by region and
ethnic group the number of posts available in government jobs and higher educa-
tion. This is also the case of the spirit in keeping with which the provincial
governor must be from another province. The result of this practice is parti-
cularly sad. One often sees that when the governors leave their posts. they
leave their places of work in a pitiful state. Some take pleasure in even
taking light bulbs and switches from their residences with them. It is there-
fore futile to ask them to help in any way the regions that are their respon-

sibility and that are totally foreign to them.

[Text] Unt ll 1979, South Korea experienced spectacular economic development:

the GNP increased by an average of 10 percent a year from 1970 to 1980, and
some targets of the 1977-1981 Five-Year Plan were achieved in 2 years. That

country had thus become a genuine modern industrial power, making effective
use of its labor, and having a good supervisory staff. However, in 1979 and
particularly in 1980, Korea's growth slowed because of nunerous economic and
political difficulties. In 1980, for the first time, it had a negative rate
of economic growth: 5.7 percent. This situation did not continue, however,
because South Korea changed its policy, and the positive results of the re-
forms appeared in 1981. It is estimated that the rate of growth in the GNP
will be 7.1 percent in 1981. Moreover, inflation stabilized in 1981.

French-Korean trade relations have been characterized by major contracts.
However, indications are that the development of Korean industry will con-
Vince that country to handle the supervision of projects itself, and that the
major projects will gradually give way to individual sales of capital goods.
In order to develop a better understanding of Korea and of French opportun-
ities for trade with Korea, the French Center for Foreign Trade on 18 March
organised an information day in Paris led by Jean-thrc Bernard, comercial
counselor in the French anbassy in Seoul.

For our part, in order to provide information on Korea's economic relations
with Africa, we are presenting a previously unpublished survey to inform both
Africa and Europe about what Korea exports and obtains, and by what means, in
an increasing nunber of African countries, and to explain the features of
South Korean development.

All of South Korea‘s policy is motivated by two main considerations: to
counter everywhere the efforts of North Korea, and to develop exports at all
costs.

The Seoul government certainly could not ignore the African continent, and
over some 15 years of enterprising efforts it has built up a remarkable posi-
tion. It has developed interests which, though not yet substantial, neverthe-
less occupy a not insignificant place in Korea's policy, economy, and planning.

The South Korean Economy: Growth and Vitality

By way of introduction, it should be recalled that the country's economy has
shown astounding growth and vitality during the past 25 years. The following
are the main statistics.

In 1953, just prior to the war that devastated it, South Korea was in a state
of absolute poverty, which was even more disturbing since the southern part
of the peninsula is devoid of any significant natural wealth, and particu-
larly any energy resources.

With an area of 98,807 sq Inn, comparable to the Netherlands, Iceland, and
Portugal, South Korea today has a population of 38 million, or 384 per sq km,
making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world. The
growth rate is 1.6 percent. The urban population now totals 57.2 percent of
the total, with 42.8 percent still in the rural areas. The city of Seoul
alone has 8.5 million people, or 22.36 percent of the total population.

The working population is about 14.5 million, of whom 34.2 percent are in
agriculture, 21.3 percent in mining and industry, and 44.5 percent in ser-
vices and other activities relating to industry as well as in the tertiary
sector as a whole. One should also be aware that Korean emigration is signifi-
cant: 700,000 Koreans live in Japan, and 650.000 in the United States--this
figure will probably exceed a nillion at the end of the century.

The population is relatively yomg: 59 percent of Koreans are under 25. The
people are active, enterprising, and accustomed to hardship. Their exception-

al dynamism is in fact the only real resource of South Korea, a preeminently
humn resource.

Using 1953, the end of the war, as the zero index--the standard of living at
that time being comparable to that of Chad--Korea today (1981) has a GNP
estimated at 0.8. $61 billion ($1 - 710 won; Fr 1 - 120 won), or a per capital
annual income of $1,636. It was $532 in 1975, and so it has more than tripled

in 6 years. It will probably be $1,870 at the end of 1982 ($280 in China;
$11.0 m mu).l

In 1981, exports totaled $21 billion and imports $26.3 billion (more than
double the trade of the PRC).2 ‘l'his ecu-pares with exports worth $6 billion
in 1975 and $1 billion in 1970. The rate of growth of the economy was 7

percent in 1981, compared to 14.2 percent in 1976, 10.5 percent in 1977, and
11.6 pcrccnt in 1978.

Korea's main trading partners are the United States and Japan. In 1981, 26.5
percent of Korean exports went to the United States, and 16.4 percent to Japan.

In the same year, 26.3 percent of imports came from Japan, and 21.9 percent
from the United States.

In more general categories (1981), 31 percent of Korean exports went to Asian
countries (of this, 16.4 percent to Japan), 28.8 percent to North America (of
which 26.5 percent went to the United States), 16.2 percent to Europe, of which

MWLIBEONLY

12.8 percent went to the Commity countries (1.7 percent to France), 15.3 per-
cent to the Middle East, 3.2 percent to Iatin America, 2.8 percent, $580 mil-

lion, to Africa, and 1.7 percent to Oceania.

In 1981 there was a sipificant rate of increase in exports to the Latin

American countries, +643 percent; to Oceania, +27.5 percent; to Africa,
*26.9 percent; to the Middle East, +26.2 percent; to North America, +22.1
percent; to Asia, +15.6 percent; and to Europe, +8.9 percent (BBC, +2.6

percent).

These exports in 1981 included: textile products, 29.5 percent, $6.186 bil-
lion; metallurgical products, 11.2 percent, $2.363 billion; electronic pro-
ducts, 10.6 percent, $2.219 billion; naval construction, 6.7 percent, $1.404
billion; various metallurgical products, including machine tools, (6.7 percent,
$981 million; chemical products, 2.9 percent, $605 million; tires, 2.2 per-
cent, $459 million; sea products (fisheries), 2 percent, $828 million; and
plywood, 1.9 percent, $393 million.

There was significant progress in 1981 compared to 1980 in naval construc-
tion, +127.lo percent. Textile industry exports also increased by 23 .6 percent.

One noteworthy aspect of Korean exports was the construction yards, public
works, and buildings in the Middle East, Libya, and Nigeria, which in 1981
earned $3.5 billion in foreiyi currency.

The structure of the Korean economy is extremely concentrated, to the degree
that 61.2 percent of the exports in 1981 came from 50 major companies. The
principal exporters, in order of importance, are: Daewoo, which exported
$1.90!. billion in 1981; Hyundai, $1.722 billion; Samsung, $1.607 billion;
Kukje Corporation, $866 million; Hyosuns. $786 million; Ssangyong, $758 mil-
lion; Bando Sangsa, $622 million; Sunkyong, $585 million; Tongkook, $300
million; and Hanil Synthetic, $226 million.3 -

These are what in Korea is called the General Trading Companies--or chaebol
in Koreanugroups with diversified activities, like the Japanese zaibatsu but
with the important difference that the Korean chaebol does not include a bank
in the group. The banking system in Korea is very dependent on the state,
which virtually controls credit and exercises a strong state-control type of
role with respect to companies. The Korean economy can thus be defined as a
liberal economy closely confined by the state administration.

South Korean Presence in Africa

The following is a review of the various aspects of the South Korean presence
in the continent.

A) Political
Until 1975, South Korea's foreign policy toward Africa was based to some de-

gree on reaction to North Korea's initiatives. Seoul tried to counter
Pyongyang's broad efforts to penetrate the African states. Its efforts

MWLUSEONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

consisted mainly of developing policy explanations; specifically, demon-
strating that North Korea's nonalignment was false, and affirming South
Korea's views or. reunification.

The year 1975 marked a change in South Korean diplomacy toward Africa, a
policy which had previously been relatively passive. It took the form, on
the administrative level, of division of the Burr :e-Africa-Middle East Of-
fice of the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Seoul into three separate area re-
sponsibilities, one of then being Africa, which usually is headed by a high
French-speaking official.

In addition to the political aspect already cited, there was also an in-
creased awareness of the economic factors specific to Africa: the assurance

of a supply of raw materials from a continent richly endowed with them, and
the development of exports. Thus, Seoul gradually became knowledgeable about
Africa, exploring its markets and assigning it a growing importance.

Since 1977. Korea has been engaged in a public relations campaign which has
not lagged. Korean ministers have visited Black Africa, and may prminent
Africans have been received officially and given VIP treatment in Seoul.
Prominent examples include visits by Senegalese President Senghor in lhy
1979, the Equatorial Guinea foreign minister in 1980, and the foreign nin-
isters of Liberia, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and Niger in 1981.

Also, several Korean leaders have visited Africa. In November and December
1980, Foreign Affairs Minister Shinyong Lho was received in Gabon, Ivory
Coast, Cameroon, Senegal, Ghana, and Gambia.

In January 1981, Minister of Science and Technology Lee Chung-oh visited
Central Africa, Zaire, Equatorial Guinea, and Sierra Leone.

In April, Minister of Transportation Yoon Ja Joong was received in Liberia and
Nigeria. In by, Minister of Home Affairs Suh Chung “we visited Djibouti.

In November and December, No Tee woo, minister of state for national security
and foreign affairs, paid a visit to Nigeria and Upper Volta. In November,
Chun Myung Kae, minister of health and social affairs, went to Swaziland,
Botswana, Lesotho, lilawi, and Kenya.

South Korea currently has 32 embassies on the African continent, 30 of which
are in Black Africa.

In North Africa: Egypt (diplomatic relations at embassy level established
in December 1981), Libya (December 1980), Morocco (July 1962), and Tunisia
(March 1969).

In subsaharen Africa, South Korea is represented in the following countries
(in alphabetical order [according to the French spellingl): Botswana (April
1968), Cameroon (August 1961), Central Africa (September 1963). Comoros '

Note:

1. There are permanent resident South Korean ambassadors only in the follow-
ing countries: Cameroon, Central Africa, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Gabon,
Ghana, Upper Volta, Liberia, huritania, Nigeria, Uganda, and Senegal.

2. Only Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Kenya, Lesotho, Phlavi, lbrocco, and Swazi-
land recognize only the Republic of Korea, having refused to accept represen-
tatives from North Korea. The latter is, however, represented in 45 other
African countries.

Only one Black African ambassador is resident in Seoul, that of Gabon. Phat
of the other African ambassadors accredited in Korea reside in Tokyo or in
Washington.

B) Technical Assistance

Korea's technical assistance to Africa is still at a modest level. It is
based on a nunber of agreements with African states.

Technical cooperation agreemnts: Central African Republic, by 1973; Gabon,
July 1975; Djibouti, February 1979; Senegal, April 1979; Zaire, November
1981.

Economic and trade agreements: Niger, December 1969; Central African Repub-
lic, my 1973; Zaire, November 1973; Senegal, April 1975; Cameroon, December
1975 and August 1977; Chad, November 1977; Sierra Leone, my 1978; Upper
Volta, November 1978; Cameroon, Hay 1979; and Liberia, Hay 1981.

Fishing agreements were signed with Gambia in July 1976. Others are ready
[or signing with Mauritania and Morocco.

South Korea has also received a considerable number of trainees during the
period 1963 to 1981: 165 from 23 African countries. There are currently 24
in Korea for training who arrived during 1981: 6 from Ethiopia, 1 from
Liberia, 1 from Sierra Leone, 1 from Cameroon, 1 from Ghana, 9 from Nigeria,
1 from Phuritius, 1 from Senegal, 2 from Tanzania, and 1 from Phlavi. From
1963 to 1980, 29 Kenyans received training in Korea.

During the same period, 1963-1981, Korea sent 22 experts to seven black

African countries, in particular Cameroon, mainly for agriculture and fish-
cries.

South Korean invesements in Africa have also remained at a relatively modest
level. At the end of 1981, they totaled 11.8. $7,582,000--$6,965,000 in
Gabon, $563,000 in Nigeria, $69,000 in the Ivory Coast, and $25,000 in
Senegal.

Export credits to facilitate purchase of Korean products were larger. They

Korea's trade with Africa also ranks rather modestly, but is making steady
progress.

In 1980, the total of exports to the whole continent was $772.8 million, or
6.6 percent of total South Korean exports ($17.5 billion for the same year).
In 1976, this figure had been $208 million, or 2.6 percent of total exports;
in 1977 $291 million, (2.9 percent); in 1978 $315.6 million (2.5 percent);
and in 1979 $523.9 million (3.6 percent).

Exports to the countries of Black Africa alone were $657 million (2.6 per-

cent of the total) in 1980, but $580 million (2.8 percent) in 1981, or an
increase of 26.9 percent.

South Korean imports from Africa are considerably smaller. The trade balance
favors Korea. In 1976, these imports totaled $75.9 million (0.8 percent of
tatal imports); in 1977, $98.5 million (0.7 percent); in 1978, $63.6 million
(0.3 percent); in 1979, $116.2 million (1 percent); and in 1980, $171.5 mil-
lion (0.3 percent).

Korea's main partners in sub-Saharan Africa in 1980 were: Nigeria receiving
$126.5 million in South Korean exports (boats, electronic equipment), but
Korea importing only $1 million (leather); Liberia, $198.5 million of exports
(boats, tires) and $69.5 million of imports; then, in order of importance:
Kenya, $13.7 million in exports, $17.5 million in imports; the Ivory Coast,
$7.2 million in exports (textiles, vehicles), $2.25 million in imports

(cofiee, cocoa); Ethiopia (purchase of coffee); Tanzania (purchase of copper);
Angola, Gabon, Uganda, etc.

It can be seen that Korea's trade with sub-Saharan Africa has thus far been

mainly with English-speaking countries-~particular1y Nigeria, which is the
focus of attention of Korean businessmen.

lixports of South Korean products are facilitated by the important role played
by mm (Korean Trade Promotion Corporation). This public organization,

established in 1962, and analogous to the French Center for Foreign Trade, has
permanent representations throughout the world. In Africa, ram has offices

in Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, lbrocco, Nigeria, Senegal,
Swaziland, and Zaire.

It is worth mentioning the Korean construction companies (public works and
construction), which have achieved remarkable results in the past few years
in the Middle East ($12 billion in contracts in 1981; $3.5 billion in reentry
of foreign currency)--we mentioned this previously--and which now have estab-
lished themselves in Africa, obtaining nuserous contracts, specifically in
Libya and Nigeria.

--Libya: In 1981, there were 8,000 South Koreans5 working on or for construc-
tion yards mainly of the Daewoo group.5 This figure should double during 1982
because of the nunerous i rtant contracts signed. The main ones are as fol-
lows: Brak-Shwarif road, 117 million; Socna-Shwarif road, $119 million;
Ghadames airport, $62.5 million; a developent of 7,000 dwellings, $367
million; 2,500 schools in Tripolitania, $526.5 million; developent of lies
Lanuf port, $295 million; and the Hisurata steel complex, $130 million.

Contracts completed by South Korean companies in Libya total $109 million,

and those now underway $2.708 billion. Hayang Company obtained $250 million
in contracts in 1980. Its goal for 1981 is $850 million.

In Nigeria, Hayang Construction is building 260 apartments in Sokoto and a
hotel for $168 million. It has a total of $178 million in contracts thus far.
Daewoo Company has reportedly signed a major contract worth $1.4 billion.

The South Korean construction companies are also beginning to establish them-
selves in Kenya, Sudan, and lburitania. In buritania, Tai Han company has

obtained two contracts: one for $12,l35,000 for housing construction, and the
other very recently worth $3.1 million.

Tsehwa has contracted for $21,670,000 of work in Malawi, and Kyungnsm Company
for $10.5 million in Cameroon.

However, in spite of the remarkable performance of the Korean economy over the
past 20 years, it cannot be overlooked that since 1980 it has been encomrer-
ing serious difficulties whose causes are both structural and the result of

c ircums tances .

After the assassination of President Pak Chong-hui in Odtober 1919, the year
1980 witnessed serious political unrest, with riots in Kwangju and the re-
pression which followad. Since then, order has been reestablished, and the
new President of the Republic, Chum Doo bran, elected to the highest office

on 25 February 1980 and the representative of the army's aspirations, is firmly

maintaining it. It is true that 1980 was a bad year economically, with a

negative growth rate of -6.2 percent, and that 1981 did not live up to the
announced promises.

Certainly exports, at almost $21 billion, have reached a very high level, but
on the other hand the balance of payments has shown one of the largest deficits
ever recorded ($5.3 billion). The domestic market has shown a slight weaken-
ing. Thus, inflation has sloweduone of the rare positive indicators that

one can find: at the end of the year it is expected to be 12 percent, compared
to Illa-4" percent in 1980 and at the beginning of 1981. It is nevertheless true
that since 1980, and throughout 1981, the standard of living of salary workers
has declined. Public officials admit it. This decline in the purchasing

power of the majority of people is not likely to stimlate the domestic nrket
or case the concern about an economic crisis, which is already admitted. Un-

employment, though not high, is increasing and must be taken into consider-

- ation. According to official statistics, it has risen to 5.2 percent of the
active labor force (15 million).

In sumary, the climate of confidence necessary for a recovery has not been
established. Investment is more and more limited. Investmnt in factories
and equipment dropped 2.4 percent following the decline of 24.6 percent in
1980. The statistics show that, in general, investment (domestic fixed in-
vestment) declined by 12 percent in 1980 and 5.2 percent in l98l--or 17 per-
cent in 2 years. The difficult situation in the public. works and construc-
tion sector in Korea itself illustrates these difficulties. The difficulties
have an even greater impact since large sectors of Korean industry, whose
staffs are often insufficiently trained, are using outdated technology, re-
sulting in a sometimes questionable production quality.

Sixth major companies have announced that their annual reports will reveal ser-
ious deficits. It is true that the banks have received government instruc-

tions to limit the damage by granting moratorium on payment of interest due.
Nonetheless, the financial situation of most of them points to serious cash-
flow difficulties.

State currency reserves have decreased by 7.7 percent, and the foreign debt
has increased. An unofficial estimate puts the debt at $38 billion (57.8
percent of the GNP), which means a debt service rate of 17 percent, consider-
ably higher than official estimates, and makes unrealistic the government's
objective of bringing this rate down to 11 percent before the end of the

Fifth Plan 1982-1987. The rise in the dollar and in American interest

rates has significantly increased the burden of this debt, both for the public

and private sectors, and there is no reason to expect a marked improvement in
the near future.

Thus the Korean economy, though it is not really on the brink of a general
crisis, and though it is able to point to certain strong features (public
works in foreign markets, shipyards, and electronics industry), can in fact be
seen to be in a clear recession. This was recognized by the new deputy

prime minister for planning, Kin Joon Sung, when he said on 7 January 1982

that he "would try to bring the economy of the country out of the long tun-
nel of the recession in which it has found itself."

In reality, it is a crisis of growth. Korea, which in 25 years has passed
from the stage of poverty to become one of the developed countries, now faces
the problems which confront industrialized nations.

It is reasonable to believe that the extraordinary qualities of courage and
dynamism which the South Koreans have shown thus far will again be demon-
strated, and that the current crisis will ultimately be overcome.

Whatever the case, Korea's development in these past two decades is an ex-
ample for all developing countries. It shows that human qualities-ﬁn a
country lacking natural wealth, small in area, with severe climatic conditions,
and moreover with the need to make a considerable defense effort to face the

North Korean threat (37 percent of the budget, 6 percent of the GNP goes to
the army)--can prevail over the most difficult conditions.

Work, dot-:rnination, a sense of nationality and the general interest, and
respect for the administration are the real factors in development. This is
the lesson that South Korea's recent history offers to the world.

[Text] On 21 March. Angola and Italy signed the nest important oil contract
ever concluded between these two countries. It involves the exploration and
pumping of an offshore oilfield south of the oil-rich province of Cabinda.
Besides ACIP [Italian Petroleum Enterprise], which is the principal partner
with 50 percent of the foreign investment, the other companies involved are the
French company ELF [Gasoline and Lubricants Company of France] (25 percent),
the Portuguese company PETROGAL [expansion unknown] (10 percent), and the Yugo-
slav companies INANAFTAGAS and INANAFTAPLIN [expansions unknown] (7.5 percent
each). SONANGOL [National Angolan Fuel Conpany], which has the monopoly over
the concessions, will hold a 51-percent interest and the foreign companies 49
percent.

The Angolan offshore oilfield, south of Cabinda, has been divided into 13 sec—
tors, and 6 of them have already been allocated. Negotiations for the alloca-
tion of two additional sectors are underway with the companies BRASPBTRD [Bra—
zilian Petroleum Corporation] (Brazil) and PBTROFINA (Belgium) for Sector b

and with the IEDC (International Energy Development Corporation-—Canada, Sweden,
Kuwait) and Hispanoil [Spanish Oil Company] for Sector 7.

A61? already holds a 15-percent interest in Sector 3, where the principal oper-
ator is the French company ELF, which has made two discoveries described as
"very important." Angola's major oil partner continues to be the U.S. company
Gulf, which operates in Cabinds. In Sector 1, initial operations consisting
of seismic studies will get underway in April or Hay. The first drilling will
he completed by December 1982.

ACIP is part of the BN1 [National Hydrocarbons Agency] group, which also is in-
volved in other activities in Angola, namely, vocational training (in ﬁgure
petroleun school, in a middle-level petroleum institute, technical assistance
to SONANGOL, and the training of mechanics and electricians) and agriculture

in the provinces of Benguela (west-central) and Mocamedes (southwest).

Economic and financial cooperation between BN1 and Angola likewise is evident
In the spheres of shipping and fishing. The Olivetti and Fiat colpanies also-

have subsidiaries in the country.

Paris IARCHBS TROPICAUX ET PEDITBRRANBBNS in French No 1901, 16 Apr 82 p 1006

[Text] By virtue of its geographical location and economy, lhlanje Province
has always been one of Angola's main farming regions for a nunber of crops--
cotton, oleaginous seeds, tubers, fresh fruit and vegetables. That province
has been chosen by the authorities in Luanda to carry out a pilot project
on "direct marketing."

Halanje Province has three different agricultural sectors.

1. The state sector, which consists of seven state agricultural companies
and two state livestock companies. The output of that sector was 3,282 tons
in 1979, around 2,000 tons more in 1980 and 9,700 tons in 1981, despite the
drought. Last year, poultry farming produced close to 130,000 young chickens
and 8,000 eggs (these figures represent the output sold to the population).
Hog raising, which was destroyed during the war, is now being rebuilt (two
facilities have been rebuilt and the province has aromd 600 breeding hogs)
so as to be able to supply the population later on.

2. The associated sector consists of 29 cooperatives with 3,353 cooperative
members and 110 associations with ll,500 members. To improve the assistance
provided for that sector, five priority zones have been created. Pilot
projects entailing new form of organization and new working methods are
being carried out in these zones (Quizenga, Lombe-Cota. Lutau, Baixa de
Cassange and Songo). In each case, preferential treatment is given to dif-
ferent crops (cotton, corn, sweet potatoes, tobacco, rice, cassava and so on).
It must be noted that the use of fertilizers has been introduced to improve
the yields. Last year's rice crop was 2,000 tons and the corn crop was

4,818 tons (following yields of 1,205 tons in 1979 and 1,973 tons in 1980).

3. The individual sector produced an overall output of 6,347 tons in 1979,
5,917 tons in 1980 and around 10,000 tons in 1981.

But producing is not enough. One still has to sell. The problem of marketing
their product was one of the main difficulties encountered by farming circles
in the first years after independence. To solve that problem in the Phlanje
Province, the goverment decided to establish a two-tier marketing system
with central markets and local markets in charge of direct marketing

operations within the framework of an agency, the Provincial Marketing Com-
mission, which supervises and coordinates col-nercial operations with the

farmers.

Today, there are rural markets all over the province and last year they made
it possible to sell 20,000 tons of farming goods. These markets are also
where rural families purchase the industrial goods they need to improve their
living conditions. Therefore, they counteract the impact of traditional
merchants who are often considered to be "exploiters."

After going through a period of "teething troubles," the direct marketing sys-
tem is now fully accepted by the population.

The outlook for the 1981-1982 farming year is thus somewhat optimistic. In
the state sector, however, some figures have had to be readjusted in view of
the economic situation. For instance, 2,000 hectares of rice were due to
be planted but, in fact, only 1,600 were planted due to delays in the de-
livery of seeds and the shortage of fuel for tractors as a result of the at-
tack on the refinery of PBTBANGOL [Angolan Petrolsul Company]. Also, they
still had not started planting potatoes and sunflowers at the beginning of
February.

In the associated sector, 4,000 hectares are scheduled to be planted; more
corn acreage will be planted than in previous years and the area planted
with soya will also be greater. But farmers will have to combat an insect
that attacks the leaves of the cassava plant causing terrible deluge.

Cattle raising will be given a boost by sending to the province 2,000 cows
imported from Botswana that will go to a farm of the balanje Livestock
Enterprise.

There are also plans to raise a hardy breed of egg layers and table chickens.
These birds will eventually be distributed throughout the farming areas,
since this hardy breed does not require specific feeding as dc battery
chickens. '

reinforcing the ties between the govern-ants of Lisbon and Luanda. The balance
of trade between Angola and Portugal currently shows a large surplus in favor
of the letter country-—Angola's major supplier in the Heat, ahead of France-
and Luanda wants to correct this ilbalance by increasing its sales of crude

oil [to Portugal] and diversifying its own sources of supplies. This plan has
been the subject of an intensive study. First, it was thought that Portuguese
purchases of Angolan crude “would not start for a while," on the strength of
reports indicating that Angola's order-book for 1982 was filled, and that this
latter would only be considered in 1983, depending on the anount of oil pumped.
But subsequently. Lopo do Naacinento, Angola's sinister for trade and planning,
announced that deliveries of Angolan oil to Portugal will start this coming
Seprelber, on account-of an increase in production scheduled to start at that
time. Portugal will then appear on the list of preferential buyers, which cur-
rently includes the United States. France, Spain, and Brazil. [Excerpts]

COOPERATION "1TH PORTUGAL--"Portugal's membership in the BBC will result in
greater cooperation between Portugal and Portugueseuspeaking countries in
Africa," stated Mario Scares, secretary general of the Socialist Party, on 22
March. Returning from a 4-day visit to Cape Verde, the socialist leader under-
scored the need for close cooperation between Portugal and its former colony,

a move which, according to him, is not in contradiction with Portugal's member-
ship in the BBC. "The lack of natural resources is the major obstacle to the
development of Cape Verde, which nonetheless has extraordinary assets: the
high intellectual and professional level of the leaders of the PAICV (African
Independence Party of Cape Verde)," Mario Scares said. The Portuguese deputy
prime minister. Diego Preitas do Amaral, announced on 16 March that in a few
months’ time Portugal will strengthen its military cooperation with Portuguese-
speaking countries in Africa. The deputy prime minister. who is also minister
of defense, specified that the program of military cooperation with former Por-
tuguese colonies in Africa "is in a way starting to materialize as far as Hozam~
bique is concerned," and that Guinea Bissao "has already made us some proposals
on that subject." Preitas do Amaral said that this cooperation, currently tak-
ing place under the auspices of the Armed Forces General Staff, will eventually
fall within the province of the Ministry of Defense. The deputy prime minister,
who received the defense minister of Cape Verde, Bonsrio Chantre, also made a
point of underlining his government's keen interest in military cooperation
with the government in Praia. [Text] [Paris MARCBBS TROPICAUX ET MEDITERRA-

[Text] In response to an article by our contributor Jacques Latreaoliere which
appeared in HARCBBS TROPICAUX ET HEDITBRRANBENS on 5 March under the heading
"Jerry Rawlings' Choice," we have received a letter free Joseph Quao Cleland,
the Ghanaian ambassador in Paris, which we are happy to reprint:

"The gift brought to Ghana by a Libyan delegation on 10 January 1982 as a token
of solidarity with our country consisted only of food and drugs. The food was
distributed as rations along soldiers. while the drugs were divided among sev-
eral hospitals in Ghana. Any suggestion to the contrary is unfortunate and
biased.

"Reports that Addae Anoaka, a prominent figure in the now-banned National Peo-
ple's Party, has been executed are untrue and without basis. As a aatter of
fact. Addae Amoako is now living in tendon as a refugee. A few weeks ago he
was actually interviewed by the BBC, and therefore he could not have been exe-
cuted.

"I must also point out that it is the acknowledged policy of the PNDC [Provi-
sional National Defense Council] not to execute anybody for political reasons.
The new government is in favor of holding fair and public trials and is very
scrupulous in the observance of basic hunan rights. You night be interested to
know that 16 military nen-b soldiers and 12 of other ranks-were killed on the
night of 31 December. Later, these men were buried with full ailitary honors.

"To suggest that the ailitary coup d'etat of 31 December which brought Air Force
Lieutenant Rawlings back to power was instigated by sole specific ethnic group
is outrageous and misleading. It amounts to a scheme hatched by enenies of
Ghana to sow discord and disunity in our determined effort to achieve a better
society based on responsibility and justice."

We take full note of the points nade by the ambassador and are particularly
pleased to hear that Addae Anoako was not executed and is currently living in
London. On the other hand. we recall that our contributor had questioned the
possibility that the coup had been instigated by "a special ethnic group."
When he mentioned that theory. he actually said it nothing but "a cock-and-bull
story."

[Text] In 1981, conercial exchanges betveen France and Ghana registered a
sharp increase in the trade imbalance to the disadvantage of Ghana.

According to French statistics, the deficit junped by 238 percent compared to
the previous year, from 14.6 nillion to 69.6 million francs, whereas between

1979 and 1980 it had increased only 26.7 percent—from 11.7 Iillion to 16.6
million francs.

0n the French side. the situation is due to a decline in purchases of cocoa and
an increase in sales of food products, lastly sugar.

[Dispatch from John Borrell: "Mozambique Resistance 'Is Hell Armed and
chml

[Text] Harare. Zimbabwe--‘lhe Hozaabique National Resistance, which is
engaged in an increasingly bitter struggle against President Hachel's
Frelino government appears to be better armed and supplied than official
reports suggest.

According to Mr John Burlison, the British zoologist released this week after
5 months as a prisoner of the mm. the guerrillas are well armed and fed,
and can move with comparative ease over large areas of central Mozalbique.

Mr Burlison, aged 28, said yesterday, that he had counted about 1,000
guerrillas at camps where he had been held prisoner. All were armed with
Soviet-made AK.“ assault rifles, and mortars. Landmines and machine guns
were in evidence. Several times the guerrillas returned to camp with
weapons captured in engagements with Hoaaﬂﬁcan troops. Prisoners had also
been brought back.

At the base camp where he spent most of the 5 months there were thatched
huts and the guerrillas did not seem unduly concerned about the possibility
of attacks by government forces. Food was supplied by local villagers and,
although he could not establish whether they did so willingly. or under
duress. Mr Burlison said the maize meal. vegetables and neat were plentiful.

"We ate three meals a day and beef or goat meat was served almost every
evening," he said. "I actually put on weight in the cups."

He said the guerrillas moved about freely during daylight. and on one
occasion he was accompanied by 300 men on a march between two camps.

Discipline and organisation in the camps was good, although he was once told
of prisoners being shot for trying to escape. "I heard the shots but didn't
actually see anything myself."

Hr Burlison said he saw nothing to connect the guerrilla novel-ant with South
Africa or any other outside power. A few old parachutes were in evidence
in one of the camps. But there were no nrkings on than.

The HEN is generally thought to be hacked by South Africa. Documents captured
recently by Mozambican troops reinforced Haputo's clains that Pretoria is
involved.

However, Mr Burlison's observations while a prisoner do not tally with the
official line from Maputo that the novelnnt has a rag-tag any, which is
continually being routed by governmnt forces.

Hr Burlison who was abducted in the Corongosa ga-e reserve, where he worked,
on 17 December, estimates that he was marched a total of 500 miles during
his tine with the guerrillas.

He said he had been well-treated and had even been provided with anti-malaria
pills on a regular basis. When a sore went septic on a march he was given
an injection of penicillin.

The zoologist flies back to Britain today and plans to visit his fanily
in Stokton-on-Tees.

[Article by Pierre Haski: "South Africa: Apartheid in the Pace of Resistance"!

[Tcxtl Every year on 16 Deceuber, the gap separating the Hhites from the Blacks
in South Africa grows wider than ever. On that day, each community celebrates
in its own fashion a page in the tormented history of the country: the battle
0! Blood River, which, in 1838 in northern Natal Province, saw the defeat of

the Zulus. led by their Chief Dingaan, by the Boers Voortreklters of Andries
Pretorius.

For the Afrikanders, descendents of the Boers, that day, called the "Day of the
Covenant," celebrates the "neeting with God." who alone made the victory over
the Zulus possible. Pretorius had sworn to dedicate the day to the glory of
and if he won the victory. “is descendents still honor his vow. Every year.
the Afrikanders go en nasse to the battlefield where a nenorial has been
erected. along with a massive nonunent built to the glory of the Boers pioneers,
the Voortrekker Monunent, not far fron Pretoria. For the occasion, the little
white girls are dressed in costumes of the last century. with ribbons and long
lrocks. under the stern watch of the life-size statues of the Boer warriors.

A large fresco inside retells the Boer epic, with battle scenes that depict

the Zulus. hate on their faces, chasing Hhite women and children with spears.

A few kiloseters away from the nonunent, a totally different atnoaphere reigns.
In Soweto. the vast Black ghetto of 1.5 nillion inhabitants in southwestern
Johannesburg, it is not the Day of the Covenant, but Dingaan Day that is cele-
brated. Thousands of Africans gather together every year in the big Catholic
Regina Hundi church in Soweto to swear to "continue the fight" against White
thmﬂnatlon and, in a sense, avenge the nenory of the great Dingaan. At every
gathering. nany Black churchmen, such as Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu. secre-
tnry general of the South African Council of Churches (SACC). and a few White
prIEHta also, come to express their support.

Now. lab years after Blood River, South Africa is far fron having found its

stability. 0n the contrary, it remains an explosive country, whose upheavals
are felt throughout the entire South African subcontinent and far beyond.

Apartheid: Scientific Racism

The facts are well-known: With a total population of over 28 million inhabi-
tants, South Africa remains under the exclusive domination of the 4.5 million
Whites. Some 2.5 million Coloreds, 800,000 Indians and 20 million Africans
remain second-class citizens in their own country.

The "epidermic" racism of the English. who governed the South African Union
from the time of its creation in 1910 (end of the Boer War) until 1948, was
followed by the "scientific" discrimination of the Afrikanders. On that date,
in fact, the Afrikanders. who represent some 60 percent of the Whites, overcame
their divisions and barely won a victory in the legislative elections - re-
served for the Whites. General Smuts, prime minister and hero of the fight
against the Nazis. was beaten by those he had had to intern during the war for
sympathies toward the Axis! Among them was a future prime minister, Balthazar
John Vorater. One then witnessed the birth of apartheid; whose very name
implies the notion of separation. The Afrikandera in power would try to separ-
ate everything. >To each his own, but with the Whites at the top! It was
racism, but also the establishment of an overall, planned system for the ex-
ploitation of an abundant labor force.

The ideological foundations of apartheid are simple. The doctrine is based on
an absolute belief in the superiority of the White race, accompanied by a reli-

gious conviction according to which the_Afrikanders make up a "chosen people"
responsible for leading this part of the Black continent. Whence the insis—

tence on the necessary preservation of the "identity" of the Afrikanders and
the determination not to "mix," not with the English-speaking Whites any more
than with the Blacks. Despite the anti-Semitism in which the Afrikanders
were bathed after the war, one finds in many of their writings comparisons

with the place of Israel in th Arab world.

The biblical justifications of the supporters of apartheid are numerous and
Ilnd fierce defenders in the three reformed Dutch churches that have pushed
their conviction about White superiority and the need to separate men to the
point of setting up different churches for each population group. The National
Socialism that fascinated the Afrikanders during the 1930's and 19b0'a was

followed by the "national Christianity" of the government emerging from the
1948 elections. Only the reformed Dutch churches, however, give their support

and backing to the regime. The other christian churches, on the contrary,
have violently condemned the racist system.

As early as 1968. the laws of apartheid followed one another in rapid succes-

' sion: 1948, a ban an interracial marriages; 1950. a ban on sexual relations
between the races: 1950, the Group Areas Act, strengthening residential segre-
gation; 1950 again. the Population Registration Act, institutionalizing racial
classification; 1953, the codification of apartheid in public places; 1955,
extension of the’code to transportation; and 1959, its extension to the univer-

slties.

In n 529-page work reviewing all laws containing references to race, a liberal
private institution, the South African Institute of Race Relations, notes:

29
son omcm. use ONLY
"while the measures introduced before 1948 were of an ad hoc nature, the legis-
lative program subsequently introduced followed a much more clearly defined

law aimed at implementing the racial policy of the government of the National
Party."

Theory and Practice of Segregation

The real theoretician of apartheid was the third nationalist prime minister,
Hendrik Verwoerd, named in 1958 and assassinated 8 years later. Verwoerd's
doctrine is clear: Regarding the Africans, every ethnic group (there are nine
main ones) must be considered as a "national unit" with its own territory,
where it will enjoy political rights that may go as far as sovereignty, with
the Whites maintaining their control over the rest of the country. Africans
residing in the "white zones" are considered to be migrant workers and their
number should decrease. There are consequently no South African citizens

with black skin. The Coloreds and Indians will be given the possibility of
managing their administration, while being subordinate to the central Hhite
Parliament. In order to show the path to follow in order to reduce the number
or Blacks in the "White zones," the wife of the prime minister has always re—
fused to accept Black domestics!

Vcrwoerd's doctrine was scrupulously applied. Residential segregation was
applied at the cost of hundreds of thousands of persons having to.be displaced.
Entire districts, "nonwhite" enclaves such as Sophiatown (Africans) in Johan-
nesburg or District Six (Coloreds) in the Cape. were razed and.their inhabi-
tants sent to the outlying areas of the cities. Verwoerd's successors never-
theless managed to reduce -7 on paper -- the Black population of South Africa
by over 8 million by giving them citizenship of "rump states" whose legal
existence is recognized only by Pretoria. These former Bantustans (as they we
were once called). made “independent," live only off Pretoria's subsidies and
the majority of their theoretical population lives permanently in the so-called
unite zones. Whether or not they are independent, the nine Bantustans —- with
a total of some 13 percent of South Africa's area - nevertheless perfectly
fulfill their role as a reservoir of labor and real "dying places" where
thousands of Blacks no longer wanted in the White zones are pushed.' He
visited Nondweni in northern Natal. on the edge of the Kwazulu bantustan. a
resettlement camp where every day, the Blacks pushed out of the White zones
are brought by truck and where no economic activity was possible. Having
visited one of these camps in eastern Cape Province, Bishop Tutu said he was
shocked to see human beings treated "like sacks of potatoes."

Today, the government goes abroad claiming that "apartheid is dead" (according
to Minister of Foreign Affairs Pieter-Koornhof before the National Press Club
in Washington in 1980). But it makes reference to what has been called "petty
apartheid": the segregation of public benches, elevators, luxury hotels.

This discrimination, the-most obvious and most shocking, has in fact been
lunoddown,even if it has not toally disappeared (the restaurant at the inter-
national airport of Johannesburg has been integrated. but not that of domestic
flights! Likewise, theaters are open to everyone, but not movie houses). The
fact remains that the changes made remain insignificant to the great majority
or the Blacks, who. in their daily lives. are above all marked by the ban .on

living where they want, the lack of any freedom to move about in the country
and the requirement to carry a pass stipulating the place of work and residence,
the inequality of wages for equal work. the absence of any political rights

and other basic rights such as freedom of expression. without mentioning an
omnipresent. merciless repression.

Legalized Repression

Along with this great design. the South African Government.stepped up its
repressive legislation enabling it to closely control the population and pre-
vent any dissent from apartheid. South Africa now has a hallucinating arsenal
of laws, many of which - ironically enough -- are comparable-to those of the.
Soviet Union. such as banishment or restrictions on movement within the country.
If, in Argentina. one "disappears" without leaving a trace. there exists. in
South Africa. a law making it possible to disappear "legally": the law on
terrorism. section 6 (the Terrorism Act). authorizing secret detention without
possibility of contact with one's family or a lawyer. for an indefinite period
of time. Several thousand persons have gone through the hands of the police
for varying lengths of time in recent years. It was during his detention

under such conditions that Hhite trade unionist Neil Aggett. involved in the
independent Black trade union movement. met death in February 1982: a suicide,
according to authorities. For South African jurist John Dugard, on the other
hand. "section 6 produces an environment of intimidation equivalent to torture."

The South African Government has repeatedly shown its determination to use
every possible means to maintain the status quo. The repression at the begin-
ning of the 1960's, with the massacre of 62 Black demonstrators in Sharpeville
and the imprisonment of the main Black leaders. such as Nelson Mandela (still
in prison) and Robert Sobukwe (now deceased), was followed by a long silence.
The international environment lent itself to it: Portuguese order still
reigned supreme in neighboring Angola and Mozambique. while Rhodesia was still
in "good hands."

Awakening of Resistance

It would be necessary to wait until 1975. with the "carnation revolutioﬁ' in
Lisbon and the collapse of the Portuguese empire. to witness the true awakening
of resistance to apartheid.’ The first street demonstration in several years
took place in June 1975 in Durban. in support of the Mozambican Liberation
Front (FRELIMO) of Samora Machel being'set up in Lourenco Marques (now Maputo).
the favorite resort place of White South Africans. It was no accident that
the Soweto riots broke out in June 1976: A few months previously. the South
African Army had had to withdraw from Angola without being able to prevent the
victory of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (HPLA) of Agos-
tinho Neto. supported by the'Cubans. The psychological impact of the failure
on Black opinion was considerable.

an end to separate "Bantu education," Pretoria responded with gunfire. In a
matter of weeks. there were over 600 dead. most from bullets. Several thou-
sand voung Blacks then went into exile and to guerrilla training camps in
Angola and Tanzania.

The government of John Vorster had hoped that by striking hard. it would obtain
[5 years of calm. as in 1960. But the international context had changed drama-
tically. For the first time. the South African bastion has common borders with
militant Black Africa: Mozambique. facing the Transvaal. and Angola. facing
Namibia.2 The guerrilla movements in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and Namibia thus
had rear bases and their activities were to experience a sharp increase.

Black Consciousness

Since 1976. South Africa has had no rest. It is not necessarily a matter of
bloody revolts. which alone make the front page of foreign newspapers. but

of a slow. sure rise of the resistance. June 1976 made it possible to dis-
rover a new generation of antiapartheid militants, who did not know the multi-
racial struggles of the 1950's and who had scarcely had any contact with tradi-
tional organizations. This new generation is that of “Black consciousnessness."
a philosophy whose "father." Steve Biko. died at the age of 30 in the hands of
Lhc police. in September 1977. Biko was the founder of a movement of Black
students. SASO [South African Students Organization]. born of a split in the
liberal. multiracial student union, NUSAS [National Union of South African
Students]. It rejected the paternalism of the White liberals and believed

that Blacks should assert their identity and free themselves before thinking
about cooperating with the Whites. It defined its attitude as follows: "Being
Black is not a question of skin color. It is the reflection of a mental atti-
tude. Simply by describing yourself as Black. you commit yourself to the path
of emancipation. You pledge to fight all forces seeking to use your blackness
[ncqritude] as a sign of submission."3 Consequently. today, the young Cdloreds
and Indians always describe themselves as Black. whatever the color of their
skin. Likewise, it was an Indian woman. sociologist Fatima Heer. now "ban-
ished." who was president of the Federation of Black “omen. one of the many
organizations following Biko's philosophy. Essentially nonviolent, this philo-
sophy was betting on the growing awareness of the African. Colored and Indian
population as a means of liberation. The Black consciousness had a consider-
able impact in South Africa, particularly through the churches.

John Vorstcr halted its development in October 1977. one month after the death
of Steve Biko. by banning 18 organizations and newspapers close to the Black
consciousness, including the Christian Institute of Southern Africa. headed

by an Afrikander. Beyers Naude. and by imprisoning their leaders. He thus de-
strnyed the last hopes of peaceful change which young Blacks still harbored.

his military wing, the Umkhonto He Sizwe (the nation's spearhead) had long
been paralyzed by the "protective glaze".of the Portuguese empire and "rebel"
Ian Smith. Since 1975. the ANC has experienced a profound revival. Following
the Soweto riots, the exiled president of the ANC. Oliver Tambo. told us:

"The movement was not planned by the ANC." But he added that despite its dis-
aureements with the slogans of young people, such as "Black Power," the ANC
hein§ for the establishment of a nonracial society, their paths would cross one
day. He was right and-since the 1977 repression, the ANC has come to the
forefront as the main opposition force. both inside and outside South Africa.

One significant fact: Steve Biko's heirs, particularly his former right arm,
Barney Pityana, are now all in the ranks of the ANC, despite their initial reti-
cence because of the pro-Soviet South African Cmmnunist Party (SAC?) within

the old nationalist movement.5 This influx of "new blood" into the ARC cannot
fail to influence the very nature of the organization. Several generations and
factions coexist. not without difficulty, but they make the ANC the inevitable
interlocutor of the government in Pretoria on the day -- probably still far
ahead -- when negotiations will have to be initiated between Whites and Blacks.

The ANC is now present on all fronts of the sntiapartheid struggle, directly or
indirectly. Hilitarily speaking, without falling into the trap of terrorism.

it has in recent years waged a number of spectacular actions against well-chosen
targets. which has had a profound psychological impact. Politically speaking.
the ANC undeniably enjoys the support of a majority of the Blacks. as proved

by the great popularity of Nelson Mandela despite his 17 years in prison, and
even of a small minority of Whites, Marxist but Christian as well.

Trade Union Movement

However. facing the South African military might, unequaled on the continent.
no one in the liberation movement thinks about bringing down the government
by bombs or by "liberating" rural areas, as in Zimbabwe or Mozambique. Since

South Africa is highly industrialized, one of the regime's weaknesses has to do
with its extreme dependency on Black labor. It was therefore not by accident
that a particularly militant Black trade union movement has developed in recent
years. especially since the major strikes in Durban in 1973. The number of

work stoppages has greatly increased in the past 2 years. The automobile indus-
try. concentrated in Port Elizabeth. was paralyzed by movements for demands.
These movements are generally actively relayed in compounds reserved for

Blacks. In the Cape, one strike of Black slaughterhouse workers resulted in a
long boycott of meat by the African and Colored communities.

Mainly existing in the major enterprises of industrial centers such as Johannes-
burg. Port Elizabeth. East London or the Cape. this trade union movement was
hard hit by repression at the end of 1981. They avoid encroaching on the poli-
tical domain. precisely in order not to leave themselves open to repression,

and the independent Black trade.unions consider themselves to be one of the
components of the movement to fight apartheid. "hen the leader of the Ford
workers. Thozamile Botha, a Black namesake of the prime minister who was ar-
rested and then banished by the government, fled from South Africa last year,

he immediately joined the ANC! Despite its divisions and the pressures ap-
plied to it. the young Black trade union movement is one of the main threats
to the regime of apartheid in the years to come.

Splits Among Hhites

This uninterrupted rise of the resistance has divided the white minority,
revealing splits between English-speakers and Afrikanders as well as within

the latter community. The “White tribe“ of South Africa is far from monolithic.
Between English- and Afrikaans—speaking Whites, there is a world of incompre-
honsion and distrust difficult to_eradicate. Each has its schools, its univer-
sities. newspapers and even churches. The former group remains liberal, in the
English sense of the term. and rejects racial discrimination, even if basically,
they would be little inclined to give up their privileges. Their main politi-
cal party, the Progressive Federal Party (PPP), although headed by a brilliant
Afrikander intellectual. Frederik Van Zyl Slabbert, mainly recruits its backers
in the smarter districts of Johannesburg and the Cape. Its main financial
supporter is none other than Harry Oppenheimer. the gold and diamond magnate,
chairman of the board of the Anglo—American Corporation and of De Beers. The
PFP. antiapartheid even if it does not go so far as to demand universal suf-
frage. constitutes the "official opposition" in the central Parliament in the
Cape. with 27 out of 177 deputies.

Opposite it, the National Party, in power since 1948. now scarcely constitutes
the monolith it has long been. An initial split of the right in 1970. led by
the former minister of posts and telecommunications -- the man who was Opposed
to the introduction of television out of fear of seeing communism infiltrate
the country by means of the tiny screen -- was skillfully contained by John
Vorster, then prime minister. But in recent years, a serious split has resur-
faced within the party between the verligte (enlightened) and verkrampte
(old-[ashioned) wings. Internal confrontations on the degree of reform to be
introduced lnto_the system of apartheid have just come to a conclusion with the
expulsion of the extreme right from the party at the beginning of Hatch and
the formation of a new pole of attraction within the Afrikanders, on the right
0| the National Party.

This conservative party of South Africa was set up by the former minister of
state administration, Andries Treurnicht. former pastor in the Dutch Reformed
Church. who is thus challenging Prime Minister Pieter Botha. accused of be-
traying Verwoerd's ideals. A significant fact. at the meeting to launch this
party on 20 March in Pretoria, amidst a truly neofascist atmosphere. the audi-
ence of over 7,000 persons was mainly made up of workers and "lower-class"
Whites. Likewise. Treurnicht obtained the rallying of Connie Mulder. former
minister of information in disgrace, recently overwhelmingly elected over the
retiring mayor of the National Party. in the Afrikander workers district of
Knudfnntein. near Johannesburg.

This split in the National Party undeniably expresses the sociological evolu-
tion of the Afrikandera. At the beginning of the century. the latter consti-
tuted a population of small farmers and workers in direct competition with
Black labor. Prom 75 percent rural Afrikanders in 1911, the figure is now

3h
roe omcnu. use ONLY

85 percent city dwellers. In the economic field. the share of the Afrikanders
in the private sector was only 9.8 percent in 1968. but it has risen to over
25 percent. One must now reckon with Afrikander capital: The third-ranking
private bank in South Africa. the Volkskas (set up in the 1930's by an Afri-
knnder secret society. the Broederbond), and the second-ranking mining firm.
General Mining. are controlled by Afrikanders. In the 1920's. Afrikander
workers invented a personage. Oggenheimer. inspired by Sir Ernest Oppenheimer.
founder of an industrial and mining empire, to symbolize English capitalism.
Today, the Afrikander owners of General Mining sit alongside Harry Oppenheimer
on the board of directors of the Mining Chamber! Even better. in 1979. both
English- and Afrikaans-speaking employers broke. with the complicity of the
Botha government, a general strike of White workers -- made up of 95 percent
Afrikanders -- set off by an extremist racist union to block the social advance—
ment of Black miners.

Era of the Managers: Adapt or Die

Pieter Botha embodies, despite his past as a party hack. this new generation
of Afrikander managers, formed both in the private as well as the important
public sector, prompt to sacrifice ideology to the needs of profitability.
Indeed. apartheid is not "profitable" in its original form, as Oppenheimer
has tried to demonstrate for years. Industry is now suffering from a scarcity
of skilled labor. There are no longer enough Whites and the rules of segre-
gation have prevented the training of Black apprentices! By the year 2000.
80 percent of the work force will be Black and there will be 2 million Blacks
in the secondary schools, compared with 300,000 Whites. Botha. advised by
business circles and. for different reasons. by army chiefs, wants to be a
reformist or rather. a modernist. Without totally giving up apartheid.

which is the maintenance of White domination, he is willing to make modifi-
cations in the system which his rightist opponents reject. "Adapt or die":
This has been Botha's slogan for 2 years, but his Afrikander voters have

not followed him. In the 1981 legislative elections. therefore. before the
split in the National Party. the HR? [Herstigte Nasionale Party]. the party
of the extreme right. tripled its votes. gaining a third of all Afrikander
voters.

It is true that the prime minister has never truly presented any precise pro-
gram. While he has taken a certain number of measures aimed at encouraging
the emergence of a Black petty bourgeoisie, he has always been vague on the
political level. He now speaks of "sharing power" with the Colored and
Indians. but at the same time. he assures people that the Whites are in no
way giving up their leadership position. At any rate, he excludes any asso-
ciation of the African majority with management of the country's affairs.
deeming that its fate is sealed by the Bantustans made "independent." such as

the Transkei. Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei. Freed of his right wing. will
notha be bolder? A first test will be his reaction to the proposals recently

made by a "moderate" Black leader, Chief Catsha Buthelezi, "prime minsiter" of
the Kwazulu Bantustan. who, rejecting the independence of his territory. put
together a formula for the sharing of power between Whites and Blacks on the
scale of Natal Province.

35
ran omcun. use ONLY
For the time being. Botha has enjoyed the support of business circles for
implementing his reformist policy. But he still has to prove his credibility
and some fear that he may try to check reforms in order to try to recover part
of the Afrikanders tempted by the extreme right. The traditional structures
of Afrikanerdom (Dutch reformed churches, cultural associations, Broederbond,
and so on) are stepping up pressure on the prime minister in order to solidify
Afrikander ranks. In their eyes. nothing justifies the division of the Volk.

As for the Blacks. they follow conflicts within the white minority with little
interest. believing that whether "enlightened" or "old-fashioned," apartheid
will not disappear as a result of the good will of those in power.

Economic Giant Supported by the West

The fact is that South Africa is not Rhodesia or Mozambique. The White popula-
tion is large (1 out of 5, compared with 1 out of 16 in Rhodesia) and above
all. its economic and military might is much greater. It suffices to recall
that South Africa is the world's largest producer of gold (58 percent of total
mmrld production). platinum. vanadium and chrome, the second-ranking producer
of manganese, the third-ranking producer of diamonds and asbestos and the
third-ranking producer of uranium in the Western world, without counting its
production and large reserves of coal, iron ore, copper, zinc, nickel, silver,
and so on. Only oil is lacking, but Pretoria has partially gotten around the
difficulty by producing synthetic oil from the liquefaction of coal!

Despite the serious current recession, partially due to the drop in the price
of gold ($850 an ounce 2 years ago; $330 in March 1982) and diamonds and to the
drop in the demand for ores in the West, the South African economy is a giant
on the continent. South Africans have nevertheless just bitterly noted.rbat,
like just another Third World country, they are vulnerable to fluctuatfﬁns in
the prices of raw materials. The 1982-1983 budget provides only $800 million
in revenue from the gold mines, compared with over $2 billion in 1981-1982.
After a period of strong growth (8 percent in 1980), South Africa is now in

a lasting recession. -Scarcely 1 percent growth is expected in the GNP this
year and the figure will be even smaller next year. This situation deals a
tmrsh blow to the efforts of South African leaders to reach a maximum level of
nutarchy. The current need to borrow on the international market and to at-
tract foreign capital, highly sensitive to political risk, greatly affects
this strategy of Pretoria. Hithin such a context, internal political choices
hang heavy and the prime minister must make difficult decisions in an unfavor-
able economic setting. ‘

In addition. South African military might, which is accompanied by an important
local weapons industry, remains without equal in the southern Sahara. Pretoria
was hit in October 1977 by an embargo of the UN Security Council on arms ship-
ments. But this measure came too late to affect South Africa. Thanks to the
purchase of many patents (particularly French). South Africa produces armored
cars, all kinds of weapons -- even the equivalent of the Soviet "Stalin

organs" (multiple rocket launchers) -- including the Mirage P-l frame. What

it does not manufacture. South Africa always finds ways of obtaining through
other means: The TIMES of London recently revealed that Israel was helping

Pretoria by supplying technicians and spare parts for the maintenance of its
Mirage-type fighter planes.

These few facts largely explain the Western support heretofore enjoyed by the
regime of apartheid, despite the moral condemnation it has aroused throughout
the world. For both economic and strategic reasons (the "Cape route." control
of ores. and so on). the West has mainly shut its eyes to the system of segre-
gation and exploitation. Even the socialist government of France has scarcely
acted during its first year in power to modify the nature of French-South Afric
African relations. Europe has been content to draft a code of conduct --
optional -- for subsidiaries of European multinational companies investing in
the country with rapid profits.

But it is mainly to the United States that one must turn. Washington now
has the greatest influence, politically and economically. in Pretoria and re-
mains. in the eyes of_South African leaders. the "leader of the Free World."
Ronald Reagan's-coming to power delighted the White South Africans. upset by
Carter's moralizing. They have not been disappointed. Washington is lifting.
one after another. the restrictions imposed by the preceding administration,
such as. for example, the delivery to South Africa of sophisticated computers
that can be used for defense or scientific research, or the delivery of non-
milltary equipment to the army (with weapons remaining subject to the UN em-
bargo imposed in 1977).

Backed by this American green light. granted in the name of the principle of
the containment of communism throughout the world, South Africa has embarked
upon an all—points strategy of destabilizing the regimes in neighboring coun-
tries. Angola is undergoing the main assaults. out of all proportion to the
situation in previous years. The southern region of the country is systema-
tically invaded by veritable armadas. to the shocking indifference of the rest
of the world. Hundreds of thousands of persons have fled their areas, which
have been turned into a no man's land. In Mozambique, Pretoria is encouraging
and arming a ”resistance movement“ opposed to the regime of Samora Machel.

It is as if Pretoria had opted for the policy of the worst. preferring to
deliver its neighbors over to Soviet "protection" in order to arouse a clearer
American commitment in its behalf.' How else is one to interpret the constant

attacks in Angola, when that country has stepped up its gestures of openness,
even to the United States (whose Gulf Oil company continues to work Angolan
oil as casually as can be) and brings all its weight to bear on the SWAPO
guerrilla soldiers. to which it gives asylum. on behalf;of a negotiated
settlement in Namibia?

Nothing of what the South African regime has undertaken at home or abroad in
recent years has unprimed the explosive climate reigning in the southern part
of the African Continent. If the rest of the world continues to stand idly

by. while profiting from'maintenance of the status quo. then the explosion will
not be long in coming, with incalculable consequences for the peoples in the

region and far beyond as well.

ZULU CHIEF 'DISILLUSIONED' WITH P. BOTHA
”01.0803 London THE TIMES in English 3 Jun 82 p 6

[Report on interview with Chief Minister of kwaZulu Chief Cotsha Buthelezi
by Michael Hornsby--date. place not given]

[Text] Buthelezi Ingwavuma--Polarization between Black and White in South
Africa has "never been worse than it is now," according to Chief
Gatsha Buthelezi, the leader of the country's six million Zulus.

He also now thinks that Mr P. W. Botha, the prime minister, is incapable
of being "a reformer outside the four corners of apartheid."

In :1 recent interview with THE TIMES, Chief Buthelezi, who is chief minister
of kwaZulu homeland where more than three million Zulus live, said his
disappointment was all the greater because he had been among those who had
been impressed by Mr Botha's promises of reform when he took office three and
a half years ago.

'Vhen he took office and expressed his determination to work not only for
Whites but also to work for Black people, 1 was impressed, and I said to

my people that this man must be given a chance because he could not be
expected to undo the damage of so many generations at the stroke of a pen."

Chief Buthelezi is now convinced those hopes were misplaced. He was parti-
cularly disillusioned by Mr Botha's apparent determination to press ahead with
proposals to give the franchise to Coloureds (those of mixed race) and Asians
(mainly Indians) at the expense of the African three-quarters of the popula-
tion. who would be left to exercise such political rights as the process

in the scattered homelands.

Calling the proposal "a real monstrosity," Chief Buthelezi warned Coloureds and
Asians that if they were seen to be "in cahoots with the ruling White minority
in this country they would become as much a target of Black hatred and resent-
ment as whites," which could only complicate the racial conflict.

Earlier this year the multiracial Buthelczi Commission. set up by the kwaZulu
legislative assembly, offered an alternative constitutional model with its
proposal for merging kwaZulu and the Province of Natal into a racially-
lntegrated regional administration with universal franchise, in which Whites
would be protected by a minority veto.

Chief Buthelezi said that this was as far as he could go to accomdate Whites
without losing credibility among his own people. The scheme has been warmly
supported by the (white) opposition Progressive Federal Party, but was curtly

rejected by the ruling National Party which refined even to give evidence to
the Comission.

Another blow to Chief Buthelezi has been the discovery of plans by the govern-
ment to cede part of kwaZulu and the whole of the Swazi honeland of kaNgwane
to Swaziland, apparently in an attempt to buy Swaziland's friendship and to
deprive some 750,000 local Swazis of their South African citizenship.

If the cession of kwaZulu territory is carried out there seems little doubt
it would mark a Rubicon in Grief Buthelezi's relations with Pretoria.

Arguably, he is the only Black leader who could still hope to negotiate a
bloodless political compromise with the ruling white elite and retain
sufficient popular legitimacy to make it stick.

But, while Chief Buthelezi still remains massailable in Natal and kwaZulu,
opinion surveys show that in other parts of the country he has fallen well

behind the imprisoned leaders of the ANC as the min symbol of Black
resistance to apartheid.
