SWISS FOREIGN TRADE WITH AFRICA REVIEHBD
Paris HARCHES TROPICAUX ET MEDITERRANEENS 1n Preach Ho 1887, 8 Jan 82 pp 68-71

[Excerpt] The flow of trade to and fron Africa remains nodest. But it is cer-
tainly inproving and expanding since in 1979 the African continent accounted for
3.08 percent of the Swiss Confederation's total foreign trade while in 1980 that
percentage had increased to 3.6 percent. During these 2 years, the value of
Swiss inports increased at a faster rate (up by 66.7 percent) than the value of
exports (up by 35.7 percent) but, in the view of eone observers, the signifi-
cance of that progression is linited and they point out that it is nainly the
result of Switzerland purchasing energy products fron four of five African coun-
tries. They also note rhst the trade gap between Switzerland and Africa indi-
cates a big surplus in favor of Switzerland (a cover percentage of 156.37 in
1980). But it must be noted that in 1979 that rate was even higher (166.61 per-
cent).

Crude Materials Other Than Foodstuffs

The leading Swiss imports of African crude materials other than foodstuffs
(representing 90 million 8!") are animal or plant fibers. These are followed
by sawmill products, nonmetallic ores, metal ores and various products.

quartz, feldspar, clays, granite and various other ores.

Mention must be made of imports of ivory, shell, horns, various by-products of

other hand, gums and other forest products accounted for purchases worth 900,000
SF (mainly for Sudan: 282 tons worth 770,000 SF).

Semi-Processed Products, Chiefly Metallic Ones

African semi-processed products imported by Switzerland (those categories which
are unquestionably semi-processed) accounted for around 30 million SF'and most
of this sum represents aetal products (23.5 million). These metal products were
chiefly: aluminum (17.23 million SF) most of which came from Egypt (6,238 tons;
17.2 million 5?); copper (626 tons; 2.41 tons million SP) from South Africa

(500 tons) and Zambia (126 tons): nickel (77 tons; 800,000 SE) from South Africa

Manufactured and other products imported from Africa (not counting foodstuffs
which are listed separately) consist of cotton fabrics, a few items of clothing,
wood articles, jewelry articles, rubber articles, handicraft items and collec-
tor's items.

Swiss Exports to Africa

Regarding exports, we will not review Switzerland's trade with its 54 African
clients. He shall examine only exports to the 25 major clients, pointing out
that the purchases made by these countries amount to 2,352.7 million SF and
represent 97.6 percent of the Swiss sales to the Black Continent. The figures
given are, therefore, highly significant. We could have almost restricted our
survey to the five top African clients of Switzerland-Nigeria, South Africa.
Egypt, Algeria and Libya--which, in 1980, accounted for 1,766 million SP worth
of goods representing 72.85 percent of all Swiss exports to that part of the
world.

Swiss sales to Africa can be classified under 15 or so categories (in paren-
theses, chapters of the NdB [Brussels list]; figures rounded up in millions of
Swiss francs):

1. Nonelectrical machinery and devices (84) 798
‘2. Chemical products (28 to 38) 575
3. Electrical machines and electrical material (85) 295
4. Watches and clocks (91) 134.5
5. Metals and metal goods (73 to 83) 118.5
6. Foodstuffs and related products (01 to 04, 0.7 to 12, 15 to 24) 103.5
7. Textiles. clothing articles and accessories (50 to 67) 95
8. Optical, photographic, measuring and precision instruments (90) 85.5
9. Resins and plastic goods (39) 26
10. Paper and paper goods (47 to 49) 22
ll. Precious metals. gems, jewelry, goldsmith articles (71) 20
12. Means of transportation (86 to 89) 19
13. Construction materials (68 to 70) 10
14. Musical instruments and sound equipment (92) 8
15. Rubber and rubber goods (40) 4
l6. Hood and wooden goods (44 to 46) 3.6
17. Miscellaneous and unspecified 35.2

Outstanding Position of Textile Industry Machinery

One can see the outstanding position occupied by nonelectrical machines and
instruments (33.1 percent of all exports) and by chemical products (23.85 per—
cent).

Under the category of nonelectrical machines and instruments. there are two or
three main types of goods. A detailed study of the purchases made by the six
major African clients of Switzerland (for these machines)--South Africa, Nigeria
Algeria, Egypt, Libya and Cameroon--shows that their aggregated imports totaled
667.3 million SP distributed as follows: textile machinery, 347.18 million (52

Textile machinery occupies a very strong position with 122.32 million SP worth
of exports to Algeria; 102.43 million to Nigeria; 67.97 million to South Africa;
52.7 million to Egypt, and so on. These purchases cover a wide range of equip-
ment. For instance, the following export orders went to Algeria (in millions
of Swiss francs):

Weaving looms, knitting and embroidery machines 57.40
Spinning machines 39.80
Hashing, cleaning, drying, dyeing machines 20.87
Auxiliary machines required by weaving looms, embroidery machines, etc 4.13

Most of the exports of machine tools went to South Africa (26.46 million),
Egypt (5.26 million), and Nigeria (4.10 million).

Chemical Products

Chemical products (chapters 28 to 38 of the Brussels' List [NdB]) were exported
to many African countries (see Table CE-SS-F) but more particularly to Nigeria
(116.45 million), South Africa (111.03 million), Egypt (75.5 million), Angola
(40.44 million), Sudan (32.02 million) and Libya (24.61 million).

Four categories of chemical products occupy a very strong position: basic or-
ganic compounds, coloring substances and disinfectants. Practically every
country bought drugs but the biggest buyers were Nigeria (32.74 million), Angola
(26.09 million), South Africa (24.4 million), Sudan (1837 million), Libya (15.70
million) and Egypt (15.1 million).

The organic compounds, for the most part diazine, aside, azoxide compounds, com-
pounds with amide, amine and oxygenated functions, heterocyclic compounds, sul-
fonamides, and others were purchased in large amounts by South Africa (34.28

million), Nigeria (33.99 million), Egypt (26.02 million), the Ivory Coast (8.05

(Table COM-IT-B and Chart COH-IT-l): Italy's overall trade with this continent
increased in total value by 36.06 percent over 1979; as a percentage of Italy's
total foreign trade, it has gone from 9.57 to 10.66; the trade balance, however,
which is still generally in Africa's favor. lost 3.7 points from 1979, with

Table COH-IT-F gives the details of petroleum and coal purchases which repre-
sent, in value, close to two-thirds of Italy's total imports from Africa
(62.9 percent). The leading position of Libya, a former Italian colony which
covers practically half of the peninsula's purchases of African petroleum,
will be noted. The largest supplier of coal is South Africa, of course.

361 Billion Lire in Coffee and Cocoa Purchases

Second, we will examine'raw or processed food products (643 billion lire),
although they are normally found only in third position after nonfood raw
materials (976 billion). This will enable us to free the "raw materials"
sector of any items for human or animal consumption, including manufactured
products.

Three categories of food products must be distinguished: 1) rev agricultural
products, 442 billion lire; 2) processed agricultural products, 163 billion;
and 3) raw or processed animal products, 58 billion.

Among the raw agricultural products, two categories are conspicuous, coffee
and cocoa: coffee (275 billion lire); cocoa (86); tropical fruits (29);

grain (13.2): dried vegetables (10.6); oil seeds (6.3); fresh vegetables (5.8);
citrus fruit (5.1); tea, spices (1.9); temperate zone fruit (1.6); and

other miscellaneous products (7.7).

The principal African suppliers of coffee and cocoa to Italy are shown in
Table COH-IT-G. The Ivory Coast is the leader by far for both products.
After the Ivory Coast, the countries which supplied the most unroasted coffee
to Italy in 1980 were: Zaire, Cameroon, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Uganda.
The principal suppliers of cocoa, besides the Ivory Coast, were: Nigeria,
Benin, Cameroon, Ghana and Togo.

Almost all of the Italian exports to Africa consisted of industrial products:
98 percent of the total value.

Agricultural and mineral raw materials did not exceed 66.2 billion lire and
were distributed as follows: agricultural products, 36; aninsl husbandry, 6.6;

forestry, 0.1.; fishing and hunting, 0.2; natal-bearing ores, 0.5; nonnetal
minerals, 21.9.

For agricultural products, the 36.8 billion lire included grain (13.03),
fruit (9.9), vegetables (6.94), spices (1.1), miscellaneous products (5.83).

Nonmetsl materials, especially marble, mostly went to Libya (7.22), Algeria (5.68)
and Egypt (2.6).

The breakdown of exports of industrial products is as follows (in billion lire);

Machinery 3,303.5
Chemical products 1,035.5
Metallurgical products 629
Food industry products 392
Textiles and related products 379.2
Construction materials 281.4
Lumber products 187.8
Paper industry products 56.1
Animal or vegetable processed

waste 1.2.9
Printing industry products 20.6
Alcohol and tobacco 9.3
Leather and hides 8

Miscellaneous and indeterminate 375. 6

Under machinery there are four categories: machines and equipaent, 1.1.07.5 billion
lire; optical, watchnslting, precision and measuring instruments, 128.2 billion; -
transport equipment, 1,079.3 billion; other products such as hardware, tools.
nails, screws and bolts, etc., 688.5 billion.

Machines and Equipment

Monelectric machines and equipment (1,088.12 billion lire) were exported much
more than electrical equipnent (319.36 billion). Table cou-rr-n shows the
purchases of Italy's top 20 African customers in these categories.

As far as nonelectric nachines and equipment are concerned, the breakdown of
sales by type of equipment is rather difficult to establish, since almost

Although steadily growing, the volume of trade between the UBBL and the African con-
tinent is still low-6.5 percent of the union's purchases all over the world, and
6.6 percent of its sales. One notices that the total value of the UBBL's trans-
actions with its top partner is 6.5 times higher than its transactions with the
entire African continent (South Africa included).

Trade Between the UEBL and Africa

The policy followed by Belgium and Luxembourg in their trade with Africa countries
is the result of two basic features. First, there is the legacy of the colonial
period; because of it, Belgium has large interests in Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi
despite nationalization measures, particularly in the mining companies of Sheba
Province. This channeling of foreign trade toward forner colonies is now curtailed
by Zaire's financial difficulties.

Second, there is the fact that. after making several attempts to penetrate the
African market--some more successful than others--Be1gium has considerably increased
its activities in the three countries that have the best development potential or
the most prosperous financial situation, meaning Nigeria, Libya, and Algeria.
Algeria and Nigeria were among the world's 12 top clients of the UEBL in 1980.

In these countries, Belgian companies conduct their operations mainly in the sectors
of public works and construction, engineering, and transportation. 0n the other
hand, these three countries provide a good part of the UBBL's supplies of oil and
natural gas.

Overall, the UEBL's imports from Africa are marked by the predominance of a single
industrial sector. It is the nonferrous industry in the case of Zaire, phosphates

for Morocco, and textiles for Tunisia. Liberia sells diamonds and nonferroua metals
to the UEBL.

A large portion of the UEBL's sales to Africa consists of products from its metal-
transforming industry (such as automobiles and other transport vehicles, and the
iron and steel industry) and of products from its chemical industry.

Imports From Africa

Over 50 percent of the UEBL's imports from Africa fall under three large categories
of commodities: mineral products, including petroleum products, worth 28.297.760.000
Belgian francs and representing 29.9 percent of all imports from Africa; common
metals and goods made of these metals, worth 18.656.470.000 and representing 19.7
percent: gems and precious metals, worth 5,896,000,000 or 6.2 percent.

Other groups of some importance are: textile materials and goods, worth 3,144.18
million (3.3 percent of the imports); products from the plant kingdom, mostly food
products worth 2,515.34 million (2.7 percent); Processed food products, beverages,
tobacco worth 2,096.12 million (2.2 percent).

These products make up 64 percent of all of the purchases in Africa by the UEBL.

Mineral products purchased in Africa are mostly energy producing: hydrocarbons,
coal, and coke. The main suppliers of hydrocarbons are Nigeria, with 1,591,955.6
tons (12.03 billion Belgian francs); Algeria, 623,829 tons (5.5 billion); Libya,
206,261.3 tons (1.7 billion); Gabon, 119,903.1 tons (878.9 million); Ansela,
35,597.3 tons (282.6 million).

Coal comes from South Africa, which supplies 2,092,046 tons (worth 2.6 billion
Belgian francs): no coal was imported from Zaire in 1980.

Next in the list are the metal ores. Iron ore comes from: Liberia, 1,269,125 tons
(832.2 million); Mauritania, 882.455 tons (700.2 million); Algeria, 805,253 tons
(441.5 million); South Africa, 343.250 tons (254.4 million). In 1980, overall
imports of iron ore dropped by 22 percent compared to 1979. This decline applies
to all four countries.

Manganese ore comes from South Africa, 122,097 tons (214.8 million); Gabon (trans-
ported through the Congo), 63,467 tons (128.2 million); Ghana, 13,908 tons (28
million); Zaire, 33,634 tons (68.4 million).

Lead ore cones from Morocco, 5,528 tons (137.6 million), as does zinc ore, 475 tons
(4.1 million).

Most of the phosphate comes from Morocco, which accounts for 1,450,073 tons (2.5
billion Belgian francs). but it is also imported from Tunisia, 45,161 tons (47.6
million), and from Togo, 213,815 tons (418.5 million).

It should be noted that 1,983.5 tons of ceramic clay were imported from Mozambique,
but this was much less than the amount imported in 1979 (down by 54 percent in terns
of tons).

Comon metals and metal goods imported by the UEBL from Africa involve only some
specific metals (copper, iron, nickel, aluminum) and the suppliers are few in num-
ber. Host of the purchases (over 90 percent) consist of copper from Zaire,

253,546.5 tons (16 billion Belgian francs), South Africa, 43,426.5 tons (3.2 billion),
and Zambia, 21,533.2 tons (1.5 billion).

Ferrous products come from Egypt, which provides 6,956 tons of sheet metal (71.6

million), and from South Africa, which supplies 8,039 tons (220.4 million) of metal
bars and settions, and particularly alloys.

In 1980, the amount of aluminum and almimn goods purchased by the 0831. increased
sharply. These purchases were made in Gianna, 10,052 tons (512.3 million); in Egypt,
1,271 tons (66 million); and in Zaire (16 tons).

Purchases of precious metals, gems, jewels, and coins represent 5,112,820,000
Belgian francs and were mostly diamonds. It should he noted that no purchases were
made in the Central African Republic in 1980 under this category. These purchases
are as follows (in millions of Belgian francs): South Africa, 3,259.3; Congo,
1,001.4; Sierra Leone, 372.3; Tanzania, 234.2; Mauritius Island, 99.1; Tunisia,
88.3; Ghana, 38.5; Liberia, 15.4; Burundi, 4.3 (only coins).

Let us point out that the products known as tropical and Mediterranean products,
which represent. as a rule, the largest part of the purchases made by European
countries in Africa, account for less than 10 percent of the UEBL's total purchases
in that continent. In the case of the union, Africa is chiefly a supplier of raw
materials for its industry-mad particularly for its metal industry.

Purchases of fruit amount to some 1.4 billion Belgian francs. Purchases made in
South Africa totaled 50,150 tons and included 22,361 tons of citrus fruit (346.6
million Belgian francs), 19,512 tons of potatoes (443.5 million), 3,553 tons of
pears (93.9 million), and 3,231.2 tons of grapes (151.2 million). Morocco supplied
15,911 tons of citrus and other fruits (238.4 million); the Ivory Coast, 4,660.5
tons of tropical fruits (107.5 million); and Swaziland, 507.8 tons of citrus fruits
(8.5 million).

The 0881. buys its supplies of coffee mainly from six countries, and the total
amount purchased was 7,648 tons. The purchases are distributed as follows: Kenya
with 2,654 tons (322.9 million Belgian francs); Zaire with 1,652.6 tons (153.8
million); Cameroon with 1,512.5 tons (151.4 million); Uganda with 768.7 tons

(72.8 million); Ethiopia with 667.3 tons (74.7 million); Burundi with 392.9 tons
(40.1 million).

A total of 27 million Belgian francs were spent in purchases of spices from Mada-
gascar (24.7 million) and Rwanda.

Imports of cocoa and cocoa-flavored products are rather low. They are worth 780.5
million Belgian francs and come from the Ivory Coast, with 3,813.4 tons; Nigeria,
with 1,886.4 tons; Zaire, with 1,137.3 tons; Ghana, with 590.6 tons; Togo, with

Grain imports worth 152.3 million Belgian francs come from Tanzania (15,654.4 tons),
Sudan (5,980.3 tons), Morocco (2,401.4 tons); 766.7 tons of rice come from Egypt
(6.2 million).

Imports of pulses from Tanzania, which were particularly high in 1979 (34,739 tons),
amounted to only 8,301 tons in 1980. The amount purchased in Morocco also dropped

sharply-«from 3,133 tons in 1979 to 1,673.3 tons in 1980. On the other hand,
2,945.8 tons of pulses were purchased from Ethiopia, 3,575.2 tons from the Canary
Islands, 927.6 tons from Kenya, and 287.4 tons from Egypt.

Overall, purchases of pulses accounted for 252.9 million Belgian francs, compared to
414 million in 1979.

Vegetable oils (worth 156 million Belgian francs) were purchased from South Africa,
1,690.9 tons; the Ivory Coast, 2,029.2 tons; Senegal, 1,812.3 tons; Zaire, 1,771
tons; Morocco, 40.8 tons.

It should be noted that 270.7 million Belgian francs were spent to purchase
pharmaceutical plants and cinchona bark. They were purchased in the following
countries: Cameroon, Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi.

Several sugar-producing countries sold molasses. These countries are: Mauritius
Island (3,823.2 tons), Madagascar (8,862.7 tons), Kenya (5,390.2 tons), and Sudan
(1,697.9 tons). .

Oilcake was bought from Sudan (3,158.9 tons), Zaire (1,489.8 tons), and Ghana
(180 tons).

The North African countries sell wine to the UBBL. The value of these sales is
divided as follows: 136.4 million Belgian francs for Tunisia, 50.8 million for
Morocco, and 21.1 million for Algeria.

There are six major suppliers of raw or manufactured tobacco: South Africa,
12,084.1 tons; Cameroon, 1,060.2 tons; Malawi, 893.3 tons; Mozambique, 236.6 tons;
Tanzania, 130.3 tons; Madagascar, 38.4 tons. This represents purchases with a
total value of 653 million Belgian francs.

Under the heading of textiles, the raw materials purchased by the UBBL in Africa
consist, for the most part, of cotton, wool and sisal.

In 1980, purchases of raw and unginnsd cotton, cotton fibers and cotton fabrics
basically amounted to 1.21 billion Belgian francs. They are distributed as follows
(in tons):

Items made of textiles accounted essentially for 1,302.7 million Belgian francs
and they were imported from Tunisia (1,157.6 million) and Morocco (145.1 million).
They consisted of hosiery items and clothing.

In the sphere of timber, for which Africa is a major world exporter, purchases
were made in 10 countries--with particularly large amounts in two-for a total
value of 1,868,000,000 Belgian francs.

The UEBL's purchases of raw rubber in Africa came mostly from Zaire (572.4 tons),
Cameroon (311.8 tons), the Ivory Coast (148.9 tons), and Liberia (32 tons). They
represent a total value of 45.4 million Belgian francs.

The UEBL does not import many processed chemical products from Africa, except for
phosphate byproducts such as anhydride or phosphoric acid from South Africa
(19,993.6 tons, worth 106.3 million Belgian francs) and from Tunisia (7,251.6 tons,
worth 53.4 million).

Exports to Africa

We will not give the details of the UBBL's exports to Africa. It is sufficient

to know that, although they are rather well distributed on the whole, these exports
involve mostly machinery and common metal products, meaning capital goods generally
intended for the industrial sector. These items represent approximately one-third
of the sales.

HISEHAN HAKPA‘IE BA 0" LIFE IN AFRICA

Paris JEUNE ARIQUE in French Ho 1095. 30 Dec pp 86-90

[Interview with Prof Asadou Ila-pate Ba on life in Africa and prospects for 1982. by
JEUIIE mamas correspondent Siradiou Diallo: an. and place not giveﬂ

ﬁery Pros every part of the continent they cone to Abidjan to
absorb eagerly the words of the ”eldest son of the centuy.” For

he is the aesory of the black people. And one of their asssengers
of hope.

Born at the dawn of 1900. he is pleased with the title. ”eldest son of the century."
his eyes still lively and aobile behind the fine glasses of a retired professor. his
face round and his chin adorned with a white soatee. Auden Haapaxs Ba soaetinee
resembles an elderly wisenan who has Just energed m an oriental tale and at other
tiles a dervish telling his beads without regard for the passage of ties. But he is
above all a wise-an in the ancient sense of the tern. a scholar. that is. s an who
has a precise knowledge of creatures and things. '

Descendant of a great Peulvan faaily from Macias. this Italian is. in fact, a poet
when he so desires, a philosopher, writer, inn and talented storyteller. Fomr
aesber of the Executive Council of UNESCO. Ila-pate Ba. who was also Hodiho Kei‘za's
aabsssador to Ivory Coast, settled in Abidjan any years ago. More wecisely. he
settled in the popular sector of the Harcory quarter where his nodest villa is both
a haven of peace and an extraordinary crossroads of African thought.

Visitors of all ages and conditions coae there. Sole to request the “Master's" ad-
Vice full of wisdoa. others eagerly to absorb his words. And thus renew. if only
durine a nonent's escape froa the office. friendship with this inexhaustible well
of African wisdos.

During the three conversation aeetings we had with this elderly scholar with the
alert mind and charming observations. we set up with top officials. students. busi-
nessmen and politicians. He even case across the daughter of ”ismrin.” the hero
of Haspate Ba'e latest novel.

Sitting enthroned on the divan-bed of the living rooa where he receives his visi-
tors or seated in front of a desk buried beneath piles of books and docuaents of
all sorts and tires. this astonishing person displays nosing activity despite his

age. And without ever losing his pleasant acod or sense of huaor. His observations.
studded with African proverbs and marine. soaetiles give way to apt forlulae eons of
which have aade their way around the world. “In Africa.“ he wrote some years ago to
UNESCO, "every tine an old Ian dies. it is a library which burns!"

Since one never tires of hearing Haapate Ba, we are pleased to announce that the
eainent 'Hawdo" (elderly wiseaan in the Peulvan language) is preparing an autobiog-
raphy in three volumes. This work will not only iaprove the aind but also find its
place in libraries throughout the world. Ilhile awaiting this enriching reading as-
terial. let us listen to the interview which. in the for. of wishes for 1982. Haapate
Ba was kind enough to grant us.

mum: marque ﬁg: As 1982 dawns, nest of the African states are 21 years old.
Hhst lesson do you draw free these years of independence?

Aaadou Hanpate Ba [ARE]: In my opinion. this period represents a great school more
than anything else. the school of life. It has penitted all Africans who think to
becoae better acquainted. And also to becoae better acquainted with the rest of the
world where they had little opportunity to go durirg the colonial period.

By discovering our differences. we can understand the causes of our autual lack of
understanding. And sake the necessary effort not only to overcome our backwardness
but also to live in peace with the other peoples of the world.

JA: Are Africans living better now than 21 years ago?

AHB: It all depends on what you mean by living better. Does it mean living in more
comfortable houses and partaking of tasty foods. or else. living in peace with one-
self? In my opinion. living well infers that one has a comfortable aaterial life
and a well-rounded spiritual life. but free of all bigotry.

JA: Do you think we are better off aaterially than before?

AHB: I an not too sure... (Silence) I believe that a large number of Africans
have acquired a certain amount of aaterial comfort they did not even think existed
in the pest.

JA: .Is it bad to try to acquire material contort?

AHB: Material coafort is necessary. for it represents good support for the body.
And the body being our vehicle in our passage through life. it is essential that it
be well cared for. But one should not forget that the body is not the entire nan.
Happiness is not confined to aaterial comfort. If this were not so. how do you
explain that millionaires commit suicide? Material ccrfort provides rest for the
body: it does not bring peace to the heart. Hultiailllonairee often need tran-
quilizers and sleepim pills to sleep.

JA: Are the inhabitants of developed countries less happy because they do not have
a tranquil existence?

g.

AHB: 'Jhy, yes: because sleep is the thsrloaeter of good health and, therefore, of
body peace. The "eat no lonqer sleeps; it is ill.

JA: Africa sleeps but is not in better health.

AHB: Africa does not Just sleep; it also laughs. Laughing, you see. is the ther-

aoneter of peace in the heart. Africa law" that is proof that it is in good
hedu‘e

JA: In large African aetropolises they have less and less tine to laugh.

AHB: That is true. However. do not forget that African cities are only Africanised
cities. for they are patterned after European or Alerican cities. African wisdoa
would have us copy the technique of the whites to achieve coafort in our body while
preserving peace in our heart. But I recognise that this is difficult.

JA: Do you consider yourself a happy Ian?

AHB: (Long silence)... Happiness is so relative! One can live with peace in one's
heart without peace in one's body and be happy. One can live without coafort and be
happy. because one has peace in one's heart. Inasmuch as--deepite q age-~I have no
difficulty digesting my food. sleeping and laughing. I can say that I as a an ap-
proaching happiness.

JA: There are very few individuals who. like you. can aspire to happiness.

AHB: For my part. I consider ayself a happy nan. for I have no political probleas.
money matters or concerns about ay secm‘ity. I can even tell you that I .aa full of

happiness. for I have the skin of a crocodile, the stoaach of an ostrich and the
heart of a turtledove.

Yes. I have the skin of a crocodile. for I can lie down mywhere without any prob-
lea: I do not need comfort to sleep well. I have the stoaach of an ostrich in the
sense that I eat amthing without having any problen in digesting. Lastly. I have
the heart of a turtledove. for I do not get angry and do not fight with anyone.

JA: All that is also the secret of your longevity. is it not?

AHB: If you wish. In any case. I consider that the secret of av happiness. which
is perhaps that of w longevity. rests as much on my desire and need to serve (God
and my fellow am) as on the strong aversion I have to ordering others about, which
I refuse to do.

JA: During the past 20 years have Africans done all they should have done to get
Africa out of the rut?

AHB: I believe that the Africans devoted enough effort but were lacking in leans.
He had freedon of speech but not freedom of action. ‘de are still dependent in that

respect. for one is always the son of one's instructor. The educator takes prece—
dence over the producer.

JM That is one of the biggest weaknesses of Africans.

AHB: It is all the more serious in that we have been conditioned not to be able to
do without what we do not produce.

JA: 'de are also reproached with beirg lasy...

AHB: That is only a slogan which has no meaning and, in a word. is said to make our
life more complicated. Are not those who reproach us for our alleged lasiness the
same ones who invented the expression: "to work like a nigger”? You know. one does
not sow in unplowed land. The Nest arrived in Africa with its horns and ideals to
try to sake a clean sweep of our customs, ideas and habits. Let the Heat help us

use the tractor or penicillin. agreed. But. for goodness' sake. let it keep its
hands off our customs and values!

JA: ‘dhst does time represent for you?

MB: In traditional Africa tine did not count. That is why I think that anyone who
constantly says he has no tine to lose should not come to Africa. Having said that.
I recognise that bad use of time does not promote development. Africans who have
received sodern education should take that into consideration in acting and behaving
in accordance with the modern norms which imply that ”tile is money."

JA: How do you explain the instability of African regimes?

AHB: I know that everything is not perfect in those regimes. There are even any
weaknesses. injustices and errors. But, believe me, lost of the coupe d'etat and
other attacks to which the African governsents are subject stem fro- the passion.
longirg and desire to govern. The famous "Get out of there and leave me some room”
has. alas. become a law of contesporary Africa. a product of the times.

JA: Nevertheless. there are certain abuses one cannot accept. Everythirg must have
limits. even the power of our heads of state.

AHB: It is true that excesses are committed by certain African regimes. I know

that in a democracy those who are elected comply with the wishes of the voters. and
not the opposite. But. with some exceptions. it is not this or that head of state
who is a despot or tyrant. It is the regime itself which. in essence. is despotic.

tyrannical .

JA: when the regime is tyrannical. it is normal for one to want to change it. even
if one has no political ambition.

MB: In any case. people are always glad to change leaders. It anuses them. Like
a little girl who tirelessly beheads her doll so that each time her parents will buy
her a new one. If it were up to the people. the leader would be killed every day‘ to
find than a new replscanent. The misfortune of isportant individuals always gives
pleasure to the unimportant. It is the people who are unstable: that is why the
leaders mistrust them.

36

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
JA: What. then. is the nature of power?

AHB: Power is. alas. like alcohol. After the first glass. one is as merry as a
lamb. Hith the second. it is as though one had eaten the flesh of a lion. One

feels so strong that one is no longer willing to be challenged. One wants to lord

it over everyone like the lien on the plain. Hith the third glass. one is like a
pig; one can do only indecent things.

JA: Then. there are at least three phases of power?

AHB: Yes. The first phase corresponds to the period when the leader is as kind
and gentle as a lab. The second is when the leader. considering hiaself an abso-
lute monarch. becomes formidable. But at that point he is only feared. Finally.

when the leader reaches the third phase of his power. he is not only feared but de-
tested by his people.

JA: Is it not because they reaain in power too long that mam African leaders end
up being hated?

ma: You know. there is no good leader but a future one. Despotism is part of
being human. What I resent in the present African leaders is less their despotism
than their lies. Every day they lie to their people. while nothing obliges them
to do so. As they are despots. they do not have any accounts to render to their
people. They do as they please. Since that is the case. I do not see why they
feel the need to lie. That is both sad and humiliating for us.

JA: In Africa. all the voices which are ordinarily inclined to be the conscience
of the people became silent. one after the other. for fear of having to answer to

those in power: this includes the unions. youth. students and even the elderly.
what do you think of this submission?

AHB: The silence of the elderly is explained by a serious deception. During the
colonial period. you renenber. aware that they were risking their freedom and some-
times their life. the elderly were not afraid to speak. to criticize the govern-
nent's excesses. Now that their children have replaced the colonial administra-
tors. what do you expect the elderly to ear?

The elderly are frankly troubled. All the more so. inasmuch as the children are
proVing to be more violent. sore wicked and more brutal than the colonial adminis-

trators. The elderly are so astonist that they prefer to keep their mouth closed
and die of chagrin rather than have to condemn their children.

JA: In the traditional Africa. did the government systems contain opposition?

AHB: Absolutely. with the "sansnkoun." our traditional regimes had judicious and

effective opposition. There were people who were permitted to tell the king a few
plain truths with no risk whatever.

JA: Traditional regimes then adaitted the existence of contradictions in society?

37
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

AHB: You know, horizontal uniformity and total harmony are. not of this world. Ab-
solute equality exists only at the horison. But the horizon is never reached. for
it recedes as one advances. That is why movement is mandatory. Our traditional

societies were so aware of this that our wisemen said that life is movement and that
movement begins with contradiction snore the members (feet. legs. arms...)

To say that someone had died. one said that his feet were equal. th? Because. so

long as one is alive, one has unequal feet. It is contradiction which enables soci-
ety to advance. ﬂoncontradiction is the equivalent of death. Progress results from
discussion and criticism. not to mention contradiction.

JM Do you think communism has a future in Africa?

AHB: As soon as someone asks me to prophesy. I feel ill at ease. I cannot speak of
the future. for, being a Muslim, I believe that the future belongs to Allah the All-
Powerful. To return to the subject of communism, I shall say that Africa has no

lesson in collectivism to receive fron anyone. At all times Africans have basked in
a communal world. Even if they wanted to break loose from that type of arrangement.

they could not do so. for this system is an integral part of their life. of their
manner of thinking. of their entire being.

JIM And what about capitalism?

AHB: I am not a capitalist and shall undoubtedly never be one. The old man. which
I as. has always had a simple and modest life. But I am not ashamed to admit that
between capitalism and communism my preferences are for the former.

I prefer capitalism because it promotes competition. Without considering that con-
trolled finance has failed everywhere. Is it a risk! I do not believe so. I am

convinced that only private ownership can enable a society to prosper. for the owner
works first for himself.

JA: But capitalism also has its faults.

AHB; Of course; and I am not unaware of then. I shall even say that it is desir-
able. if not essential. to correct the excesses and faults inherent in capitalism.
particularly the inequalities and injustices. Having said that. I must say that we
must not lose sight of the fact that man is the most diffith animal to manage. if
only because of his desire for change.

JM Is it possible to preserve African culture at a time when television. video-
cassettes and satellites are invading the world?

AHB: Yes. so low; as africa becomes sufficiently well organised to be able to use
those techniques wisely. Not only will it have nothing to fear from its influence
but will even be able to use those techniques to do a better job in gathering and
preserving the values of its thousand-year-old civilisation.

.15: But how shall we prevent the youth. whose heads will be full of imported im-
ames. from thinkiru in terms of norms which are foreign to Africa?

AHB: It is up to the leaders of our countries to take neasures. find aethods and
establish study prograls designed to pronote contacts between the young and the old.
the nodernists and the traditionalists. He aust leave no stone unturned to see that
the for-er maintain those contacts and are nolded in the image of the latter.

You know. when a sheep is in the fold. there is no need to bloat in its place. Hav-

ing greater knowledge of our traditions than the lost qualified foreign Africanists.
we are naturally in better position than they to put the nodern techniques to the
service of the African civilization. Africa aust not be a well which is fed from
the outside but. rather. a well which is fed by its own inner spring.

JA: In terns of civilisation. do you think other countries of the Third World are
better off than our country.’

AHB: Other so-called Third World countries have done a better job preserving their
civilizations because they have been less divided and less ill-treated physically
and econoaically than we have. And particularly, they have been less conditioned
than the Africans. Conditioning is to the spirit of a people what condinsnts are to
cooking. It determines their tastes. ideas and aspirations.

JA: In Africa the coloniser was not content with occupying the land; he went so
far as to confiscate our souls.

AHB: It is true that we Africans have reached the point of losing our traditions.
So that if we now want to develop. we nust begin by renewing our traditions. even if
this neans prunirg certain ones. However, we nust realise that pruning aeans cut-
ting certain branches. not the trunk.

JA: If you were asked to define African civilisation in a few words, what would you
say?

ARE: 1 would define it as being the cannon reality of Africa and not how it ap-
pears to be. No one possesses the entire truth. One has only a smattering of truth.

JA: Do you soaetines think about death?

AHB: At least five tines every day. that is. before and after each of the five pre-
scribed prayers. I never travel without Ia shroud being properly placed at the bot-
toa of w suitcase. For I await death at any nonent. It will not take as by sur-

prise.

JA: Nevertheless. are you afraid of death?
AHB: It is useless to want to turn one’s back on what one cannot avoid. I an not

afraid of death. Moreover. at m age aMuslim can hardly fear anything. except God.
In my opinion, death is not an enemy.

JA: Hhat does death represent for you?

39

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

AHB: Death does not exist in African civilisation. It is perceived as a sinple

change of residence. One leaves one dwelling for another. In African philosophy
death does not censure the soul. even though it censuses the body.

The soul is eternal. Authentic African tradition has it that death is even a for:

of liberation. That is why. uith certain African peoples, death is an occasion for
singing and dancing. not tears. The fate of the child who first sees life is non

serious than that of the person who dies. At his first contact with life, a child

cries. He is not wrote. After all, it is aore painful to live than to die.

[Article by Francois Soudan “Goukouni Against Kodjo'"!

[Text] Where will llissein Sabre stop? In just 2 months,- aince the withdrawal of
Libyan troops fro'. Chad in early November, seven eastern villages, including the im-
portant prefecture of Abeche and the strategic point of Oun Hadjer, have passed under
the control of his Northern Armed Forces [PAN]. And with scarcely any fighting.
liabre, now in control of nore than 300,000 square kilo-etera of acraggy bush country
and sandy trails, is camping at the doorstep of Ati and Mango, the first line of
defense for Ndjanena. It is a sort of playback in reverse of the long march he made
just a year ago when Colonel Qadhdhafi's expeditionary force drove his men to the
Sudan border. Today, the Libyans have returned to their native Jamahiriya. And
llissein Rabre obviously intends' to fill the vacuum.

Up to now “We November cmpaign has always been the sane: a small group of notor-
ized battalions (Toyotas equipped with mini Katyushas and Land Rovers armed with
75-m cannon) comprising the bulk of Eabre's "intervention force" have laid siege
to each in turn of the eastern villages once the garrisons had departed. The fall
of Abeche on 19 November was particularly significant: two mortar shells fired on
the airport by the men of "Comnmdant" Abdel Assoul were enough to take this city
of 30,000 inhabitants without a shot fired. Since then, Rabre has set up his com-
mand post there in a spacious villa, abandoning his general headquarters at Kolbus.
The first coluans of refugees from El-Geneina soon arrived in Sudan.

Only two major skirmishes narred PAN's westward progress: between Biltine and Anzoer,
in early Novenber, and at Kotoro-Palata not far from Oum Iladjer in early December:
the FAN offensive. under the mud of the new chief of staff, Gouara Lassou (his
predecessor, 'l‘aer Guenassou, is now a political comissar), has up to now gotten no
further than the edges of the lowlands that descend to the capital, no further than
the fates of Ati and Mango, where since 8 December elements of the neutral "Eastern
zone" OAU [Organization of African Unity] forces have been stationed. It is true
that there is very little to oppose it. The weight of the fighting has been sustain-
ed by the troops of foreign affairs minister Acyl Ahmat, which rapidly dispersed be-
fore an adversary whose training, level of motivation and arms as well (since the
fall of Abeche and the impressive arsenal that was strangely left behind by the Lib-
yans) were superior.

The Integrated National Army, or ANI, theoretically includes all the Chadian factions
opposed to Hissein Habre and should be engaging it on the ground. But militarily it
does not yet exist: heterogeneous, poorly armed, it has only one leader, Lieutenant
Colonel N'colobaye Allafi, and a few hundred men. Finally-—and this not an unimpor-
tant detail, though it has been kept from most observers--the PAN has some impressive
communications equipment given to it in 1979 by french officers when they departed
from Ndjamena. This equipment enabled them, up to last November, to monitor the
radio communications of Libyan troops and pass the information to French military

' intelligence...

So it is hard to see why Hissein Habre would quit when he has so much going for him.
After all, he had been the leading figure in the enemy coalition throughout 1980 un-
til the Libyan contingent came to President Goukouni's aid. And it is no secret that
within the Transitional National Unity Government (GUNT) there is occasional discord,
as shown by the November confrontations between supporters of Hamsmat Abba Said (min-
ister of the interior) and supporters of Acyl Ahmat, not to mention the obvious aver-
sion of Colonel Kamougue (who heads the most disciplined force in the coalition) to
participating in the fighting in the east.

In reality, the new situation created by the arrival of the OAU peace force on 15
November and its subsequent deployment has completely dictated Hissein Babre's strat-
egy: occupy the most terrain possible, taking advantage of the vacuum left by the
Libyan withdrawal, but avoid any contact with the interafrican contingent. The objec-
tive: regain control of the regions formerly under his control, and force the GAO

to see that there can be no "solution" to the Chadian problem without him. In carry-
ing this out, PAN's forces have acted with considerable skill, going clearly on the
offensive while at the same time maintaining from the start that they were prepared

to work with the interafrican troops under Nigerian General Geoffrey Bjiga.

So one can understand the anxiety and nervousness shown by Goukouni Oueddei who, in
the face of the danger Babre increasingly poses, has moved from vague warnings to
leveling concrete threats. Aware of the ineffectiveness of the ANI and averse to
seeing Acyl Ahmat assume the role of de facto military leader of the GUNT, the Chad-
ian president has been-appealing to the can with ever greater frequency since early
December. His approach has been to make a very subtle and self-serving distinction.
According to Goukouni, the peace force is above all a force for preserving order;
thus it must combat disorder, i.e. Hissein Habre. On 20 December, in Libreville,
Goukouni was even more direct: "The Chadian Government believes it is now pointless
to maintain and keep such a force within its borders, since it is doing nothing to
safeguard Chad's security and integrity." And one hears muttering within the head
of state's camp that their Libyan "big brother" had a less squeamish view of its
role and it might unfortunately be necessary to call on him again...

Now it is just this threat of "Libyanization" of the OAU contingent that its leaders,
starting with Eden Kodjo, want above all to avoid: they especially want to aVoid
getting mired in a counter-guerrilla conflict which (according to Colonel Qadhdhafi
himself) cost the Libyan army more than 300 lives even though its armament and espe-
cially its air cover were infinitely greater than those enjoyed by the Zairians,
Nigerians and Senegalese in the DAB force. In the view of the authorities in the
panafrican organization, if a town must be "recaptured"--as is the case, for example,
with Abeche--it is solely the ANI's responsibility: Chad's affair, so to speak.

The OAU force comes in only later, to keep the peace that has already been establish-
ed.

This position is the outcome of a diplomatic balancing act, but it does have the vir-
tue of pointing the finger at the real problem in Chad, the problem of reconciliation.
It is a balancing act because everyone from Addie to Ndjamena knows that at least for
the moment there is no ANI, and so it is incapable of retaking any positions at all.
And even if it seems drole to watch Goukouni Oueddei, who not too long ago was claim-
ing his men would riddle Habre's with Kalashnikova, now confessing his military im-
potence to obtain the operational participation of the 0A0 troops, one can well under-
stand that he night have some good reasons to be bitter.

Perhaps, in fact, he had been promised too much, led to expect too much, in September
and October, when pressure was being put on him to demand the complete withdrawal of
the Libyan expeditionary corps: "In exchange for this courageous act, Goukouni ob-
tained assurances that he would not have to face Habre alone," said one of Goukouni's
confidants in Paris recently. "Now look: everyone washes his hands of it and tells
him he must himself take full responsibility for that decision; in my opinion, that
is an irresponsible attitude."

And in private, at the Paris meeting where they were "playing the OAU game," the
Chadian president was described as unusually violent.

However, the position taken by Eden Kodjo and the OAU contingent which he commands is
perfectly logical from a juridical point of view; except for Korea, no international
force has actually ever fought on the ground--except to defend itself—-against exter-
nal aggression, or, consequently, against internal dissidence. This is true in the
present case of the United Nations troops in Lebanon who do not intervene either
against the Israeli incursions or against Major Haddad's rebellion. And this is in
fact what distinguishes, both formally and practically, an expeditionary type force
(for example. the French in Shaba. the Cubans in Angola, or...the Libyans in Chad)
from a peace force. In addition, the conflict--perhaps a temporary one--between the
OAU and President Goukouni shows. if there were any further need of proof, that no
unilateral solution that excludes one of the constituent elements of the political
life of the state can be permanently imposed on a country. Today, whether one likes
it or not, that element is Hissein Habre, as during the Halloum era it was Goukouni
0ueddei...So what is needed is reconciliation. Unless that word has disappeared from
the Chadian vocabulary...

BRITISH, ALGERIA“ AID--The London-based Overseas Developsent Administration
announced on 8 January that on the following day it would be airlifting to Chad 35
tons of powdered milk to be distributed by the Red Cross to children under the age
of 6 suffering from malnutrition. It also offered trucks to distribute that aid
valued at $58,000. On the other hand, the Algerian daily EL MOUDJABID announced

on 7 January that large quantities of rolling stock, food and drugs were being
transported every day from Algeria to Chad by Algerian military transport planes.
According to Chadian officials, quoted by the Algerian newspaper's special corres-
pondent in Ndjamena, "Algeria was the only country which, in December 1981, had
fulfilled all its commitments to Chad." Bo Passiri, Chadian secretary of state for
foreign affairs and cooperation-who had presided over the first meeting, held in
Algiers, of the Algerian-Chadian Joint Cooperation Canaission created by a decision
made during President Goukouni Heddei's visit to Algiers in 0ctober--came to Algiers
recently to ask President Chadli Bendjedid for Algerian help in the reconstruction
of Chad. According to EL MOUDJAHID, many Chadians are currently undergoing train-
ing in various Algerian institutions and centers and more trainees are expected

in coming months. [Text] [Paris MARCBES TROPICAUX ET MEDITERRANBENS in Preach

COOPERAIION WITH INDIA-In the industrial sphere, the Ivory Coast prefers to
seek assistance from countries such as India rather than from Western countries,
whose aid is considered to be more costly, said Ivorian Minister of Commerce
Amoakon'Thiemele on 17 December, during his official visit to India. A. B.
Thiemele, who met with representatives of the Association of Indian Equipment
Industry (AIBI), suggested that India build in his country a "pilot village"
with craft industries to allow all African nations to judge their potential.

He also called on Indian businessmen to build four sugar cane refineries in

the Ivory Coast. Finally, the Ivorian minister said that talks will soon start
in Abidjan to hammer out the first trade agreement between the two countries.

OIL PALH--The Ivory Coast wants to prevent a decline in the production of its
oil palm plantations. forecast for 1987, by renovating the groves. Oil palm
trees new cover 102,000 hectares, of which 64,000 hectares are in industrial
plantations and 38.000 hectares are in village plantations. The success of the
various "palm" plans up to now has made it possible for the Ivory Coast to
become the third largest producer of paln oil in the world, after Malaysia and
Indonesia, and the second African producer of paln kernels after Nigeria.

Since 1974, annual production has reached between 700,000 and 900,000 tons

(the 700,000 tons arriving in the plants in 1980 will yield over 150,000 tons
of oil). According to the experts, the production figure could be 1 million
tons by 1984-1985, after which it could start declining very rapidly because
more than 55 percent of the groves will have grown too old. That is why the
Ministry of Agriculture has drawn up a timetable to plant new trees in an area
of 112,000 hectares, and extend over a 20-year period, with the replanting

done at the rate of 5,600 hectares a year. [Text] [Paris HARCHES TROPICAUM

NATIONAL POPULAR ASSEMBLY ADOPTS NIH 5-YEAR PLAN
Paris HARCHBS TROPICAUX ET HBDITBRRANEIHS in French No 188‘, 18 Dec 81 p 3380

[Text] The National Popular Assembly of Madagascar [ANP], after considering

and passing the 1982 finance bill on 6 December (see HTH of 11 December, p 3319),
began consideration of another essential economic item: the second 5-year plan,
covering the years 1982-1987. That plan is supposed to reflect in concrete
terms the directions set forth by public law 77-002 on "socialist planning."
According to that law, the structural and material foundation for socialist
development during the current period is to be built around concrete action

in five major sectors:

--In the agricultural sector, development of the productive forces that will
assure the peasants a higher standing of living, through agrarian revolution,
expanding the surface area under cultivation, creation of socialist cooperatives
and state farms, and improvement of techniques.

--In the industrial sector, this period will see the establishment of basic
industry (including aining and energy), which means production of raw materials
and intermediate goods, and will also see expansion of the food processing in-l
dustries, in the producing regions themselves wherever possible.

-—In the service sector, socialist control and rationalization of foreign trade
must be pursued; socialist control and rationalization of internal collection
and distribution should be extended; measures to provide increasing socialist
control over internal transport will be taken; the banking system will continue
to be extended. as much as possible. all the way to the level of the firaisaar
pokontany and access to loans for productive activity will be facilitated.

--From the point of view of infrastructure: existing infrastructure will be
rehabilitated, better maintained and better utilized; the effort to complete
the principal basic networks of intreregional and interregionsl communications
and telecommunications will be given increasing emphasis.

--Fron the point of view of social improvements: an effective policy of fighting

unemployment will be pursued; the work of establishing a basic social infra-
structure will be completed, especially in basic education, health and culture;

the effort to build and rationalize mass communications facilities will be con-
tinued; the standard of living of the soot disadvantaged strata of the populace

will be significantly improved; in particular, state insurance will be extended
and an adequate housing policy inplementsd.

The 1982-87 Plan. which the deputies adopted on 10 December in the forn of

public law no. 81-036, has not yet been made public. It is a voluminous work.
comprised of 15 chapters dealing with najor directions; with agriculture (training,
inprovenent of yields--2.13 tons of rice per hectare. for example, as compared

to the current level of 1.9 tons), with industry (creation of medium-sized indus-
tries to process food products at the production site). with nines (mining of the

coal at Sakoa), with energy (building of dams). social improve-eats, means of
communication, and so on.

DETAILS OF RATSIEAKA'S NEH YEAR'S SPEECH GIVEN
Paris MARCHES TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANEENS in French No 1888, 15 Jan 82 p 156

{Text} In our issue of 8 January (page 96), we gave a very brief emery of
President Ratsiraka's declaration on the occasion of the New Year. Since that

time, we have received the text of that important declaration which merits
review in greater detail.

President Ratsiraka insisted that besides saae aistakes and blunders coamitted

in, the management of the economy, one cannot ignore the fact that the current
problems are the result of:

l. the international econouc crisis which has brought about constant increases

in the cost of imported goods while, paradoxically, the prices of exported com-
modities fluctuate or decline;

2. the increase of interest rates on loans;

3. the heavy expenditures in the social sector, namely, education, health and
higher salaries for civil servants;

a. the natural disasters such as drought which have seriously affect the crops;
5. the problems of foreign exchange.

In his straightforward and courageous declaration, President Ratsiraka did not
conceal the fact that embezzlement of public funds, corruption and the selfish

attitude of some people have aasmaed serious proportions.

The only way to solve the problems, the only truap card for Madagascar, the head of
state concluded, is to put into action the "revolutionary slogan" of "all-out
production." The government, for its part, will assume its responsibilities in
all spheres, be it economic. financial, social or cultural.... Details of the

goverment action will be announced by the president of the Republic at a later
date.

[Text] The faritany (province) of Pianarantsoa is still scarcely developed
from the industrial standpoint: coffee merchandising. rice farming, the nest
industry at the Vohimasina State Farm (m. fornerly nochefortaise), somuc
(Partnership Fievet Ramon and Co) and the Lachaiae Company in Anbohimahasoa;
a tea factory in Sahambavy .with an annual capacity of 200 tons; a rubber-
processing plant, the smc [Malagasy Rubber Processing Comany] and so on.

Yet the industrial potential of the region is real, MADAGASCAR-MIN points
out in a supplement devoted to the province of Pianarantsoa. This province
has mining resources which have been the subject of preliminary studies: the
iron ore deposits of Bekisopa (70 nillion tons, with 68 percent iron content)
and of Fasintsara (105 million tons, with 33 percent iron content); the bauxite
deposits in Sandravinany (also 105 nillion tons. with 60 percent content)....

In another sphere, there is the SOPRAEX [expansion unknown] project to build
a factory to process medicinal plants, now waiting to be implemented following
ratification of a financing agreement between the Malagasy Govern-eat and the
Italian conpany Inverni Belfa on 16 Decenber 1980; Madagascar (mu [National
Bank for Industrial Developnent], My Havana) holds 16-percent interest in
SOPRAEX, and realization of this project is expected to create 200 jobs.

Other projects under planning are: the paper-paste plant of Haute Hatsiatra;
a coffee-meeting plant in Hananjary; a tannery in Ambusitra. Preliminary
feasibility studies have been done or are in progress for projects involving
an oil nill in Anbalavao, a coffee factory in Hanakara, a sugar refinery in
Vangaindrano, a plant to produce alcohol fro. cassava in Ifanadiana.. ..

To this list we could add a factory for Iaking electricity poles in Ambalananakana,
and the CODAL (Industrial Agency of Food Products) fruit juice plant.

CCCB AID T0 RBFLOAT COMPANIES REPORTED
Paris MARCHES TROPICAUX ET MEDITERRANBENS in French No 1885, 25 Dec 81 p 3hhk

[Text] According to the terms of two agreements signed in Antananarivo on

11 December, the Central Fund for Economic Cooperation (CCCB, a French agency)
will extend to Madagascar a loan of 2.5 billion Malagasy francs as urgent aid.
This loan is repayable in 15 years, including a 5-year deferred-payment period,
and carries an annual interest rate of 5.5 percent. The first agreement deals
with the CCCE loan itself, while the second covers the transfer of the loan
to four companies: SOLIMA [Malagasy Petroleum Company] (petroleum). PAPMAD
(Malagasy Paper Company) and SNBCB (Nossi-Be East Coast Sugar Refineries).

The loan will be divided as follows (in Malagasy francs): 880 million for
SOLIMA (Toamasina refinery); 320 aillion for PAPMAD (Ambohiaanambola plant);
985 aillion for SIRAMA [Malagasy Sugar Company]; and 295 million for SNBCB,
The Ioney will be used to purchase raw asterials and spare parts now in short
supply in moat.Malagasy enterprises due to the lack of foreign exchange.

The director of the Central Bank of Madagascar, Mr Bridier, noted that after
this new loan, the total amount of aid granted in 1981 by the CCC! to the

Great Island is 11 billion Malagasy francs. compared to 6 billion in 1980.

This is in addition to assistance provided by the Aid and Cooperation Func
(PAC) in the form of nonrepayable grants, which totaled more than 2 billion
Malagasy francs for 1980. To this direct French aid must be added the coverage
provided by the COFACE [French Insurance Company for Foreign Trade] for French
exports to Madagascar to the tune of about 10 billion Malagasy francs.

French-Malagasy cooperation is doing well and, as pointed out by the governor
of the Central Bank of Madagascar, Leon Rajaobelina. when the two agreements
were signed, this cooperation increased even more after President Ratsiraka's
working visit to Paris last October, Rajaobelina also mentioned another indirect
method by which the French Government helps the Malagasy economy, which in
recent months was illustrated by the easing of the burden of Madagascar's

debt to France and to the Paris Club. Repayment of part of the public debt

to France is spread over a fairly long period.

FAO RESEARCH VBSSEL--The research vessel Jurong which the PAO has put at the
disposal of Madagascar for a 2-year period, arrived in Toanasina in December.
The Jurong, with its hams port in Nossi-Bc, is a 35-meter lung vessel outfitted
wi:h the most modern equipment to detect fishing banks, to catch, refrigerate
and freeze the catches. Its mission is to pinpoint the fish-bearing areas off
the coast of Grande-Ile, to explore the northwest coastal waters from Hahajanga
to Nosei-Be, the Cape d'Ambre area, the Antongil Bay, the Nossi-Be Continental
Shelf tone and, finally, the Toamasina area. The studies already nade indicate,
among other things, that the Antangil Bay is rich in sardines and anchovies.
when the 2-year contract expires. Madagascar will have the choice of either
renegotiating the contract, keeping the vessel or returning it to the FAO.

BCEAO ISSUES REPORI ON RECENT FACTORS IN ECONOMIC SITUAIION
Paris HARCEBS TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANEENS in French No 1888, 15 Jan 82 p 160

[Text] One of the most recent economic and monetary statistics reports of the
Central Bank of the Rest African States (BCEAO) was devoted to Niger.

During the 1980-81 agricultural year. the main crops produced were: 1,567 tons of
shelled peanuts (down by 607 tons compared to the previous year) and 2,852 tons of
cottonseed (down by 576 tons). The 1980 harvest of food crops (millet, sorghum
and beans) totaled 129,000 tons with an overall value of 5.6 billion C?A francs.
At the beginning of the 1980-81 season, the prices which the farmers received for
their millet and sorghum were increased from 40 to 50 CPA francs per kilo.

In the first 6 months of 1981. 2,309 tons of uranium ore were mined (up by 220 tons
compared to the same 6-month period of 1980).

During the first 5 months of 1981, 2,193 commercial flights and 39,067 passengers
arrived and departed from Niamey International Airport. During that same 5-month
period. the Joint Benin-Niger Railroad and Transport Organization (OCBN) carried,
among other goods, 36,520 tons of fuel and 21,805 tons of grain on the way to Niger
and 2,977 tons of merchandise out of Niger. '

By the end of August 1981, the general consumer price index for an African house-
hold was 403.9 compared to 283 at the end of June 1980 (on the basis of the figure

100 established for 1970); the sharp increase registered in the index figure was
mainly due to food prices.

The budget for the October 1980-September 1981 fiscal period was set. both for
revenues and expenditures. at 80.6 billion CPA francs (an 8.5 billion increase
compared to the previous budget) and included 8.7 billion for the public debt
burden (up by 6.5 billion) and 26 billion for capital expenditures (unchanged).

By the end of July 1981, receipts from custom duties and taxes totaled 17.7 billion
CPA francs. 86 percent of which came from imports.

By the end of December 1980, Niger had an outstanding externaldebt equivalent to
86.4 billion CPA francs (up by 31.6 billion compared to the figure for end of
1979) with an available margin of 90.1 billion not yet withdrawn (up by 37 billion).

On 30 June 1981, the amount of money in circulation (bills and coins) was 32.7

billion CPA francs (up by 3.5 billion compared to end of June 1980). The value
of demand and time deposits in banks and savings accounts was 56.1 billion CPA

francs (down by 10.2 billion).

On that same date, the total amount of aid to the economy was 91.2 billion CPA
francs (up by 1.2 billion compared to June 1980). Almost 66 percent had gone to
the private sector (mostly the trade sector) while public enterprises accounted
for close to 39 percent of the total.

Over the 12-month period, the domestic net balance position of the Nigerian Trea-
sury had greatly imporved moving from a deficit of 12.9 billion CPA francs in
June to a surplus of 0.1 billion by the end of June 1981.

The situation with regard to net external assets (Central Bank and commercial
banks) had followed the opposite trend moving from a credit balance for the equi-
valent of 3 billion CPA francs in June 1980 to a debit balance of 1.8 billion CPA
francs because the banks were forced to turn to foreign credit to finance their
assistance to the economy.

BRIEFS

FRENCH CONSULATE IN ARLIT-—Since 11 January there has been a French Consulate in
the town of Arlit (population: around 20,000), a Saharian subprefecture in the
department of Agadez and the chief uranium town of Niger. This consulate was
opened because there is a large community of French technicians accompanied by
their families (around 1.200 people) who work in that mining and industrial "heart"
of Niger. said Alain Pierret, the French ambassador to Niger. It is also justified
by the number of French tourists who travel down the Algiers-Asadez trans-Sahara
highway (which passes through Arlit). For instance, during the Christmas holidays,
as many as 50 passenger cars crossed the border between Algeria and Niger every
day and more than half of these cars were driven by French nationals. [Text]

"shehu shaped: A Man of vision Speaks Out“!

NlGERlA'S PRESIDENT Shehu Shagari This collection in a single volume makes

has already established himself as a
world statesman. This book is a unique
collection of the Nigerian President's
speeches during various stages of his
leadership - from the date when power
was transferred from Nigeria's military
rulers to the civilian government led by
Alhayi Shageri. to topics on ﬁnance.
Nigeria's role in Africa's unity. industry.
politics. the press and religion.

In this selection. President Shageri
preaches peace and understanding not
only in Nigeria but universally. It also
becomes clear that the Nigerian leader’s
hopes and aspirations concerning
Nigeria have been established beyond
doubt through his attitude. his strategy
and his utterances both in private and
public.

Aminu Tiijani. one of the editors says:
"I strongly believe that the 'Shagari vie.
ion of Nigeria' will one day develop into
an international slogan {or peace and
prosperity {or all mankind"

Tijiani goes on to say: “One of the ﬁrst
things i observed about Shehu Shegari is
that the intimately solemn and serious
expression he wears hides a very strong
but ﬂexible mind: a mind full of positive
and honest hopes about mankind gener-
ally."

David Williams. an English journalist.
is the oo-editor of this book. His intimate
knowledge of West Africa. through his
editorship - 1‘ West Africa magazine. l‘ully
qualiﬁes him to join Tiﬁenl in writing
this book.

Many of the speeches in the book have
been reproduced by Nigeria's mass media
and quoted in many parts of the world.

it an easy reference book for anyone
interested in Nigeria or Nigerian affairs.

What makes this hook much more
interesting is that. the speeches by Presi-
dent Shagari give a unique insight into
the character of this teacher-turned.
President For instance. notes Mr‘l‘ijiani:
"Shagari is a man who. though very
serious-minded and serious-looking. has
the most tantalising sense of humour.
His jokes, which he cracks mostly with a
small group or with individuals. are told
in the most simple but funny way. To
those who may be hearing hint make a

jolte for the ﬁrst time it always sounds

funnier. perhaps because most people
hardly expect such a serious-minded per.
son to oondeacend to do so." -

Although the selection from the Presi-
dent's speeches and writings covers only
the first 18 months of his four-year term
of ofﬁce. they also look far ﬁorward - to
what has been termed Shagari's vision
of Nigeria. The two authors should be
encouraged to write a second volume of
President Shegari's speeches when he
completes his ﬁrst four years in olilce.
They will have plenty to write about the
achievements of one of Nigeria's illustri-
ous sons - Alhnii Shehu Shegari.

This hoolt will ﬁnd a ready market not
only in Nigeria but also in research
libraries allover the world where Presi-
dent Shageri's Nigeria is already becom-
ing a household name. Anyone interested
in Nigeria should read this hook

[Interview with Alhaji shahu Await, Nigerian High emissions: in tandem by Bathe:
Ogunnodede: date and place not given]

[Text]

AFRICA IS THE centrepiece and corner-
stone of Nigeria‘s foreign policy.
Nigerians have seized every opportunity
around the world to state this. said
Nigeria's new High Commissioner in
London. Alhaji Shehu Await, recently.
Nigerians think that the world. the
West in particular. is either not listening
or has misunderstood its foreign policy;
or at best supposes that Nigeria is
engaged in a strategy of all talk and no
action. So Alhaii Shehu was at pains to
enumerate instances of action by Nigeria
in support of what has now become the
most important phase of its foreign pol-
Icy.

Why. of all the other pressing matters
that trouble the world - the threat of
nuclear war for instance - is Nigeria
harping on Africa? Alhttii Sheba gave the
answer: "Nigeria neither has. nor wants.
global responsibility. but prefers to play
Its part in its geographical sphere." That
is not to say that Nigeria has ignored the
rest of the world. Indeed sayt. Alhaji
Shehu. Nigeria is an active member of
the Commonwealth. the United Nations
and the Non-Aligned Movements.

Africa has been the main concern of
successive Nigerian governments since
the country became independent
l-ecuuse. Mild Alhayi Shehu. quoting
Nigeria's Vice-President. Dr Alex
Eltwueme. " . . . so long as the blackman
in South Africa is not free. we could not
regard ourselves as being free. So long as
our brothers in South Africa are still
being trampled upon because of the col-

65

our of their skin. so long will those of us
who share that trait with them suffer
that indignity."

"But that is not all" added Alhaji
Shehu. “Our interest in African affairs
has been guided by the traditional con-
captofprotacting and promoting our vital
national interests. the most important of
which are to create conditions at home
and abroad and around us conducive to
political stability."

So eager have Nigerians been to
promote their concept of ‘Africa ﬁrst'
that they have used economic muncle to
ram home their points. expecially
against the West. which the Nigerians
are convinced. are in collusion with
South Africa to maintain the status quo.

TRADE IMHALANCB RITE FRANCE REIUCBD FROM 1980 FIGURES
Paris HARCHES TROPICADX ET NEIITERRANBBNS in French No 1886 1 Jan 82 p 30

[Text] Trade between Nigeria and France, which was worth 8,903,000,000 francs in
the first half of 1981, as opposed to 8.77 billion francs during the first half
of-l980 (HTH 2 Oct p 2505), rose to 12,605,600,000 francs for the first 9 months of
1981, about the ease as during the sane period in 1980. There was a large gap
between exports and imports in 1980 in favor of Nigeria; however, this gap dinin-
ished considerably during the first half of 1981 and was reduced still further
over the 9-month period. During this time the reserve ratio was 95.b percent for
France, whereas for the same 9dnonth period in 1980 it was 44.7 percent.

Between the two [9Hnonth] periods, France's sales rose frol 3,963,300,000 francs
to 6,153,500,000 francs (up 55.3 percent), while Nigeria's 8,200,600,000 francs in
sales fell to 6,652,100,000 francs (down 27.1 percent). Thus, the deficit in the
balance of trade, which was 0,238,300,000 francs for France during the 9-month
period in 1980, fell to only 298.6 million during the sale 9—month period in 1981.

This represents a drop of 92 percent.

This favorable situation for France is the consequence of the many contracts that
France has concluded, increasing its sales of naterial and equipment. It is also
due to a sizable reduction in its purchases of oil.

The provisions of the new Nigerian budget, which comes into force on 1 January,
are designed to reduce imports into Nigeria and will certainly result in a reduc-
tion in France's as well as other countries' sales; for our country, this could
lead to a new imbalance in trade to our disadvantage in 1982. In London business
circles, the feeling is that Great Britain's sales will be reduced to about 1.2
billion pounds this year because of these provisions. But it is also true that
the balance of trade between Nigeria and Great Britain has so far always been con-
siderably in favor of Great Britain, and to an extent that has often been cause
for concern among Nigerians, who are more than ever desirous of establishing
balanced relations will all of their trading partners (in this connection, see the
recent statement by the minister of foreign trade in HTM of 20 November, p 2949).

CONTRACTS SIGNED FOR EXTENSIVE MAPPING PROGRAM
Paris HARCHES TROPICAUX ET MEDITERRANEENS in French No 1886, 1 Jan 82 p 30

[Text] The Federal Government of Nigeria has embarked upon a vast mapping program
and to this end has signed two series of contracts worth 39,352,480 nairas with
specialized firms.

The first series of contracts is for the production of 1:25,000 naps to replace
the old 1:50.000 maps, which were too small to be useful in economic planning pro-
jects. Five firms have been chosen, each for a specific sector. Their contracts
add up to 14,028,480 nairas; a surface area of 69,230 square kilometers [will be
covered].

Map Data Services: Sokoto region; cost: 2,660,882 nairas; time: 18 months.
Ertec West Africa: Kano region; cost: 3,454,416 nairas; time: 24 months.

A. A. Laksnu and Co/Gulf Consultants: Ijebu-Ode Bpe region; cost: 2,260,612
nairas; time: 18 months.

Allied Surveys: Kainji/Borgu region; cost: 3,289,874 nairas; time: 24 months.
Pan African Surveys: Abeokuta region; cost: 2,362,694.nairas; time: 18 months.

The second series of contracts is for maps of six state capitals, with a 1:1,000
scale. These contracts amount to 25,324,000 nairas. The cities to be mapped are
Akure, Bauchi, Ilorin (zones A and B), Minna, Overri, and Sokoto. The firms these
contracts were awarded to were not named, but we recall that for 0werri-the
capital of the state of Imo-the firm Dans Surveys and Consultants of the consor-

tium Dana and Setam Associates was designated. Its contract, signed on 4 December,
amounts to 4.4 million nairas, and the work is to be carried out over the next 24
months (HT! 18 Dec p 3370).

The country remains an importer

apart from volume - has been in the
nature of the raw materials exported: oil

Overwhelmingly Nigeria's trade

FEASIBILITY STUDY CONDUCTED ON IRON ORE DEPOSITS
Paris MARCHES TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANBENS in French No 1888, 15 Jan 82 pp 135. 136

[Excerpts] The Eastern Senegal Iron Ore Mining Company (HIPRSO), created to ex-
ploit the mineral deposits discovered near the Paleme River, is a nixed economy
company with a capital of 180.6 million CPA francs.

According to a recent report. the discovery in 1979 of large quantities of oxidized
ores is what has created renewed interest in this project (see moans TROPICAUX
E‘l‘ NEITERRANEBNS of 1 August 1980, page 1915) which until then was based on the
mining of magnetic ores which are less interesting because they require the build-
ing of a costly treatment plant where the ore is turned into pig iron before it
can be marketed.

Ore reserves are estimated to be 216.7 million tons in the Koudekourou location,
55 million tons in the Karakaene location and 1.0 million tons in the Kouroudiako
location. or a total of 311.7 million tons of ore with about 60 percent iron content.

The reserves of magnetic ores could be exploited later when the cost of building
a port and a railroad has been covered. Reserves of these ores are estimated to
amount to 126.9 million tons in Farsngalia and 59.7 million tons in Cote, or a
total of 186.6 million tons.

The mines are expected to yield 12 million tons of oxidized ore a year for, at
least, 23 years. Mining the magnetic ores will prolong the lifespan of the mine.

The existence of all these reserves was established after conducting extensive
boring explorations as well as chalical and mineralogical analyses; the deposits
have also been the subject of a certification study and the French company SOCOMINE
{expansion unknown] has conducted a preliminary feasibility study on the project.

A fully funded feasibility study on the railroad and port facilities is now being
done by a group headed by the Central Office for Overseas Equipment with funding
provided by the French Aid and Cooperation Fund (FAC) while the German Krupp Com-
pany is conducting the mining engineering studies financed by the Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau [Reconstruction and Credit Bank] (KfH).

Not counting the above-mentioned studies on railroad and port facilities, 2.48
billion CPA francs have been spent so far on topographic and laboratory work, on
testing and on pilot plants with funding provided by the state of Senegal, the
French Republic. the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Economic Commun-
ity (see MARCHES TROPICAUX ET HEDITERRANBENS on 25 December 1981 p 3525).

Since the deposits are located several hundred kilometers from the sea, the most
difficult problem being faced is how to transport the mined ore. There are several
alternatives. The feasibility study will examine each of them.

The total investment required for the project is estimated to be $900 million, at
their end of 1979 value, divided into mining costs ($250 million), railroad costs
($500 million) and port costs ($150 million).

The personnel required for the mining operations will be 1,670 people of which 30
will be in managerial level positions, 538 as supervisors and 1,102 workers.

Several alternatives are being considered for the railroad line: to build a metric
and normal-gauge track capable of carrying 18,000-ton trains from the mine to the
location selected for the port terminal; to use the existing railroad track of the
Senegalese Railroad Administration after renovating it; or to go through the port
of Bubs in Guinea-Bissau. All these alternaitves will be examined in the feasi-
bility study.

The railroad operations of MIFERSO will employ a staff of 1,335 of which 25 will be
in managerial positions, 380 as supervisors and 930 workers and laborers.

There are three possible locations for the port terminal: in the port of Dakar,
in Port Sedar (Hboro) or in Bargny.

The port terminal, where 175,000-ton ore tankers will be docking. must be able to
accommodate vessels drawing at least 20 meters of water. To draw 20 meters of
water, the wharf must be 1.8 kilometers long in Port Sedar and 4 kilometers long
in Bargny while in Dakar it will have to be extended to the level of Coree Island.

The feasibility study will, therefore, try to determine the factors which will help
to make the best selection. Port operations will require 311 people—-6 in manager-
ial positions, 88 supervisors and 217 workers.

The feasibility study will be ready at the beginning of 1983. Next comes the imple-
mentation stage and, if financing is obtained, this will last 3 years. The ore
should start reaching the market in 5 years' time. In the opinion of the experts,
this will be around the time when the world steel industry will start increasing

its demand for iron ore.

Consequently, this project is of paramount importance for Senegal since it will
create 3,316 jobs directly connected with the project; it will have an annual turn-
over of more than 50 billion CPA francs which will greatly improve Senegal's
balance of payments, will bring in revenues from duties and taxes and will have
side effects the importance of which cannot be fully assessed at this stage.
