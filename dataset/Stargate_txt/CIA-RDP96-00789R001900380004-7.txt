The building at coordinates_is large, wide
and has several levels. Throug t e nort side of the

building, a form of energy flows out, or in, along a linear
path. At the end of this path, some distance from the
building, is a structure where the energy takes on a fan-shaped
pattern.

A similiar linear flow passes through the south side of
the building. This path terminates at a housed, metal
structure where the energy weakens or dissipates in a manner
unlike that to the north (NFI).

These energy 'lines' are connected to monitoring equipment
at two separate points within the building. The equipment has
glass panels, dials and bright yellow and/or white lights.
There are levers on the walls nearby and separate (control)
booths. Both lines of energy, (N and S), are linked together
in some way within the building by yet a different kind of
energy (NFI).

Another form of energy goes up and back down through the
top of the building. It takes the form of a powerful beam with
a feeling like heat. The beam is directed/aimed at a
rectangular shaped device in space. The ratio of the
information passed on this beam is two-thirds up/one-third down.

The 'down link' passes into a round, box-like device and
thence through electron tubes and circuitry to a large
computer. From here data is distributed to smaller,
specialized computers and to printers which produce graphs and
charts with lines, colors, squares and cubes (NFI). Ideas
associated with these things are: global, hemisphere, sorting,
analyzing, boundaries and limits. This operation is entirely
automated, with digits/symbols being passed back and forth from
machine to machine. Humans, (who are mainly technician types
and 'watch officers' on continuous shift work), are not
involved until late in the process.

The overall feel for this building and its mission is
generally one of centralized monitoring, receiving, processing
and data transmission. However, strongly present also are
ideas of: subterfuge, clandestine, disguising, misleading and
cover.

Additional Tasking:

A structure located 245 meters WSW of the building
discussed above was generally described as a low, square,
thick, reinforced building in a 'sensitive area.‘ It was
recognized as an ammo storage area
