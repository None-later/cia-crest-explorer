3 to 8 September 1981. This information is provided as raw
intelligence data, and as such, has not been subjected to any
intermediate analysis, evaluation or collation.

DETAILS:

l. Source 869-01: On or about 7 September l981, a truck or

"jeep type vehicle“ was seen at the bunker in question. Source
could not recall the exact time of day, but had the "impression

of darkness.“...“perhaps early morning or late afternoon." At

this time source saw boxes being loaded onto the "jeep type
vehicle." Source felt that the "jeep type vehicle" may have made
several trips to the bunker in question. 0n 7 September 1981, four
personnel were observed. Three arrived in the truck and the fourth
was already waiting at the bunker. Two of the personnel, one

from the arriving truck and the one who was waiting at the bunker,
appeared “military"(dpess) and seemed “familiar with this place“
(the bunker). Source reported that one of these two individuals
had "some responsibility with the, with this place, this installa-
tion or...this group of...container places.“ Source further
described the truck as "just same size as 3/4 ton" and having a
"white German tag." Source described this tag as being white,
outlined in black with a small square colored "black, red, brown

or red, black brown" in the upper left of the tag. Source recalled

the tag as being numbered 862 or 863 (Incl l).

2. SOURCE 878-0l: Source reported boxes in bunker being moved
and loaded into "a truck or vehicle...looks like a jeep" on
5 Sep 81. Source indicated that four individuals were involved;
at least one was a female. All involved appeared to be "foreign...
Germans."

Source described the present (23 Mar 82) location of the
boxes taken from the bunker. Source reported the boxes to be
stored in "a basement“..."under a two-story house with attic,
red tile roof." Source reported that buildings in this area were
marked in "Arabic numbers, long tails, white, white on blue
background, dark blue, like Navy blue...background is oval."
The house in question was marked 718 or 719 (Incl 2+3).

Source reported possible future use of explosives stolen
from bunker in'Some kind of raid on airbase." Raid is believed
to be scheduled for the period l-5 May 82. Airbase is believed
to be in the same city and within l0 miles of the house mentioned
above. No further information available.

Source beléﬁves that the individuals who stole the explosives
from the bunker did so under contract. The stolen explosives
have now been delivered. Individuals who plan to use the explosives
are not necessarily the same ones who stole them.

in a multi-story building constructed of "yellow stucco on brick.“
This building is located in a "ah, kind of run down industrial
area." Source reported that there were "many buildings alike"

in this area. Source stated that this residence can best be
located by looking for a " 'L' shape beer garden“ which is

nearby. Also, there is reportedly a "railyard of some kind"

very close and "a large open area for, it's like used for carnival

the new city ends and old city, like the suburbs start,“ Also the
house is about a block from a trolly car access..." and "there's
something about a restaurant or a food establishment directly across
from that house." The "food kaserne" has an emblem, "it's red and
it's got a gold, a golden, like it were a golden crown, a golden
thread, round, a red circle...it has particular and peculiar meaning
