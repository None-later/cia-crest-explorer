ABSTRACT

In FY 1986. a joint venture between SRI International and John F. Kennedy University
was begun to examine possible remote action (RA) effects on piezoelectric transducers.
Researchers from John F. Kennedy University recruited. evaluated. and trained participants.

SRI International developed an experimental RA system and prepared a well-characterized
environment for formal experimental sessions.

During the pilot experiment in FY 1986. transducer signals were observed under sufficiently
controlled conditions to warrant continued investigation. After signiﬁcant improvements were
made to the protocol. system hardware and software. and control environments. another
experiment was conducted in FY 1987. This report reviews the 1986 pilot study and details the
elaborate and necessary precautions undertaken during the 1987 study to eliminate or understand
the sources of artifacts. No evidence for RA was observed in the 1987 experiment.

I INTRODUCTION

For over one hundred years. the literature on parapsychology has contained reports
claiming human interactions with physical apparatus by mental means alone.".2-3 in FY 1986
and FY 1987. SR! international and John F. Kennedy University (JFK) conducted two
experiments to investigate these claims. This report reviews the findings of the 1986 pilot
experiment and documents the 1987 experimentf

The most direct way to‘examine this putative phenomenon was to attempt a replication of a
claimed effect. We began the process of selecting a candidate experiment by first reviewing
published laboratory research on remote action (RA)t. placing particular emphasis on recent
work that used modern instrumentation.

RA studies have traditionally been divided into two categories: statistical experiments
(sometimes called micro-RA experiments). in which small effects are observed over many
thousands of samples: and macro-RA experiments. in which large effects are claimed. usually on
the basis of considerably fewer trials. Although the statistical experiments have generally been the
more rigorous in both protocol and hardware design. interpretation of the results is difficult. in
any study in which the test of the null hypothesis is statistical (e.g.. p S 0.05). a causal
relationship is n0t easily determined. As a consequence. we surveyed the literature on
parapsychology for examples of nonstatistical effects in which the experimental protocol also
appeared sufﬁciently rigorous to justify further study.

From our review of the literature. the most promising experiment was work claiming an
interaction with a piezoelectric transducer (PZT).‘ The basis for our selection was threefold: (1)
a nonstatistical effect was claimed (RA signal-to-noise [s/n] ratio of ~ 5:1). (2) effects were
produced with the subject at a distance from the sensor (i.e.. the subject did not touch the
sensor). and (3) a method of subject selection and training was claimed.

According to the published reports. a piezoelectric crystal had been suspended several
meters from the subject. The experimenter reported that several RA agents had. by mental

t in the literature on parapsychology. such effects are usually associated with the term

psychokinesis. However. to be consistent and parallel with remote viewing. we have
adopted the term remote action.

means alone. consistently produced signals that had been at leaSt ﬁve times the background noise
level. Occasionally signals as great as 100 times background had been observed.

We formed a joint venture with JFK to replicate these claims. The principal investigator at
JFK. Dr. Julian lsaacs. and his staff agreed to screen. assess. and train promising RA subjects and
make them available to SR1. SR1 lntemationai retained the task of designing and construcung all
experimental hardware for use both in screening and training at JFK and in trials at SR1.

II THE 1986 PILOT RA EXPERIMENT

In considering the problem of validating (or invalidating) contraversial claims for the
existence of RA. SR1 recognized two distinct but related obstacles: (1) no single experiment. no
matter how impressive the results. can prove or disprove the existence of RA. and (2) no single
initial experiment can eliminate or control all possible sources of artifacts. For a pilot Study.
therefore. we adopted a cost effective and realistic procedure that was technically sound but
somewhat incomplete. This section reviews the FY 1986 pilot experiment--lncluding the event

deﬁnition. experimental protocol. and results. Details of the pilot study can be found in
Reference 5.

A. Event Definition

Other disciplines (e.g., nuclear physics) routinely require an s/n ratio of 6 to 8 Standard
deviations (o) in order to accept the existence of a real event. if we assume in our system 0 was
approximately equal to the noise envelopes. then the s/n ratio for an RA event was 6:1.
Specifically. our event threshold was equal to a system output of 25 millivolts (mV). where the
system noise envelope was approximately 4 mV (full wave rectiﬁed) for a given sensor.

B. Experimental Protocol

Conceptually. the pilot experiment was as follows. Two PZTs (differentially connected)
were electrically. mechanically. and sonically isolated. A participant's task was to effect a change
in the differential signal; such a change was defined as an event. Control runs recorded the PZT
_ outputs in isolation (i.e.. no human observers). We required that the hardware and protocols be
"sufﬁciently rigorous such that the presence of any uncorrelated events would warrant continued
investigations. Our null hypothesis was that no uncorrelated events should be detected. Known
sources that could influence the PZT. resulting in artifacts. were minimized, controlled. or

monitored. Examples of such sources of artifacts and the method of control are shown in Table
1.

C. Results

During September and October 1986 at SR1. five participants contributed a total of twenty
experimental sessions. each lasting about 90 minutes.‘ The participants were recruited by the
staff at JFK. Each participant was asked to influence one of a pair of PZTs operating in
differential mode. so as to produce an event above a predetermined threshold. The last eight
sessions were conducted under the most rigorous condition. in which the sensor enclosure was
located in a locked laboratory adjacent to the room in which the participant was sitting. At that

point. the participant was approximately 3 meters from the sensor pair. although the sensor
enclosure was visible through a double-pane window.

Under those conditions. one participant produced a total of eleven events above the
threshold. which were grouped in three series of four. four. and three events. respectively. Each
group of events lasted approximately 1 second and was distributed in three separate effort periods
over two sessions. with the sessions occurring on different days. The signals were not correlated
with any of the sources of artifact we considered. in approximately 30 hours of control trials that
were conducted under the same circumstances except for the absence of humans. no equivalent
uncorrelated events were recorded. If we take a conservative view that each event series
constituted a single event. then only three events occurred instead of eleven. If we further assume
a Poisson distribution for these events. the probability that no events would be observed in 30

hours of controls is p S 0.01. Many more hours of control with and without participants present
would be required to establish a meaningful baseline.

As indicated ab0ve. known sources of artifacts were considered and controlled.
minimized. or monitored. However. some potential artifact sources such as cosmic rays.
low-frequency magnetic fields. and subaudible acousuc and mechanical resonances below 30
hertz (Hz) were excluded from consideration in this initial series of experiments.

Our conclusion at the end of the pilot study was that the data were sufficiently interesting to
warrant further investigation. The preliminary nature of those pilot sessions cannot be stressed
too strongly. however. especially since all possible sources of artifact were not excluded. We shall

see in Appendix B that an unshielded vibrational resonance at 8 Hz was the most likely source of
the uncorrelated events found in the pilot study.

III THE 1987 RA EXPERIMENT

Encouraged by the results of the pilot study. we improved the pr0tocol in order to conduct

a definitive formal study during 1987. This section describes those improvements and details the
formal experiment.

As in the pilot study. JFK personnel were responsible for the choice of participants. the
means of enhancing and maintaining a minimum magnitude of functioning. and possible future

methods for using psychological profiles as a basis for selecting participants. Their methods and
results are reported in Appendix A.

A. Modifications to the 1986 Experiment

The 1986 pilot study was reviewed by the Scientific Oversight Committee (SOC) appointed
to examine the work of SRl's Cognitive Sciences Program. Based on the review. we developed

the protocol for the 1987 experiment by modifying the protocol for the 1986 experiment. These
modifications are described in the following paragraphs.

1. Separation Between Participants and PZ‘I‘s

The SOC's most salient criticism of the experiment focused on the relative proximity
of participant to sensors and the opportunity thereby afforded for non-RA interactions. We
concluded that the most effective method of meeting this criticism was to conduct all 1987

experimental sessions with the participants and sensors well separated. in the formal trials
conducted at SR1 international facilities. therefore.‘ the PZT enclosure was located in a locked.
sound-attenuating room approximately 15 meters from the participants' area. with two other
rooms in between. The arrangement of rooms. apparatus. and individuals is shown in Figure 1.

To further protect against conscious fraud. the participants were permitted only one
familiarization visit to the sensor room at SR1. At the time of the visit. no experimental sessions
had been scheduled. so the participants were deliberately uninformed of the timing of future
trials. During experimental sessions. the participants were never allowed to enter the sensor

room. Contact with the system was established through the feedback mechanisms described in
Appendix 8.

2. Task Importance

Through discussions between JFK and SRI personnel. we recognized the role that task
importance plays in obtaining maximum effort from the participants. Therefore. we constructed a
sequence of steps in which participating in the SRI study was a goal to be sought by the successful

individuals. An analogy to teaching the ﬁnals in a sporting event might be appropriate. in
addition. visits and discussions with JFK staff sought to define the physical environment and
psychological conditions at SRl that might be most conducive to the participants’ success.

3. The Artifact Boundary

in order to facilitate the design of the PZT system. we found it useful to formulate a
concept we term the “artifact boundary.” In brief. the limits of the artifact boundary were
defined by the-location or characteristics of the most sensitive device or data that we wanted to
protect. By examining each part of the PZT signal transmission system and establishing the

artifact boundary for that component. we identiﬁed artifact-producing influences that had been
overlooked.

in particular. this exercise helped us to recognize that in the 1986 study. even though
the sensors were in a shielded enclosure 2 to 3 meters from the participant. the low-level (i.e..
millivolt) PZT signals were being digitized very near the participant. Because the same signal line
was being used for both participant feedback and the RA data record (computer output). the
possibility existed that apparent RA effects on the PZT could be produced through more normal
interactions with the digitizing and feedback apparatus. Our solution to this problem was to
introduce a parallel set of fiber-optic transmitters in the PZT enclosure. These duplicate signals
were sent directly to an instrumentation-grade tape recorder located in the same room as the
sensors. 15 meters from the participant. By creating a source of redundant data. we could more
easily verify that the proposed RA interaction actually occurred at the sensor location. Prior to
any data collection. all experimental staff at SR] and JFK agreed that the tape-recorded PZT

signals would be the only authoritative data for determining whether any anomalous events
occurred.

4. Physical Security

The sensor box was located in a locked. sound-attenuating room approximately 15
meters from the participants' area. This room was secured by both a combination and cipher lock
and was on SRl's general security system. Door sensors were installed such that the room could
not be opened without alerting a 24-hour SRl security guard. Also. a passive infrared detector
was placed in the room so that any unauthorized intrusion would be immediately detected.

Finally. the facility was examined for signs of tampering by a roving security guard following an
8-hour inspection schedule. The building in which the experiments were conduCted has limited
access. requiring escort [or any nonemployee.

5. Event Definition

The ﬁnal substantive modification to the pilot experimental protocol was the definition
of RA events. The digitized control trials were used to locate a critical voltage output (Vc) which
was defined as the maximum voltage observed in any control trial. excluding voltages correlated to
environmental events. After the effort tapes were digitized. a candidate RA event was one whose
output voltage was at least 1.5 Vc (again. excluding voltages correlated to environmental events).
Provided the system output was well behaved. this definition corresponded to an s/n ratio of
approximately 5 to 6a-roughly equivalent to the signals reported in the parapsychological
literature and within the commonly accepted criteria for a real signal.

B. Design and Construction of the Laboratory Apparatus

This section generally describes the present RA system. although clearly several features
were first designed in 1986 and subsequently modified. A schematic overview of the basic

laboratory RA apparatus is shown in Figure 2. For visual clarity. we have omitted the
environmental monitoring equipment.

The complete description of the hardware design and the artifact protection and syStem

testing can be found in Appendix B. For this report. it suffices to say that extensive artifact
detection and testing were employed in this experiment.

C. Experimental Protocol

1. Hypotheses and Variables

We postulated that selected participants would. in the absence of environmental
interference. be able to modify the normal output of a PZT in a nonstatistical way. Assuming that
a system is well shielded and well characterized. environmental monitoring of the system's
susceptibilities can establish the source of some rare events (e.g.. earthquakes. large AC-power
fluctuations. and the like). Other sources of rare events are not as easily determined. For
example. the fiber-optics transmission line is an electronic system containing components that
may spontaneously emit noise bursts. These bursts can result from such mechanisms as
microplasma discharge due to semiconductor defects. and minority carrier injection from
contacts. Without a way to predict such events. the only method to distinguish candidate RA
signals from noise bursts is through control trials. in the 1987 experiment. by collecting data
when no participants were attempting to influence the PZT (non-effort periods). the frequency of
occurrence and voltage amplitude of noise processes was established. Candidate RA events had

to occur during effort periods and be significantly greater in amplitude than the control trial noise
maximum.

The independent variable in this experiment was time. The dependent variable was
the overall measure of an RA effect. as determined from the differential electrical output of the
PZT. Although the participants were told to focus'their attention on only one sensor. the

experimenters agreed before beginning the experiment to define the RA record as the differential
output. in principle. then. the sensor the participant actually affected would not be critical.

2. Data Collection

A formal data record was defined as a session in which the instrumentation tape
recorder was recording both PZT channels and all environmental monitors. RA trials at SRl were

conducted from May 28. 1987. to July 30. 1987. There were three types of formal data
collection:

0 Global Control Trials - Data collection for many hours when no one was
focusing RA attention on the target element. This technique established the
long-term performance of the system and determined the unperturbed artifact
production rate. In practice the global control trials were conducted on
alternate days from the effort sessions. at the same time of the day. That is. the
usual schedule was to conduct global control trials on Monday. Wednesday. and
Friday. and effort sessions on Tuesday and Thursday. In this way the effort
trials were always bracketed by control trials.

0 Local Control Trials - Data collection just before or just after an experimental
session. with no one focusing attention on the target element. These trials were

Approved For Release 2002111118 : ClA-RDP96-00787R000300300001-7

intended to confirm the proper operation of the system immediately before or
after an RA session. (Since both ordinary scientific experiments and RA
literature contain evidence for “relaxation” or “linger” effects that persist after

an interaction.7 local comrol trials are sometimes separated into pre- and
post-session control trials!)

0 Experimental Trials - Data collection during an RA session when a participant
focused on the target element. Periods of effort were interspersed with rest
periods. Periods of effort in RA sessions were from 5 to 20 minutes long.
ordinarily with no more than three effort periods in a session. The timing and

spacing of RA sessions depended on the participant. The total duration of an
RA session was always about 90 minutes.

Fifty-four formal. tape-recorded RA effort sessions and sixty-three equivalent control
sessions were conducted. A typical experiment proceeded as follows. Before the participant
arrived. the SR] experimenter entered the feedback and sensor room area and checked all
equipment for proper operation. A local control trial was then conducted in order to record the
baseline performance of the system. About 90 minutes later. the JFK experimenter and
participant team arrived. and the experimental session was then carried out as previously
described. During the periods of effort. the participant’s task was to interact mentally with the

PZT to produce an event above a preset feedback threshold. in practice. the participant’s
attention was focused on the audible and visual feedback.

During the period of rest. the participant was asked to direct attention away from the
apparatus and engage in some other activity. Usually the participant and experimenters moved to
the outer part of room 0-304 for the duration of the rest period. At this point in the
development of an RA protocol. however. we could not predict with any confidence the degree of
control participants had over their RA ability. For example. some parapsychological literature
reports that “release of effort” or “unintentional” effects may occur immediately after a period of
effort.‘ We reported all data produced during the entire 90-minute experimental session.
therefore. regardless of whether it was termed “rem" or “effort.” In examining the data we found
no evidence for the possible existence for such effects.

IV RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF THE 1987 EXPERIMENT

A. Primary Data Analysis

From May 28. 1987, to July 30. 1987, six JFK participants (two male and four female)
contributed fifty-four formal RA effort sessions at SR1.

As discussed earlier. the signal of interest was the digitized differential output of the PZTs.
The RA claim was that the signal of interest would be a low-frequency transient in the range of 10
to 1.000 Hz. Nyquist's theorem states that in order to correctly sample a time-varying waveform.
the sampling rate must be at least two times the highest frequency of interest. To meet this
criterion and provide a margin of safety, we selected a S-ltilohertz (kHz) sampling rate. At a
S-kHz rate. digitizing over 100 hours of data presents substantial memory problems (1.8 x 10°
data points). Fortunately. our RA event deﬁnition was concerned only with comparing the
maximum control and effort voltages (Vc and Ve). Inspection of typical tape data showed that
most of the signal was small amplitude noise (~ few millivolts). We set a lower level
discriminator. therefore. to reject the built of the data points and store only the larger pulses.
Three environmental variables (magnetic ﬁeld. sonic intensity. and mechanical acceleration) were

recorded as analog signals on a chart recorder. The PZT differential signal was recorded as an
analog signal and digitized.

B. Environmental Exclusion

Any tape that exhibited a PZT output clearly above typical baseline response was set aside
for careful examination. That tape was not included in the cumulative digital record at the time of
internal inspection. Nine control session tapes and six effort session tapes were set aside.

The chart recorder was used to initially correlate the PZT signal on the fifteen tapes with
the output of the environmental detectors. In four cases a PZT event was clearly correlated with
an environmental detector output. Those environmental events could be separated into two
categories. The first category was a PZT signal that occurred after a long (~ 10-20 seconds)
low-frequency audio event. Our acoustic shielding fell away rapidly below ~ 500 Hz. And. as we
note in the susceptibility testing section in Appendix B. a long low—frequency signal could most
easily excite the PZT sensors. We hypothesize that a jet plane passing overhead could easily have
generated such an artifact. The second type of environmental artifact was clearly electromagnetic

in origin since it affected all sensors simultaneously. The artifact probably resulted from

low-frequency radiation that coupled into all sensors or perhaps all inputs at the recorder.

As environmental artifacts were identified. the tape in question was added to the
cumulative record. We elected to exclude the artifact. plus 1 minute of data record before and
after the artifact to be certain that no spurious signals were digitized. Remarkably, out of 138
hours of recorded data. only four events were excluded due to environmental artifact. Since the

duration of each event was less than one second. the actual artifact rate was only about 10-‘ per
second.

Those PZ‘I‘ events that were not clearly related to an environmental artifact using the
processed signal and chart recorder were further reviewed using the precision signal analyzer
(Scientiﬁc-Atlanta SD-38OZ) employed in susceptibility testing. Each PZT event was then
carefully compared to each environmental monitor output. using both time and frequency
domains. Only PZT events displaying no correlation with artifact signals were included in the final
record. No new exclusions were found with this added level of analysis.

C. Cumulative Data Record

After exclusion of all environmentally related events. the ﬁnal voltage histogram was
prepared. The comparison of all effort and all control sessions can be seen in Figure 3. We have
shown only the extreme tail of the distribution in order to conserve space. Since Vc is defined by
the maximum absolute voltage signal in the control sessions. the balance of the histogram can be
ignored. We note that the shape of the two curves is essentially identical.

Figure 4 shows a typical session voltage distribution with the discriminator set at “0.” In
other words. all PZT signals were stored. including the electronic noise background. From
inspection it appears that the total system noise was approximately normally distributed.

From the cumulative plot one can see that although the maximum voltage appeared in the
RA effort data record. it did not substantially exceed Vc. The ratio of channel numbers
(1652/1525) is 1.083. much lower than our criterion of 1.5.

D. PZ’I‘ Signal Analysis

During digitization of the ﬁnal tapes that contained the large amplitude PZT events. we
noticed that the maximum channel number varied by a few percent when the digitizing

process was repeated. Our interpretation of this effect was that the signal contained frequency
components that approached our sampling rate. thereby yielding some variation in the measured
channel number due to aliasing.

In order to be completely objective in comparing Vc and Ve. we identified the largest
control and effort events and compared their amplitude using the Scientific-Atlanta (SA) signal
analyzer. That instrument can digitize signals up to 20 kHz. It is also possible that the signal
processing we used in collecting the cumulative voltage histogram introduced some distortion into
these large transients. Therefore. we used the unprocessed PZT signals in the SA analysis.

The largest RA event amplitude in the SA instrumental configuration was about 3.5 volts.
The largest control event was 2.8 V using the same setup. This corresponds to a ratio of VeNc =
1.25. still below our definition of a candidate RA event. As further evidence of artifact. the effort
event and the control event had similar frequency characteristics.

V CONCLUSIONS

We believe that this joint effort has produced the mOSt elaborate and exhaustive RA
experiment ever conducted with PZTs. By whatever measure we apply. Ve did not equal 1.5 Vc.
The SA spectral analysis indicated the nearest approach was 1.25 Vc.

In conclusion. we found no evidence for an RA effect on a PZT.

FINAL REPORT

JFKU 1987 REMOTE ACTION RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

1. INTRODUCTION

-Following the SRl-based Piezo Remote Action (Piezo-RA) pilot
study performed in 1986, the tasks set for activities at John F.
Kennedy University (JFKU) in 1987 were to recruit and train a
number of potential Piezo-RA agents in preparation for a fully
formal Piezo-RA evaluation study to be performed at SR1. The
best Piezo-RA agents originating from the JFKU-based training
phase were to be made avai.able for participation in the SR1-
based evaluation study. The instrumentation at SR1 and JFKU was
to be developed further, with the SR1 instrumentation being
brought to the level required to eliminate or monitor all ‘nown
causes of effects. A new protocol was to be utilized which JOUId
effectively preclude accidental or fraudulent interference with
the instrumentation by subjects, both at SR1 and JFKU. in order
to accomplish this task, trainee selection procedures and Piezo-
RA training sessions were to be performed at JFKU. Consulting
support for the modification of the instrumentation for the SRI-
based evaluation study was also to be provided to SR1.

in 1987, as in 1986, the highest priority was assigned to
the maximization of results at SRI, since the evaluation study
was being performed at SR1. It was agreed in advance that in
order to maximize the resources which could be applied to the
SRl-based system within the operating budgetary contraints, the
two systems at JFKU would not be instrumented to the degree
necessary for a proof-of-principle study. The instrumentation at
SR1 was equipped to detect evironmentally occurring potential
causes of artifactual response by the piezo strain-gauge sensor
system, being equipped for the detection of low level acoustic
noise, vibration, magnetic field fluctuations, ionizing radiation
etc. and was located on a vibration attenuating support within an
acoustically shielded room. By contrast, the JFKU-based
instruments were not equipped with environmental monitoring
systems, and the two JFKU-based instruments differed in their
noise characteristics quite substantially. as is described in
section 4 and Appendix I detailing the control run results. It
was therefore understood in advance that the results from the
JFKU systems would not be equivalent to the results obtained with
the SRl-based system, in terms of their evidentiality.

Given this constraint on the JFKU-based systems, and given
that the highest priority goal was the supply of Piezo-RA agents
to SRI, it was decided that the JFKU-based training phase would
operate on the principle of maximizing the Piezo-RA performance
of trainees.

Final Report: RA Research Activities at John F. Kennedy University

This made it impossible to run the training phase as a formal
study, for several considerations, three primary reasons being
outlined below.

(i) The formalization of the training phase at JFKU would have
prevented the development of the most promising trainees'
performance to the highest level possible. In a formal
study. equal machine time and trainer attention would have
had to :e given to all trainees.

(ii) Since it was impossible to predict in advance whether any
given trainee would suddenly improve or temporarily
decline in performance, it appeared to be prudent not to
deselect trainees whose performance was at a lower level
'than the best trainees’, just in case their performance
improved greatly, and in order to provide a second cohort
of "backup" participants if any members of the leading
group should drop out or decline temporarily in
performance. This prohibited the option of spliting the
participant group into continuing and deselected groups at
an arbitrary point.

(iii) Since the noise characteristics of the two JFKU-based
Piezo-RA detection systems differed, generating a
difference in feedback properties and hence perceived
lability, and participants were scheduled according to the
availability of the systems. trainees performed differing
numbers of training sessions with each instrument. it
could therefore be expected that between-subjects
differences in performance would be generated from this
source too.

The training phase activities should therefore be viewed as being
non-formal in character, and as being directed to the
maximization of trainees' performance, rather than as being a
formal study. Nevertheless, several psychological features
emerged which suggest possibly useful hypotheses to be tested in
formal training studies of Piezo-RA performance.

2. [BAINEE SELECTION AND RECRUITMENT

It was originally intended that participants in the 1987 research
activities would be recruited from two.sources, one being from
the small group of the three most successful participants in
1986, the other being via a recruitment drive targeted on the
individuals obtaining the best ostensible RA results and highest
PIF scores in the 1986 screenings (lsaacs 19863). As events
transpired, trainees for the 1987 research were recruited from
four sources. Two (42 & 43) were retained from the 1986 trainee
group (the third member relocated away from the Bay Area). One
(41) was recruited from the only screening (lsaacs 1981)
performed in this research cycle. Two (45 & 49) were recruited
through the recruitment drive based on the screening results of the

1986 research cycle. The remaining trainees (44. 46. 47, 48, 50)
were recruited by contacts.

The selection of individuals identified by screening had
been performed by first ranking the screenees on the basis of two
measures: their ostensible RA performance during the screening
they attended, and their PlF scores. During the screening, each
screenee had been given a brief (30 seconds to 2 minutes) trial
on a strain-gauge based screening device (lsaacs 1986a) and had
been given an informal test of ostensible paranormal metal-
bending ability. The experimental personnel present at the
screenings had monitored the strain gauge device and had
witnessed most of the metal-bending. and had annotated the scores
from the screening device and comments about the metal-bending
onto the screenees's PlFs. lf screenees had either produced an
.effect likely to be over the noise level of the screening device.
‘or had bent metal. their PlF was then evaluated for its total
score and put into the group to be ranked. It should be noted
that the screening procedure is not claimed as in any way
producing definitive evaluations of RA ability (lsaacs 1981), the
presumption being only that some subset of the gro , at the
screening actually possessing RA ability will be present in the
group showing ostensible success at one or the other or both of
the screening tasks.

For the purposes of a comparative analysis, the PIP scores
of the 1987 trainee group were merged with those of the 189 PlFs
derived from the 1986 screening activities (lsaacs 1986a) and a
ranking of PlF scores for the total group (1986 screenees and
1987 trainees) was derived. The analysis of the rankings
obtained by the 1987 trainee group within the total group of PlFs
clearly must be regarded with caution because of the small number
of individuals involved.

Two results emerge from this analysis. One is relatively
unsurprising. The individuals recruited by contact (by
experimental personnel blind to PlF. but not, of course, blind to
the potential participants’ informal verbal reports of
spontaneous psi functioning) scored high on PlF. PIF scores for
the individuals recruited by contact strongly resemble those of
the screened individuals who would be targeted for recruitment.
based on their ostensible RA performance at the screenings and
high PlF scores.

Second. somewhat unexpectedly, the scores of the 1987
trainee group on PlF strongly suggest the presence of two rather
different groups among the recruited trainees. The possible
discovery of two seemingly distinct trainee populations is an
interesting finding. since it has direct relevance to the further
development of strategies for trainee recruitment and selection.

Final Report: RA Research Activities at John F. Kennedy University 1987

To contextualise the second finding. it is necessary to describe
the PIP and the way it has been used for trainee selection. The
criteria used for the selection of prospective Piezo-RA trainees
from the PIP data recovered from the 1986 screenings were based
on three measures which were used in a convergent fashion. These
were described in more detail in the 1986 Final Report (lsaacs
1986). The first was the screenee’s responses on the RIP. The
second was their performance at an instrumented RA task, and the
third was their macroscopic metal-bending performance.

The PlF is an inventory of ostensible psi-related
experiences which has been formulated specifically to focus on
spontaneous psi experiences thought to involve elements of
spontaneous Remote Action effects. The first seventeen questions
of PlF are directed to eliciting information about spontaneous
psi experiences. Responses are categorised into four types, "no"
indicates that the screenee has never had the experience cited in
the question, "1” indicates that the experience has occ:rred
once. "2" indicates ”more than once. several times". and ”3"
indicates "often. frequently". Eight of the seventeen psi
experience (Psi - "P") questions are RA-specific (questions 1, 2.
30 a, so 60 8 and 14).

Question 18 is intended to sample the respondent's general
belief in the reality of Remote Action (Belief 1 - "81").
Question 18 asks ”Do you think it’s possible to affect physical
objects without touching them ?”. Question 19 is intended to
sample the resp'ndent's specific belief about whether they
themselves could produce RA effects (Belief 2 - "82”). Question
19 asks ”Do you think that you can affect physical objects
without touching them 7". Question 20 (Mental Skills - ”5”)
requests information about the screenee’s prior practice of
mental skills of various sorts (eg. meditation, visualisation
etc.).

The analysis of the PlF questionnaire data used for targeting
individuals for recruitment was organised around three concepts.
The first was the measure of frequency of various spontaneous
ostensibly psi-related experiences. This measure was taken by
summing the scores for the P questions on the PIP (the first 17
questions). If the respondent replied ”no” to any of the
questions. for those answers they scored zero. If they checked
the ”1" answer they scored 1. if ”2" they scored 2 and 1f ”3”.
they scored 3. The summed score for the 17 psi experience
questions constitutes their ”P" score. The responses to
questions 18 (81) and 19 (82) are listed separately. The two
belief questions offer a scale of 1 to 5 to be checked, value 1
being ”definitely no”. value 5 being "definitely yes". The
scores for these questions were the raw score responses checked
by the respondents.

For question 20. the number of separate mental skills for which
practice was claimed constituted their "S” sccre. thus it the
respondent checked three skills they obtained a score of 3. The
total score was computed by summing the P, 81, B2 and S scores.

Table i. 1987 Trainees Ranked by PlF Scores

The trainees appear to split into two groups. The majority have
high P scores and high S scores, representing a high frequency
and wide range of reported spontaneous ostensible psi experiences
and a wide experience of mental disciplines. All but onevof this
group of eight are professional or semi-professional psi
practitioners of various sorts. The PlF rankings of this
subgroup are, as can be seen, consistently high. The eight
members of this group are distributed in only the top thirteen
PlF scores. It will be remembered that these are the highest
scores from the complete set of 189 PlFs collected during the
1986 and 1987 screenings. This group could oe described as
having a "psi practitioner” profile.

in contrast to this group. trainees 50 and 44 have much
lower rankings, 45 and 55 respectively, in the PIP scores,
representing lower P and much lower S scores. These scores do,
however. seem likely to be above the norm for the unselected
general population.

Participant 50 was recruited because she had contacted JFKU
for assistance regarding the ostensible recurrent spontaneous
psychokinesis (RSPK) events which she reported. These events
were reported as involving the occurrence of ostensibly
paranormal knocking sounds and movements of objects. In
parapsychological terminology, participant 50 is a poltergeist

focus. and reports RSPK events as still occurring in her home.

Participant 44 was recruited because she was originally the
"confidant” of participant 49 and asked for a trial on one of the
Piezo-RA detection systems. when she produced an event of
magnitude 1?. Participant 44 claims to have caused spontaneous
and deliberate RA events of RSPK type during her childhood.
Participants 44 and 50 do not appear to have experienced the very
'wide range of ostensible psi experiences reported by the
practitioner group, and apparently have not practised the mental
skills of the practitioner group.

The principal characteristic leading to 44 and 50 being
recruited were-their claims of the occurrence of spontaneous RA
events in their presence. They could be described as having
"RSPK" profiles. rather than practitioner PIF profiles. However.
of the eight practitioner trainees. only two appeared to cause
events above the noise threshold on the'SRl-based -
instrumentation. whereas both of the two RSPK profile
participants appeared to cause events above the noise threshold
on the SRI-based instrumentation. Although the sample sizes are
far too small to justify more than a very tentative hypothesis to
be formulated. these results are certainly not inconsistent with
the hypothesis that RSPK profile individuals may be especially
worth training in hopes of producing an RA capacity for
experimental purposes.

3.(i) IN§TRUMENTATION: MODIFICATIONS FQR 1987 RESEARQH

The 1986 final report outlined a number of improvements which
were suggested should be made to the JFKU-based computerized
Piezo~RA instrumentation. The modification of the software, in
particular the removal of fixed periods of feedback and later in
this research period, the increase of gain programmed into the
audio feedback function, greatly improved the performance of the
JFKU-based devices, making them psychologically more suitable for
RA training purposes. All scoring units referred to below and
elsewhere in this report are quoted in units of the analog to
digital converter counts used in the Piezo-RA detection systems,
which were 410 to the volt, making each unit (= 1 count)
equivalent to about 2.5 mV. .

As in 1986 (lsaacs 1986a), the two RA detection systems
produced immediate audio and visual feedback. Events above a
software selectable lower threshold were recorded by means of a
printer. A software selectable upper threshold defined the range
of magnitude between which the audio and visual feedback systems
operated. except for the lowest range audio feedback which
operated from below the lower threshold (putatively from the
system noise floor) up to the lower threshold. Recording of
above-threshold events was performed by means of a printer which
recorded the outputs of both Piezo strain sensitive elements. In
addition, in training sessions, but not during control runs, two
channel chart recorders were used to continuously record the
output of both Piezo elements.

Approved For Release 2002111118 : ClA-RDP96-00787R000300300001 -7
Final Report: RA Research Activities at John F. Kennedy University 1987

The two Piezo-RA detection systems used at JFKU differed
substantially in their instrinsic noise level, as can be seen in
the control run responses of the two systems. System 1 is
substantially quieter than system 2. This created a definite
difference in psychological conditions for trainees using the two
different systems.

To compensate for the difference in noise level. which was
not immediately apparent in the earliest phase of training
because of the high threshold level used (20 units, see section
S.(v)(a). the software selectable lower threshold levels at which
scores were recorded which came to be used were generally much
lower for system 1 than for system 2. Even when the system 1
lower threshold was at the minimum level possible for that
system. it was markedly less labile (i.e. spontaneously active in
producing purely noise-driven printed score outputs via the data
recording system) even at the lower threshold than was system 2.

This feature had the effect_of making the two systems seem
rather different from each other to the trainees, who had little
comprehension of technical matters and therefore wondered how it
could be that it appeared to be easy to get scores of 5 or 6 from
system 2, yet it appeared to be much more difficult to get scores
of 2 or 3 from system i. This situation clearly demonstrated the
desirability, for psychological reasons, of making all the RA
systems closely comparable in sensitivity, noise level, and hence
feedback properties.

3.(ii) ARTlFACT SOURCES: ELECTRlClTY SUPPLY TRANSIENTS

The shielding of the Piezo-RA transducers and their associated
signal conditioning and preamplifier units within electromagnetic
interference (EMI) attenuating enclosures and the electrical
isolation of this instrumentation by the use of battery power and
electrically non-conducting fiber optic data output leads
presumably is effective in preventing the ingress of E"! to that
part of the Piezo-RA detection instrumentation enclosed in the
attenuating enclosures. The fiber optic leads convey the output
signal from the front-end instrumentation to the feedback and
data recording units.

Tests at JFKU disclosed that despite the EHl filters on the
AC electricity supply to the computerized Piezo-RA feedback and
recording equipment (STD box, computer terminal and printer)
transients on the electricity supply could trigger large (>1000
units) artifactual responses from the system. A readily
performable test to demonstrate this was to pull the plug of a
functioning piece of mains-powered equipment (e.g. a cassette
player/radio) out of an electricity supply socket in the same
room-in which the Piezo-RA equipment was functioning. It was
anown in advance that this was a possible source of artifactual
signals for the JFKU-based systems. This source of artifact
should have been eliminated from the SRl-based system because
data recording was performed not by the computerized feedback
system, but by means of an FM tape recorder. However. since the
JFKU-based systems showed a clear susceptibility to this form of
artifact, this generates a concern as to whether the FM tape

recorder used SRl for data recording was indeed adequately
protected from the ingress of electricity supply transients (see
section 6.(ii) for a brief discussion of this source of
artifact).

Naturally, trainees were prohibited from switching mains-
powered equipment during RA training sessions. However. the JFKU
laboratory suite is located in a building, parts of which are
used as a high school, and the possibility that switching of
mains powered equipment in the school section could create
artifactual signals must be born in mind. Despite this, it
appears from tests performed at the laboratory site that the RA
system is not affected by transients created more than about 5
metres distance from the RA detection equipment. Nevertheless.
the results of one of the control runs for system 1 suggest that
on rare occasions EMI may have penetrated the feedback and data
recording systems (see sections 4.(i) and 4.(ii)). '

3.(iii) ARTIFACT SOURCES: ACOUSTIC NOISE AND VIBRATION

The RA sensor enclosures of two JFKU-based RA detection systems
were placed in separate rooms located some 20 metres from each
other. Both rooms were in the rear section of the laboratory
suite. which is separated by a small hallway and passages from
the front section of the laboratory. The two feedback and
recording systems of the instruments were located in separate
rooms in the front section of the laboratory. During RA training
sessions. trainers and trainees would be located in the rooms in
which the feedback and recording apparatus was located. and no
personnel would be present in the rear part of the laboratory
suite.

The two enviro ments in which the RA target systems were
located were not wholly free from acoustic noise-and vibration.
The rear section of the laboratory is separated by a single wall
from a set of rooms in the building which is used as a high
school. The teenagers attending.the high school were noisy and
sometimes films would be shown at quite loud sound levels in the
high school section of the building. with both systems, the
slamming of doors in the nearest rooms to the RA equipment within
the section of the building used as a high school produced small
Outputs, not above the two thresholds (1 for system 1, S for
system 2), but definitely visible as deflections in the pen trace
of the chart recorded output from the systems. Slamming the
doors of the rooms in the laboratory suite next to the room in
which the system 1 sensor assembly was located was definitely
capable of generating artifactual above threshold (of magnitude
1) signals. This was found out by testing. Control runs 3, 4, 5
and 6 for system i had to be discarded because of activity during
the control runs in the room next to it (see section 4.(ii)).

Except for a few sessions (see section -.(ii) below) RA
training sessions were held while the laboratory was empty of
other personnel than those involved in the RA sessions. Quite
often both RA systems would be in use simultaneously, but once
the systems were running, no personnel would be present in rooms

immediately adjacent to them. During set-up periods when the
experimenters were switching on and preparing equipment, their
movements were quiet. and no artifactual effects from the
activities of experimental personnel wer: recorded.

a.(i) CONTROL RUNS: INTROQQCTION

it should be born in mind from the comments made in the
introduction and in sections 3.(ii) and 3.(iii) above, that:

(a) no artifact monitoring systems were installed in the
instrumentation supplied to JFKU and,

(b) artifactual events due to EHl ingress had definitely been
established as possible with system 1 (section 3.(ii)) and,

(c) probably, particularly loud noises originating from the high
school suite could contribute to the noise level intrinsic to
system 2 by additive summation with the electronic noise.

These factors taken together mean that the control run data does
not represent just the intrinsic noise of the two detection
systems, but includes also signals above the noise level due to
the two possible sources of artifact already described.

Control runs were of variable length and the majority were
run during the daytime when the high school was in operation. It
was decided to set the thresholds of the two systems as low as
possible during control runs, consistent with the collection of
manageable amounts of data. The threshold referred to is that
which defines the operation of the recording of signals at the
occurrence of signals of magnitude one unit above the threshold
level. Setting the threshold level at 5 would cause the systems
to record all events of 6 or greater magnitude: setting a
threshold level of 1 would cause the recording of all events of
magnitude 2 or greater. The use of the lowest possible threshold
in control runs ensured that the noise floor was accesssible to
inspection. The two thresholds used for control runs were lower
than, or the same as. those in use for experimental runs.

During the most intensive training phase it proved very
difficult to gather large amounts of control run data because of
the extensive use of the systems during the daytime for training
purposes. At this period too. the use of replacement batteries
had not been put into operation, so that after use for
experimental purposes, the systems were generally put on charge
sometimes during the day and usually during night in preparation
for the next training session. The majority of those control
runs performed after the period of intensive training were done

s when the high school was in operation during the day and would
therefore sample the normal daytime noise levels.

The control run data for both systems is present in appendix
l.

4.(ii) SYSTEM ONE CONTROL RUNS

System 1 was, as will be seen by comparision of the twenty
control runs for this system with those of system 2, much less
noisy than system 2. A higher threshold (5 units) was used for
the first eight control runs and for the tenth control run (3
units being assigned by mistake for control run 9) than for all
of the subsequent control runs, 11 through 24, which were set at
a threshold of 1.

Control runs 3, 4, 5 and 6 had to be discarded because of
artifacts deriving from door slamming in the room next to the
system 1 sensor system. A JFKU student was performing some
experimentation during this period which was conducted
exclusively in the evening (when training sessions using system 1
were NOT held). Despite requests to move around quietly, this
student persisted in slamming the door of the room immediately
next to the system 1 RA sensor unit. Signals were generated in
these control periods which were very much larger than the signal
levels characteristic of normal control runs. Rather than
attempt to partition out those signals in these runs which were
due to the student's activity from those which were not, it was
decided to discard this data from the control run dataset and
perform more control runs to bring the total to twenty. The
distance between system 1 and system 2 sensor units provided
adequate protection of the system 2 sensor unit from artifactual
outputs due to activities in the vicinity of system 1 sensor
unit.

It will be seen that in general, system 1 has a well bounded
noise distribution. with the cutoff being at 4 units. Two
unusual events are recorded however. one being an event of
magnitude 6, occurring at 3.07 pm in control run 16 (9/8l'87),
and one of magnitude 9 at 3.06 am (7/21/‘87) in control run 16.
These two events may simply be characteristic of the distribution
of the noise. but the fact that there are no events atall of
intermediate magnitudes (ie of magnitudes 5, 7, or 8) recorded in
any of the control runs suggests that perhaps these two events
may be due to rare electrical transients caused by the switching
of automatic equipment. it is difficult to imagine loud
percussive n -ses occurring at 3 am at the JFKU laboratory site,
unless some the high school students broke in to their school.
or unless there was an earthquake. An earthquake would be more
likely to produce a series of signals (because of the rocking of
the RA detection systems on their passive air suspension
systems), and would presumably produce signals on both systems.
System 2 shows no signal recorded during a period from 1 hour 18
minutes before the system 1 event of 9 units to 49 minutes after
the event. For the system 1 event of magnitude 6, there is an
event of magnitude 8 units at 3.05 pm on system 2. Given the
fact that timing was performed by software clocks this may
correspond to the event on system 1 at system 1's recorded time
of 3.07 pm. but in the absence of environmental monitoring of
both systems, further hypothesising regarding the causes of these
two unusally large magnitude events in the system 1 control run
data would be unfruitful. -

4.(iii) SYSTEM TUO CONTROL RUNS

Sysfem 2 shows very much more spontaneous activity than system 1.
Howe.er. the noise distribution seems quite well bounded. no
events being recorded above 9 units magnitude in any of the
control runs. The threshold used was 5 units for all control
runs except for control run 12 which was discarded because the
‘threshold had been set at 6 for this control run by mistake. It
will be seen (appendix 1) that system 2's event count in control
runs is somewhat variable, presumably representing the effect of
the high school as a nearby source of vibration. System 2's
variable noise performance was puzzling because it did not seem
to reflect ambient acoustic noise levels as peceived by the
experimental personnel.

5.(i) AlNlNG 5 NS: 1M NA Y RI NTATIDN OF PART! P

A total of some twenty-five individuals were invited to each
participate in one of two separate day-long orientation sessions
which were described to participants as being RA training
preliminary "workshops”. lnvitees to the workshops were selected
by the methods outlined in section 2. above.

The individuals invited to the first workshops had been
found from three of the four sources mentioned in section 2
above, viz. retained participants from 1986, individuals found by
contacts and individuals selected from the PIP records generated
by the 1986 screenings} The screenees selected by the procedure
described in section 2. above, were then contacted by telephone,
starting from the first ranking, and going down the list until
sufficient willing individuals were invited (16).

The "workbook” prepared for the orientation workshop is
included in appendix lV. There were four main goals of the
preliminary workshop:

(i) To allow the experimental team to assess participants, in
an informal setting, for their suitability for RA
training.

(ii) To provide potential RA trainees with sufficient
information regarding the RA experimental activities and
commitments to allow them to make an informed judgement
regarding their willingness to participate in the study.

(iii) To elicit the reactions of participants towards RA
performance and RA training, allowing opportunity for the
discovery of negative attitudes towards RA, RA training,
and possible blocks to performance.

(iv) To provide a thorough orientation towards the goals of the
research, to initiate the process of participants
developing RA facilitation strategies, to give them some
initial experience with RA detection systems and to
initiate the bonding of participants as a group.

Final Report: RA Research Activities at John F. Kennedy University

The workshop appeared to be quite successful in achieving the
four sets of goals. One problematical occurrence was that one of
the participants aroused the group’s fear of the destructive use
of RA by recounting her claimed semi-intentional use of RA when a
teenager to negatively affect other people. This initiated a
lengthy discussion regarding the ethical issues involved in
training RA ability which consumed rather more time than
desirable, but which was unavoidable, given the situation. This
workshop participant declined to participate in the study. A
later, second-level orientation workshop was run for all the
participants selected for RA training after their first few
training sessions. The content of the second workshop was very
similar to the first, although it also contained content from the
mental skills training procedures (see Appendix V).

After the preliminary workshop, the willing individuals who
were evaluated as being promising potential-RA trainees were then
interviewed and, if they had not already done so, completed the
PIP and signed the statement of consent. The decision as to
which individuals were to be interviewed was based on several
criteria. One was their ostensible RA performances to date.
Others were their personality characteristics and general
stability and attitudes towards experimentation and RA. The
potential trainee's willingness to participate, freedom to
schedule training sessions during the weekdays, place of domicile
(and hence Journey time to the JFKU laboratory in Ualnut Creek),
and general attitudes, were all non-RA factors which
pragmatically impacted the probability of their selection.

The approach of the JFKU based research group towards
participant selection and training appears to be very similar to
that developed at SRl. Since a long term stable commitment to
participation is required, adult participants who are in stable
social and domestic situations are preferentially selected. This
approach contrasts greatly with the one-shot use of college
students which seems very common in psychology and many
psychoenergetic studies.

5.(ii) THE PARllClPANT EVAQQATION SESSION

In order to provide more data to constrain the selection of
trainees, it was decided that all potential trainees would be run
in a single 1 hour long evaluation session, with the threshold of
the RA detection system set at a level of 20 units. Nineteen
potential trainees had reached this stage of the selection
process and were run in an evaluation session. The decision
regarding which individuals were to be selected for training was
arrived at by a convergent process, with data inputs from their
screening performance, PlF scores, behavior in the first workshop
and results in the evaluation session. The facilitation of the
trainees' optimum RA performance in the evaluation session and
early training sessions was hampered by three important
inhibitory factors which were not fully appreciated at the time
(see section 5.(v)(b) below).

The results of the evaluation session are counted as

training session 1 in the RA tra.ning results (Appendix II). As
wi be seen, three participants (Nos. 44, 48 and 50) did manage
to create effects substantially above the noise floor of the
detection system during their first session with the
instrumentation. However, the majority did not, and the chart
reco: resulting from the session (see section 3.(i)) was

there Jre used as a guide to participant evaluation, together
with the Judge" at of the experimenters who ran the participants
and their screu.ing results. The first serious encounter with
the RA detection system seemed to have a highly motivating effect
for some participants, as will be noted in sections 5.(v) and
S.(vi). Seven of the group of nineteen individuals evaluated by
this convergent process were selected for RA training.

S.(ii) MENTAL “KILLS TRAINING

During the training phase of the previous research cycle it had
been observed that certain participants used RA facilitation and
elicitation techniques which seemed in some cases to assist the
participants in a number of ways, including positive mood shift,
orientation of attention towards the RA task. relaxation, and the
induction of positive belief states regarding the RA task. It
was decided that in 1987 an effort would be made to try to
compile and document a collection of such techniques, to be
offered to trainees on an optional basis.

A difficult decision was faced regarding the stage at which
to teach trainees to use these techniques. which had either been
identified as possibly helpful to RA facilitation in the previous
research cycle, or which it was decided to introduce because they
had been used with apparent success in other areas of psychology,
notably in sport psychology (Straub 1980, williams 1986) and
behavioral therapy (Gambrill 197?). _

Prior to the initiation of the training phase of the 1987
activities. Dr. Corwin, a member of the JFKU research team,
undertook to perform a survey of the RA elicitation techniques
used by participants in the previous cycle, together with a
limited survey of elicitation techniques described in the
literature on RA-like effects (see Appendix V). In addition to
these sources, techniques deriving from sport psychology and
behavior therapy were surveyed. The resulting eclectic selection
of elicitation and facilitation techniques was written up in the
form of three "Mental Skills Acquisition" (HSA) workbooks by Dr.
Corwin, with consultation from the other members of the RA
experimental team. The three HSA workbooks are included as
Appendix V.

The decision when to teach participants the MSA techniques
was difficult to take, because little hard data exists regarding
the effects of such action and its interaction with RA training.
Ideally, an independent groups design of training study should be
performed to investigate the relative effects of starting MSA
training at different points in the RA training process. The
factors involved in the decision were complex.

First, since the training session length had been defined as

being no more than 90 minutes, the taking of time for the
teaching of MSA techniques to trainees would reduce available
machine time during the session. Second, -he learning of "SA
techniques might become a higher priority than RA performance, so
that decrements in RA performance and motivational conflicts
might result from attempts to perform both activities in the same
sessions. Third, it seemed likely that the mental set needed for
learning of much of the MSA material would be analytical, rather
than non-analytical and global. This might decrement RA
performance, which appears to be a right-hemispheric function.
Fourth, if the acquisition of "SA techniques might improve
trainees’ performance markedly, there was a case for starting MSA
training early in the RA training process.

It was decided to encourage trainees to learn some of the
MSA techniques during 60 minute periods taken in the first three
90 minute sessions. The underlying motivation was to equip
trainees with possibly useful techniques early in their training
process. It rapidly became apparent that this strategy was not
optimal. because trainees reported that learning the MSA
techniques during the training sessions did indeed divert them
from the RA task too much and shift them towards an analytical
frame of mind, which they perceived as being detrimental to RA
performance. Trainees also reported frustration at being denied
potential machine time for RA practice. The learning of "SA
material was therefore dropped from the sessions, the MSA
techniques being made available to participants on a pick-and-
choose "menu” basis. Some of the participants continued to use
the MSA techniques in sessions and the MSA workbook materials
were incorporated into the second workshop attended by
participants.

S.(iv) USE OF ”CONFIDAN:§”

It was noticed in the previous research cycle that some RA
trainees appeared to suffer a slight sense of isolation with
respect to the awareness and appreciation of their RA training
activities shown by their families or friends. This seemed
particularly so when close family members were indifferent or
even slightly hostile towards their participation in RA training.
it was.therefore decided to institute an extra system of support
for participants by recruiting ”confidants" for them. The role
and duties of the confidant were described in detail in the
protocol description document (lsaacs 1987b) describing the
proposed 1987 research activities which was submitted to the JFKU
Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS) as part of
its approval process. The relevant section is included below.

To promote the maintenance of high motivation. each

participant will be requested to nominate a "confidant". The
role of the confidant will be multifunctional. the overall
purpose being to provide the participant with support of their
RA training in their own social environment. Where possible,
family members will be chosen as confidants, otherwise close

friends will be selected. The confidant will be chosen on
the basis of their concern for the participant, and their wish
to assist the p ticipant in his or her RA training process.
Participants wi.. be requested to diSuuss each RA training
session with their confidant, and to actively brain-storm and
p.0blem-solve with them regarding problems, blocks or
limitations encountered. The confidant will provide an
additional feedback path for any problems which may arise
during the participant's training process to be communicated
to the RAP research team. Confidantes will be encouraged to
maintain close contact with the participant's
experimenter/trainer, to ensure that this function is
fulfilled.

Another important function performed by the confidant
will be to assist in the goal setting process by discussing
goals;”giving encouragement and praising good performance.
The confidants will be oriented in their duties by the RAP
research team, at a separate half-day meeting held when the
participants have all been recruited. Confidantes will be
invited to all the meetings of the participant/experimenter
group.

The confidant system appeared to work well and trainees reported
that they received significant benefit from having someone with
whom they could discuss their progress and brainstorm with
regarding problems. The confidants also fulfilled a useful
purpose in providing an extra route for information to flow
between participants and the experimenter group. The confidants
reported enjoying their role.

S.(v)(a)Pl§ZO-RA TRAlNlNG ﬁESSlONS: INTRODUCTION

The first session was the evaluation session and ran for 60
minutes. A gap of approximately two weeks occurred between the
first session and the second, due to the fact that nineteeen
participants had to be given a first session before the selection
process could be completed. From then on. 90 minute sessions
were performed at the rate of two a week for some six weeks. then
in general at a rate of three per week for the rest of the
training period. It was planned that sessions two through four
would be split between tuition of HSA techniques (60 minutes) and
RA training proper (30 minutes). However, trainees showed a
strong preference not to devote so much training time to USA
activity, so that this was in general ended before session four.
Some trainees recommenced limited MSA training later in the
training phase. at their option.

Starting at the first (evaluation) session. the threshold
was 20 units. It was rapidly found that this was demoralizing to
the trainees, and after the first few sessions (the number
varying between trainees) the thresholds were reduced to 5. and
some weeks later the system 1 threshold was usually set below 5.
The system 2 threshold was held at S because of its greater noise
characteristic. It must be stressed that just as in athletics

training, where the degree of difficulty and chal3.Jge of the
task must be carefully matched to the individual athlete
(williams 1986) in RA training it appears that to obtain maximum
performance, the trainees must be treated as individuals. with
the feedback characteristics of the RA system being adjusted for
each trainee. The imposition of a totally uniform threshold
setting would have restricted this option.

5.(v)(b)!NH!§lTQRY FACTORS EARL! lN TRAINING

Three major inhibitory factors created by the experimental
protocol were encountered in the early part of the RA training
phase. The first factor was generated from the somewhat
overconfident assumption by the JFKU research team that the
threshold of the RA detection systems could be set at 20 units
for beginning trainees. it will be recalled that the evaluation
session and first two or so subsequent training sessions were run
with this threshold level in operation. This decision was later
suspected to have created significant inhibition, since it
presented beginning trainees with an apparently non-responsive RA
detection system.

Batcheldor's theory of RA facilitation (Batcheldor 1984) and
the principles of operant conditioning (Gambrill 1977, lsaacs
1986b) clearly state that in order for responses which it is
desired to condition not to be extinguished, from the very
earliest occurrence of the responses, reinforcement is necessary.
In the RA training context this implies that RA responses of very
small magnitude must be reinforced, for the shaping of the
response towards the production of larger RA effects to be
successful (Gambrill 1977). In practice, this means that the RA
detection system noise floor must be sensorially discrimminable
and that the system should provide some form of apparently
positive response to the trainee to suggest that they are
succeeding from the very start of the training process.

Setting the threshold of the RA instrumentation at 20 units
created a situation where unless the potential trainee created
rather large effects (more than twice the largest noise signals
(9 units) occurring in the control runs), they would essentially
receive the impression from the RA detection system that they
could not produce RA effects. If beginning trainees could only
produce signals near noise level and well below the 20 unit
threshold, which is likely for novice trainees, this meant that
for the sessions run with this threshold in operation an
extinction paradigm was being operated, which could be expected
to negatively affect the potential trainees' RA responses.

This effect would have been reinforced by the fact that the
audio feedback system was at first not sufficiently sensitive to
very small signals to track the noise floor of the RA detection
system. Some 6 or so sessions into the training phase, a
sensitive supplementary audio feedback device was added to each
RA detection system which provided good audibility of the noise
floor by means of a voltage controlled oscillator which produced
a changing frequency of output in response to the noise floor.

In addition. a final software modification made the computer
generated audio feedback sufficiently sensitive at low levels of
signal to track the noise floor :ith moderate sensitivity.

However, the problems of the high threshold's effects and
the insufficiently sensitive audio feedback were not fully
appreciated during the earliest stage of the training process.
The instrumentation had been returned to SR! for modification
during the interim period before the renewed recruitment of
participants for the 1987 cycle. It had been returned from its
modification a month later than planned. Since there was a
danger of the training phase falling behind schedule. the RA
detection systems were put into service immediately, before the
JFKU experimental team had sufficient familiarity with the newly
modified systems to have fully'assessed them. Careful assessment
would probably have led to the decision to use a threshold just
above most of the noise floor from the start of training, and to
use a supplementary, sufficiently sensitive audio feedback device
from the beginning.

This situation provides an important, if obvious, lesson,
which is that in exposing participants to RA instrumentation. it
is essential to first carefully_evaluate the instrumentation
before exposing them to it. because the initial setback created
by unsuitable feedback properties may damage the prospects of RA
trainees. Unfortunately. since a formal study using independent
groups would be necessary to prove this point, this strong
suspicion remains as yet an hypothesis, but the literature of the
conditioned reflex would certainly underpin this hypothesis
(Gambrill 197?). To somewhat substantiate the hypothesis that
apparently non-labile feedback properties of RA target systems
inhibit RA, the events during the SRl sessions provide an
instructive although unintentional example. The first 11
sessions of the evaluation series held at SRl were run under
similar conditions of non-labile feedback, with null results.
Changing the feedback characteristics of the SRl system appeared
to dramatically facilitate the production of RA events. The
hypothesis that this factor is real was supported at least
informally by this unintentional use of an inhibitory condition
at SRl followed by its being made less inhibitory by the
introduction of apparent lability. Although no controlled study
of the effect of discouraging feedback has been performed to date
with the Piezo-RA effect, it is this author's strongly held view
that in both instances this condition (non-labile feedback)
severely reduced the RA performance which was obtained and
reduced the yield of data recovered from the SRl-based evaluation
study. .
What is doubly frustrating in retrospect is that the JFKU
experimental group strongly believes that this condition is
inhibitory of RA performance, yet allowed the two incidents to
occur. in both cases there seemed to be good reasons to pursue
the policy followed at the time. in the case of the over-high
threshold used at JFKU early in the training phase, it was the
group's over-optimistic belief that trainees would succeed in
producing events of magnitude 20 early in their training process
which was responsible for the initial use of this threshold
level. The provisxon of appropriate supplementary audio feedback

devices by Dr. lsaacs was done only when it had become clearly
apparent that the computerized audio feedback was not sensi'ive
enough, and when it was recalled that some equipment brough. from
England could be modified to serve as supplementary feedback
units.

S.(v)(c)AQJUSTM§Nﬂ TQ REMQTE RA TARGET SYSIEﬂ

The third inhibitory factor is of considerable relevance

to the future of RA studies and deserves investigation in its own
right. it was decided early in the protocol design stage that
JFKU participants and experimenters would not be allowed into the
room‘at SRI in which the Piezo-RA equipment was located once the
study had been started. This would provide security against the
possible charge by critics of subject or experimenter fraud on
the part of JFKU personnel. This condition was an essential
feature of the protocol because it protected against fraud and
allegations of fraud. In addition. the isolation of the Piezo-RA
sensor system from the acoustic noise and vibration and possible
local electrostatic and other fields which may exist in the
vicinity of personnel was also clearly essential.

However, the distancing of the Piezo-RA target system from
the individuals attempting to cause perturbations of the sensor
system is probably strongly inhibitory of effects. within the
parapsychological literature, distancing the RA agent from the
system to be affected, especially if the target system is placed
outside the room in which the putative RA agent is located, has
been notoriously inhibitory of RA performance (Batcheldor 1984).
Batcheldor (1981) asserts that the mechanism of this inhibitory
effect is via the negative impact that distance from the RA
target has on the belief of the putative RA agent. Since for
methodological reasons, the putative RA agent most be separated
from the target system, the optimization of RA agent performance
under this condition deserves investigation.

The choice faced by the JFKU investigators was between three
alternative means of adapting trainees to the remote location of
the RA target system. Each method of dealing with the inhibitory
effects of distance on RA is associated with risk of inhibition.

One solution would be to start with the target system at a
distance, located outside the trainee's room, so that the
participant has to deal with the most inhibitory condition from
the start. This approach runs the risk that the conditions of
training might be so inhibitory as to constitute an extinction
paradigm. The extinction paradigm is a conditioning situation
where responses are never reinforced, so that the responses in
question decline in frequency to zero (Gambrill 1977). if the
initial conditions are so inhibitory that no RA responses are
ever generated, no opportunity for reinforcement is produced, so
that after a period under these conditions. the likelyhood of an
RA response drops to zero. 0n the other hand, if trainees do
manage to produce effects under this condition, the dividend is
obtained that no subsequent major change of distance is
necessary.

The second option would be to start the training with the RA
target system in the same room as the trainee. This minimizes
inhibition, but at the cost of making results less certain,
because of the possibi.ity of artifactual outputs being created
by the activities of the trainer and trainee. it also only
defers the possible inhibition created by the removal of the
target system to a location outside the room. However, the
rationale for this approach is that initial inhibition is
minimized and the trainee's belief in their RA ability is
established by experience (assuming that they are successful in
the "close" condition) prior to the distancing of the target
system.

The third option is a variant of the second option. it
would be somehow to phase the removal of the RA target system,
taking it away from the RA trainee in stages, so as to retain the
occurrence of RA effects at each step, thus maintaining a
positive expectation. Batcheldor hypothesizes (1984) that this
incremental grading of the difficulty of an RA task is maximally
effective in promoting RA performance. Practical difficulties
involved.in this process, and the continuing temptation of the RA
trainee/trainer pair to regress back towards a closer condition
would have made this option very difficult to execute.

The only way in which the decision regarding the imposition
of the distant-target condition could be satisfactorily motivated
would be by data derived from experimental studies investigating
the outcomes of training independent groups where the distancing
of the RA target system was performed in the three ways described
above. In the absence of these results, the decision had to be
taken on purely pragmatic grounds. and the first option, of
starting in the distant condition, was chosen. One factor
motivating this decision was that since the trainees would have to
adapt to working in a different environment (SR1) from that in
which they trained. the imposition of yet another change in
conditions due to removal of the target system at JFKU would have
been adding to the changes in conditions. The 1986 research
cycle amply demonstrated the negative impact of frequent changes
in conditions and equipment on the performance of RA trainees.
in retrospect it is of course easy to provide reasons to doubt
that this decision was the best one, but in the absence of hard
data it was necessary to take it on the best available
information.

A possible further inhibitory condition may have been the
introduction of MSA training early on in the training process.

It is a reflection of the early stage of research in this area

that so many decisions in training procedure are unconstrained by
experimental data, and in this situation decisions have to be
taken on the best available information.

5.(v1)(a)BRlEF REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL RESULTS

Since the performance of trainees was highly individual, the
training process of each of the participants will be briefly
reviewed. It will be recalled that the training results of each
participant are included in Appendix II.

Participant 41

This participant was the only one recruited by the 1987
screening. He started producing signals clearly outside the
noise floor in session 5 and in sessions 11 and 13 produced a
total of 8 signals outside the noise lezel. As a result. he was
then submitted to 5 sessions at SRI. Unfortunately the first

of this group of SRI sessions were performed prior to the
modification of the SRI RA detection system's feedback
characteristics, so that the SRI system showed no lability.
Participant 41 produced no over-threshold effects at SRI. Since
he was observed to suffer from considerable shyness. it might be
hypothesised that the combination of inhibition due to his
shyness and the non-labile characteristics of the SRI system
affected his performance.

Participant 42

This participant was retained from the 1986 research cycle, where
she had performed quite well. She had not maintained her
practice of RA training between the 1986 and 198? cycles. Only
in training session 10 did she start to produce clearly over-
noise effects. and in sessions 11, 13 and 15 produced quite large
numbers of over-noise events. She subsequently performed 4
sessions at SR1. without producing clearly over-noise events.
Unfortunately this participant had commenced a form of employment
during the period when the SRI sessions were run which occupied
her time so much and fatigued her so severely that her RA
performance drastically declined and she was dropped from further
training in the i987 cycle.

Participant 43

This participant was retained from the 1986 research cycle. where
he had produced the majority of effects recorded. 0n resuming RA
practice, it took until the 6th session for him to produce a
clearly over-noise event. He produced a single further over-
noise event in session 12. in the context of a rather
disappointing overall training performance. It seems likely that
this resulted from this participant’s clearly stated preference
for working at SRI where the ”real” experiment was conducted.

The problem of this motivational aspect of the JFKU training
phase is reviewed briefly in section 6.(i). At SRI. 43 performed
17 sessions. 11 of them conducted under the extinction paradigm
condition created by the non-labile feedback characteristics

which the SR! system displayed at that time. It is remarkable
that 43 then succeeded in producing some ostensibly over-noise
effects at SR1. despite the discouraging regime of null results
for 12 or so previous sessions.

,Participant 44

This participant was recruited late in the course of the
experimentation. She had been the confidant of one of the
already-recruited participants and while attending one of her
trainee’s training sessions, requested a short trial on the RA
instrument':ion. to experience the training situation. She
produced a event well over the noise level of the system and was
immediately recruited into training where her overall performance
was disapppointing, since she produced no further over-noise
events. She performed 3 sessions at 531 and produced at least
one ostensibly over-noise event. '

Participant 45

This participant started producing over-noise events in session 5
and produced further such events in sessions 7, 12 and 14.
Starting at session 15 she performed 11 sessions at SR] and was
the best performer there, in terms of the magnitude and numbers
of her effects. She is an experienced psi practitioner and has
much experience of informal self-regulation disciplines.

Participant 46

Participant A6 claimed to have created macro-RA effects
previously and had a high PlF score. In training his performance
was almost uniformly disappointing. except for a period from
session 15 through 20. He was not selected for SRI sessions and
it was not understood why he did not achieve his apparent RA
potential. '

Participant 4?

Participant 47 was another trainee who had high PIF scores (she
was in fact the highest scoring PlF respondent) but did not
produce any putative RA events which were clearly above the noise
level.

Participant 48

This participant too, did not produce any clearly over-noise
events except for two very large events in her first session (of
magnitude 112 and 113 units). She was retained in training
because of her initial performance. Her training performance has
some interest because at session 16 she was transferred to 3

different trainer because of her poor progress. She then greatly
improved in event number production until session 24 when she and
her trainer had a severe conflict. This negatively impacted her
scoring, from which it recovered only slightly in session 30.

The difference in scoring between session 23, the last of the run
of improving scores, and session 24 and later sessions could be

hypothesised as illustratLve of the effects of interpersonal
dynamics on RA production.

Participant 49

Participant 49 did not achieve the promise implied by her PlF
scores. She :oduced no clearly over-noise events in training

and during the training period suffered various stressful
personal events in her private life.

Parti ant SO

Participant 50 was one of the three individuals to achieve an
over threshold event (magnitude 23) in her first RA session.
She reported the occurrence of RSPK events in her home to the
Graduate Parapsychology Program at JFKU and was consequently
recruited by contact. She took until session 14 to start
producing event numbers which seem to exceed the noise
characteristics of the RA system. He performance improved
irregularly from then on and after her 20th JFKU- based training
session she performed 7 sessions at SR1 where she produced
several ostensibly over- noise events.

S.(vi)(b)QVERALL TRAINING RE§QLTS

The overall results of the JFKU RA training phase, despite the
presumptively inhibitory effects of the early training
conditions, compare very favourably with the English RA training
studies. in the two formal longitudinal training studies
employing multiple subjects performed in England (lsaacs 1984) a
much lower proportion of subjects achieved an even relatively
consistent RA performance. in the first study. only one of the
five subjects achieved a satisfactory performance. and in the
second study only one of nine subjects performed similarly. In
the currently reported work. six of the ten participants achieved
over-noise effects at JFKU and of these six, four produced
ostensible over~noise events at SRl. This improvement over the
previous results may be due to the use of a larger population
from which the trainees were drawn. the elaborate multi-stage
selection procedure employed, and possible consequent superiority
of the individuals selected for training. Quite possibly the
improvements in training skills of the research personnel also
contributed to the outcome. The basic learning hypothesis - that

RA performance in selected subjects improves with practice also
seems to have been confirmed once again.

6.(i) SRl EVALUATION SESSIONS: MOTlVATlONAL AND lNHlBlTORY FACTORS
___________________________________________________________.

The design of participant orientation sessio.. by the
experimental group included elements specifically intended to
positively motivate participants towards the SRl sessions.
performance of which was presented as the goal of the training
phase. This treatment appeared to be very successful. since all
trainees expressed a strong desire to be selected for
participation in the SRl-based evaluation sessions. To some
extent. this motivation towards the performance of sessions at
SRl may possibly have been detrimental to maximizing performance
at JFKU. This certainly appeared to be possible for trainee 43.

Certai' inhibitory dynamics also operated with regard to the
SR! sessions. First, having to perform at a different, rather
non-familiar site could be expected to be inhibitory. Second,
for RA performance, the theoretician Batcheldor holds that
"crucial test" conditions are maximally inhibitory, because they
minimize belief and maximize doubt and ”resistance" to RA
(Batcheldor 1984). These factors may be mediated by their
effects on mood (lsaacs 1987a). Participants reported that they
felt somewhat intimidated by the alien and rather impersonal
characteristics of a professional research institute, despite the
efforts of Mr. Hubbard to provide a friendly reception.

Third. and crucially, the SR! RA detection system's feedback
properties were such, for the first eleven sessions, that the
system showed no apparent lability, its output not seeming to
fluctuate atall. This was interpreted by participants as the
system being "dead”, rather than ”alive” and responsive to their
attention, and "resistant”, rather than "compliant” to their
intention to affect it. As has been described before, in the
behavioral shaping of conditioned responses, if no reinforcement
of initial responses is given, the response will be extinguished,
rather than increased in frequency (Gambrill 1977). Exposing
participants to an RA detection system which provides
insufficiently sensitive feedback to enable sensory monitoring of
the noise floor to be performed prohibits the sensory detection
of small RA responses and provides no take-off points for a
positive belief and expectation of further success.

Eleven days of experimentation were performed under this
extinction paradigm. This clearly impacted the participants who
were run under this condition, and the rest of the JFKU group of
participants and experimenters as the news of the absence of
results spread through the group. The SRl RA detection system’s
feedback properties were then modified by increasing the gain of
the feedback channel, making it appear labile. This was followed
by the occurrence of over-threshold events in sessions, in
increasing numbers and magnitudes. it is this author's opinion
that had the feedback properties been of the higher gain from the
start of the SRl sessions, very many more RA events would have
been recorded in the study, and their magnitude would have
increased beyond the levels produced. it was extremely
unfortunate that the SRl system's feedback properties were
incorrectly perceived as being unalterable and non-negotiable by
the JFKU personnel, as was much else of the protocol (for good
reason). This was an unfortunate communication failure which

probably lost the study a substantial amount of-results.

The effects of the first eleven sessions’ null results were
compounded by the funding situation of the JFKU-based group,
which was dependent on success in the SRl study for it- future
funding. This situation was highly motivating for the group, but
was conducive to stress and anxiety, particularly on the part of
the principal investigator, who. not being a US citizen, was
dependent for continued residence in the US on the flow of
research funding. Since psi-mediated experimenter effects appear
to strongly impact psychoenergetic research (White 1977, 1978),
it seems quite likely that this situation may also have added to
the inhibitory factors at work during the SRl-based sessions. in
addition it was suspected that it must have been difficult for
the principal technical monitor of the SRl psychoenergetics
group, Mr. G. Scott Hubbard, to maintain a positive attitude.
both because of the well known doubt of the existence of RA
present in the SRl group. and because of the period of eleven
days of running participants prior to the obtaining of results
and consequent recording of fewer events than were expected.

This too could have produced an experimenter effect of reducing
the numbers and magnitude of putative RA events recorded.

What is remarkable is that so many of the participants who
performed at SRl during the non-labile period of the RA detection
system’s feedback still managed to achieve over-threshold results
on the device in sessions after the eleventh. The occurrence of
the first over-threshold event significantly affected the
participants, encouraging a belief that it was possible to
succeed at the task, a belief which Batcheldor takes to be
crucial to the occurrence of RA in experimental settings
(Batcheldor 1984).

5.(ii) INSTRUMENTAL CONSIDERATlONS

In the evaluation of the results of the control runs performed at
SR1, there is a concern which arises as a result of the
inspection of JFKU control run data for system i. The concern is
that since all of the data from the SR] sessions, including
control runs, was collected by means of an FM tape recorder, it
is crucial that the tape recorder’s rejection of electrical
transients occurring in the electricity mains should be good.

The algorithm which will be used in the evaluation of the
results will be that the largest magnitude noise signal occurring
in the control runs in the absence of above-noise signals

occurring in any of the environmental monitoring channels will be
taken as a criterion level. Putative RA events occurring in
experimental sessions will be compared to a magnitude equivalent
to 1.5 times the criterion level. RA events occurring in the

experimental sessions with a magnitude of 1.5 times the criterion
level and above. in the absence of above-noise signals in any of
the environmental monitoring channels, will be considered as
genuine events. The occurrence of four or more such events will
be con=idered as good evidence for the Piezo-RA effect.

The PM tape recorder’s immunity from mains-born electrical

interference is clearly crucial to the proper conduct of this
experiment. If a single, extremely rare occurrence of electrical
interference should create a single large signal in one of the
control runs, under the algorithm used for evaluation of the
results, this could cause the RA results in the experimental
sessions, which may not be comparable in size, to be considered
null. The relative length of the control runs compared to the
experimental sessions may render the occurrence of such an event
as more probable in a control run than in an experimental
session. so that the interference rejection characteristics of
the FM tape recorder are of crucial important to the results. it
is to be hoped that this feature of the tape recorder's
performance will have been carefully checked.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIQNS

Given the results of the 1987 training phase, the selection
process appeared to function quite well, implying that the
components of the selection process are effective. The selection
process could be improved further, possibly by the addition of
more psychometric measures, especially of neuroticism and
extraversion, since these appear to affect ESP performance
significantly and this effect may carry over for RA training
(Palmer 1978).

There were slight but definite indications that two trainee
populations may exist, one having a "psychic practitioner"
profile, the oth'r having a "RSPK" profile. This has several
implications, on. being that individuals reporting RSPK events
should be recruited as RA trainees for evaluation, another being
that some form or extra sorting procedure for splitting a
population having the "practitioner” profile into RA-capable and
non-capable groups could usefully be developed. in this
connection it is interesting to observe that all of the
participants who were successful at producing over-threshold
events at SRl had earlier produced over-noise events within six
training sessions or fewer at JFKU, suggesting that it may be
useful to utilize evaluation series of sessions of some six
sessions length and then deselect participants who show no over-
noise events by the sixth session. replacing them with fresh
trainees.

Several factors were encountered which are strongly
suspected of being inhibitory. These may have considerably
impacted trainees' RA performance by introducing inhibition in
the early stages of training. The first was the initial use at
JFKU of a feedback threshold for registering events which was too
far above the system noise level to provide the encouraging
recording of events which are in fact driven by noise, or in
which the noise which has been slightly incremented by RA. This
is the feedback-lability requirement for the successful "shaping"
of RA responses, referred to earlier in.section S(v)(b). The
second is the use of audio feedback which did not at first. but
should, make the noise floor accessible to sensory
discrimination. The third is the problem of the distancing of

the RA target from the putative RA agent. unavoidable for
methodological reasons. but which should be investigated so as to
constrain training decisions regarding target system placement on
the basis of experimental evidence. The fourth was the probably
inadvisable timing of mental skills training, which was seemingly
administered at the wrong stage of training, although the
_decision as to when these skills should be taught in the process
of RA training is a difficult one to constrain in the absence of
the pr oer studies. Finally, the SRl RA detection system's
feedbs-k was insufficiently labile for the first eleven sessions,
as described above in section 6.(i).

Nevertheless, the RA training hypothesis appears to have
been confirmed again, since the scores of trainees who produced
over-noise events were concentrated in the latter portions of
their training process. Apparently showing a reversal of this
trend. however, three individuals produced events of over-noise
magnitude in their first session. One participant produced no
further over-noise RA events after the two she produced in her
first training session. Perhaps the "first time" motivation
factor is an important datum indicating that novelty and high
motivation are possibly important elements in RA performance.
This implies that motivational techniques may have fruitful
application in RA training.

The stress of working in a "reward by results" research
environment was felt by all members of the JFKU research team and
may have negatively impacted results, because of the anxiety it
produced. It was :ade clear that refunding for the 1987/88
research cycle depended on the results from the present cycle.
The experimenter and participant group showed striking resilience
and good morale in the context of this uncertain and stressful
research environment, and achieved over-threshold and ostensibly
over-noise results under very tightly controlled conditions at
SRl.

The subsequent cut in funding of the SR] psychoenergetics
group has made certain the non-refunding of RA training research
from this source. The study of psychoenergetics needs to be put
onto an assured, stable basis, since no long term research of
magnitude can be based on unstable funding resources. it should
be pointed out that the SRl psychoenergetics group has an
excellent standing within their peer group of professional
researchers in psychoenergetics. and a reduction in their funding
must be very impactful to their efforts. Psychoenergetics
research could lead to important discoveries in physics,
particularly from RA inquiry, and the current instability of
funding will slow the development of better RA target systems,
training procedures and development of possible applications.
Although the identity of the funding source for the SRl
RA psychoenergetics research is not publicly known, it is obvious
that public domain research of this kind must be subject to
monitoring by the defence community. It is a somewhat bleak
consolation to the JFKU research team to think that the cessation
of this line of research at SRl will probably delay the
development of RA training for destructive military purposes,
since the JFKU team is the only group known to be currently in
existence which is pursuing the kind of RA investigations which

APPENDlX ll

RA TRAINING SESSION DATA

The results are given separately, one page or more for each
trainee. The scores achieved in the RA training sessions are
tabulated in rows. Each session occupies one row. Session data
is scored with respect to two parameters. magnitude and event
number.

The first parameter. magnitude, represents the peak signal
of each event detected by the RA detection system. Magnitude
scores are expressed in integer units (counts of the analog to
digital (A/D) converter). One count is equivalent to
approximately 2.5 mV (410 A/D counts per volt). For scores of
magnitude 3 through 10, for each magnitude integer specified at
the top of a column, the number of events of that magnitude
occurring in the session are entered into the appropriate column.
Session scores of zero occurrences of events of any particular
magnitude are represented by spaces in the column where the
number of events of that magnitude would be entered. Null
sessions therefore have no associated scores. Scores in the
"over 10” section are given individually in parentheses. thus, (1
x 12), with the number of events of each magnitude given first,
e.g. (i x 29) being the occurrence of one event of magnitude 29
units. (3 x 14) would represent 3 events each of magnitude 14.

The legend "Sess. No.” is the session number. "RA Syst.” is
the identity of the RA detection system used (systems i or 2).
"Thr. Set.” are the values of the two feedback threshold settings.
The instrumentation incorporated two software selectable
thresholds. The lower threshold was the criterion for entry of
data into the printed record generated by the RA detection
system. The upper threshold defined the signal level which
activated the highest discrete feedback state, leading to
generation of the highest pitched feedback tone and activation of
the highest value feedback light. The first figure of the two
figures under "Thr. Set.” represents the lower threshold, the
second figure is the higher threshold, i.e. figures of 5/300
would represent a lower threshold of S and an upper threshold of
300. Scores were recorded by the system for all signals 1 or
more units above the lower threshold setting. i.e. a threshold
setting of 5 would permit scores of 6 or more to be recorded.

Due to the difference in system noise characteristics
between RA detection system 1 and 2. the threshold settings were
generally set at different levels on system 1 from system 2. it
should be noted from the control run data (APPENDIX 1) that
system 1 noise signals seldom exceeded 2 units. whereas system 2
frequently produced noise signals of 6 units. The largest noise
signal recorded on either device in control runs was 9 units.

Sessions attended at SRl are labelled "SR1 SESSION" and
scores are not given for these sessions.

PZT EXPERIMENT SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND TESTING

The following is a complete description of the PZT hardware and system testing.

A. Design and Construction of the Laboratory Apparatus

1. Sensor Pair and Shielded Enclosure .

Because it was impossible to anticipate every source of artifacts. we initially elected to
use an anti-coincidence sensor design commonly used in experimental physics. We used two
PZTs with differential signal processing. where the output siyial was the absolute value of the
difference between the two sensor voltages. An event of interest was then defined by a
differential signal that exceeded a predetermined voltage threshold. The original intent of this
approach was to assist in rejecting any large-area. unshielded transients (e.g.. low-frequency

magnetic fields or building movement) that might influence the sensors in a manner nearly
equivalent to RA events.

Since we were unable to guarantee complete differential balance for all possible
artifacts. we were unable to rely on common-mode rejection as the sole means of artifact
suppression. Although the operating characteristics (charge-to-voltage conversion. etc.) of one
sensor were balanced to within 10 to 15% of the other sensor's characteristics. a localized source
of excitation (e.g.. acoustic energy) would obviously induce a larger response in the nearer sensor.
Therefore. our characterization and shielding effort focused on the response of the individual

sensor. Since a candidate RA event also had to exceed the differential threshold. this worst-case
approach was the more conservative.

The sensors were a version of a standard commercial piezoelectric ceramic element
offered by several manufacturers in a variety of shapes. sizes. and configurations for applications
ranging from high-voltage generators to low-level sound pickups. Typically these devices are
composed of lead. zirconium. and titanium Oiddes ﬁred into a ceramic at very high temperatures.

The piezoelectric quality is induced by applying a polarizing ﬁeld to the element at its Curie
temperature. For this application. we selected Piezoelectric Product R1018. having dimensions of
1 x 0.125 x 0.005 inches. lts construction is that of a bimorphnessentially a sandwich of two
ceramic slabs and a brass divider. separated by insulating epoxy. This particular PZT is designed
to produce an electric charge when it is ﬂexed laterally.

Approved For Release 2002/11118 : CIA-RDP96-00787R000300300001J

The sensor has natural fundamental and harmonic resonance frequencies that can be
calculated if the physical dimensions are known. Using the dimensions from the preceding
paragraph. the fundamental nodal-support frequency is about 85 kHz. However. it is of no
importance to this application because the expected duration of an RA event ranges from a few
milliseconds to a few tens of milliseconds. Thus. the sensor appears as a virtual flat-amplitude
charge generator with respect to the frequency bands of interest (10 Hz to 1 kHz).

Because the sensor was a charge generator having essentially a pure capacitive source
impedance (well below resonance). the most appropriate signal ampliﬁer was an operational
ampliﬁer configured as a charge amplifier. in addition. use of a high-gain. charge-sensitive
preamplifier eliminated the necessity to transmit very low-level signals over an appreciable
distance. thereby eliminating another potential source of artifacts. The feedback elements in the
charge amplifier were chosen to produce both the low- and high-pass filter corner frequencies of
i kl-iz and 10 Hz. respectively. Because the charge quantities involved were very small. the
amplifier input bias and noise currents were minimized. From the fundamental operating
characteristics of the circuit elements. we calculate that the minimum detectable charge was 2.50
x 10-‘0 coulombs. Because the flexure-mode element had a mechano-electrical transfer

constant of about 4 microcoulombs per millimeter. the equivalent motion for a minimum
detectable signal was about 6 x 10-‘2 centimeters.

Each of the two piezoelectric crystals was suspended from a housing that contained the
charge-sensitive preamplifier that drove a fiber-optic link. The initial sensor physical mount
employed a spherical lead mass suspended by a coil spring. with the PZT attached to the bottom
of the sphere. This mount was very sensitive to rotational oscillation (wobble) at a frequency of
about 8 Hz. The configuration was changed. therefore. to the cage mount shown in Figure 8-1.
In the cage mount. the RA sensor was at the center of gravity of the mass. reducing greatly the
sensitivity to wobble. However. this configuration was the one most easily excited by any lateral
shock applied to the enclosure box.

The mount provided several levels of mechanical isolation. The ﬁrst level of
mechanical isolation was a sensor-enclosure shock mounting of four commercial elastomeric
support pads. Our enclosure weighed about 75 pounds. including the internal batteries. The
weight of the mount. its resonant frequency. spring rate. static deflection. and isolation efﬁciency
entered into the selection. The resulting combined enclosure/mount resonance frequency was no

more than 10 Hz to assure reasonable isolation from any nearby machinery components rotating
at 30 Hz.

The next level of isolation was the sensor suspension system. which was a spring-mass
type with a much lower resonance frequency than the enclosure. As shown. the sensor was

attached to a mount that was suspended from the top of the enclosure on a spring. The weight
was about 2 pounds; the spring rate was selected to provide a resonance frequency of about 2 Hz.
This provided an additional isolation factor of 12 decibels (d8) (6 dB/octave) at the

enclosure/mount resonance frequency of about 10 Hz. Above 10 Hz. the overall isolation was the

sum of the two.

Considerable isolation from low-frequency vibrations (such as those induced by

footsteps and vehicle road “rumble”) was provided by a commercial vibration isolation table.

THE BARE CERAMIC IS COVERED BY A SILICONE LAYER

Because the entire sensor system was electronic. it required shielding from
electromagnetic interference (EMI). The basic sensor enclosure was a standard industry NEMA
12 steel. EMl-shielded box (Figure 8—2) having dimensions of 20 x 16 x 6 inches. According to
the manufacturer’s specifications. this box provides up to 95 dB of magnetic—field shielding from
14 kHz to 1 megahertz (MHz) and over 100 dB of electric field shielding from 14 kHz to at least
450 MHz. Performance is degraded. however, if any openings are made in the steel case. The
only hole through the shell is 3 1/4—inch opening for the fiber—optic cables: 3 Straightforward

calculation can demonstrate that signals must be greater than about 10 gigahertz (GHz) to

propagate through this opening. The enclosure housed two PZTs with preamplifiers and drivers.
The PZTs were coated with a silicone insulator to provide elecrrical insulation and conductive
silver paint to shield against EMI. All PZT instrumentation within the shielded enclosure was
powered by rechargeable batteries. The primary danger from stray fields (field-to-cable coupling
outside the shielded enclosure) was eliminated entirely by using fiber—optic cables to carry the
signal to the external hardware. Two more fiber—optic modems were added before data collection

to transmit duplicate signals to the tape recorder.

Because all interconnect wires in the enclosure were shielded coaxial or
multiconductor cables. they were relatively immune to extraneous fields. A single-point common

ground was used to minimize ground l00p currents and the associated signal-noise voltages.

As discussed in Section B. “Transducer Susceptibilities." our basic shielded enclosure
(with the door tightly clamped) also provided about 40 dB of acoustic attenuation and protected

the sensors against visible light and infrared environmental transients.

2. Signal Transmission and Processing

a. Feedback and Control

A microprocessor controller programmed in BASIC provided the operator
interface. feedback control. and transmission of data to both the printer and the experimenter’s
keyboard and display (TRS model 102 computer). The data consisted of time of event. voltage
from sensor one (V.). voltage from sensor two (V3). and the absolute value of the difference
between V. and V2. Only data above a set differential threshold were printed. This threshold was
adjustable for each participant’s personal characteristics. These data were fed to two serial ports
on the back of the controller: one was connected to the printer. and the Other to the TRS model
102 computer. The controller also provided chart recorder output for each of the two sensors.

The signals from the piezoelectric sensor preamplifier were transmitted to the
microprocessor controller via voltage-to-frequency converters. optic transmitters. and two
20-meter fiber-optic cables. This effectively isolated the battery-powered sensor and its circuitry
from the line-powered controller circuitry. The ﬁber-optic link was a one-way transmission line:
no components could reverse the process and send spurious signals back to the sensor enclosure.
The controller converted these signals back into voltages using a fiber-optic receiver followed by a
frequency-to-voitage converter. All signals were then ﬁltered and full wave rectified. The

high-pass filter time constant was selected using software to be either 100 or 30. while the
low-pass filter bandwidth was fixed at 1 kHz.

The RA system was designed to detect signals having a duration on the order of
milliseconds. Such a signal is obviously too fast for any meaningful feedback to a participant. To
accommodate a typical human perception threshold. therefore. the signals were fed to fast-attack
slow-decay circuits that had a decay time constant of 1.5 seconds. This decay was slow enough to
allow the participant to observe the sensor output via the feedback that was derived directly from
the stretched signals. The chart recorder outputs were derived from the pulse stretchers as well.

Peak voltages detected by the two channels were digitized and the remainder of
the processing was done using software. A high speed. analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
sampled a channel every 50 microseconds. in addition. two monitor circuits continuously
examined the ﬁber-optic links and sensor battery voltages. These circuits were polled each time a
data sample was obtained. if either circuit detected a deviation from preset limits. data collection
was interrupted by an error message that invalidated all values. This check of the link and
voltages could also be initiated manually from the operator's keyboard.

Figure 8-3 shows the typical output of the two PZTs. as recorded after

transmission through the 20-meter fiber—optic lines. As can be determined from the strip-chart

During the entire experiment we used Consolidated Electrodynamics
Corporation recording tape (0.5 inch x 4.600 feet). Each tape was new. still sealed in the original
manufacturer’s packaging. Before each data recording session. the recorder heads were cleaned
in accordance with the maintenance manual. The Ampex recorder was thoroughly serviced. and
all record and playback amplifiers were calibrated. We selected a tape speed of 7.5 inches per
second. providing approximately 90 minutes of recording time. the length of a typical RA session.
At that speed. our dynamic range was 43 dB in the critical range of dc to 5 kHz. The gain of 50
in our PZT signal interface was selected to guarantee that the PZT noise signal would be clearly
detectable above the recorder noise. Data playback was performed using the same recorder in
exacuy the same conﬁguration as that used during recording. All data tapes were stored in the
locked and guarded sensor room. inside the artifact boundary.

Power for the tape recorder was supplied from a TOPAZ power conditioner.

which is designed to ﬁlter common-mode and differential-mode noise and to regulate surges in
line voltage.

3. Participant Feedback

Although the physics and engineering of the piezoelectric sensor systems were the
primary responsibility of SRl. an area of considerable overlap with the JFK staff was structuring
the audible and visual feedback to satisfy both psychological and technical criteria. Previous
experience had shown that the participant needed to receive real-time feedback of the activity of
the sensor noise output in order to establish contact. ' This requirement follows directly from the

JFK staff claim that operant conditioning and bio-feedback are key elements to training RA
ability.

in addition to the active feedback equipment shown in Figure 13-4. full color
photographs of both sensors and the enclosure were made. Enlargements of these pictures were
posted in the participant's area as additional aids in making contact.

There are three modes of operation for the feedback: channel A. channel 3. or
differential. Channel A used only the signal from sensor A to drive the feedback. Channel B
selected the signal from sensor B for feedback. Differential mode drove the feedback using the
absolute value of the difference between the two sensor signals (IA - 8|). During all experimental

For feedback. two thresholds were chosen: To and T,. where T. was greater than To.
These threshold values were selected and served to divide the signal amplitude (s) into three
categories: 5 < To. To < s < T“ and s > 1“. For signal values below To. an audible “click" was
generated. the frequency of which was determined by variations in the system output amplitude.
The visual display was not acuve below To. For signals between To and Th both the audible and
visual feedback became acuve. The audible feedback was selected from the eight tones of the
major chromatic scale (beginning with middle C and going up an octave). The eight colored lucite
bars of the visual display were illuminated in step with their respective tones. The update rate for
the feedback was such that the decaying signal could be clearly seen and heard as a series of tones
decreasing in pitch. Signals having an amplitude above T, caused a cassette tape recorder to turn
on and to play a tape selected by the participant. The cassette remained on for a period set by
the experimenter. during which time all signals from the sensors were ignored.

B. Transducer Susceptibilities

During 1987. a substantial effort at SRl was directed toward characterizing the transducer
susceptibilities. environmental monitoring. physical security. and shielding of the sensor

environment. We tested the RA system response in accordance with the expected RA signals. In

discussion with the JFK staff. we adopted as the goal for the FY 1987 study a signal amplitude of

' 50-mV output from the feedback apparatus. This value was used in all subsequent susceptibility
testing as a reference point only. The only authoritative test of the RA hypothesis was a
comparison of the maximum control trial voltage (Vc) with the effort period maximum (Ve). A
brief summary of the scope ‘of this effort follows.

1. Electric and Magnetic Fields

in this and all following susceptibility measurements, both the test stimulus voltage and
the RA sensor response voltage were digitized by a low-frequency signal analyzer
(Scientific-Atlanta model SD—3802) and the complex (amplitude and phase) transfer function
was calculated. A transfer function is a ratio of the input voltage to Output voltage as a funcuon of
frequency. It demonstrates the sensitivity of a system to external influences. The amplitude-time

waveforms. the corresponding spectra. and the calculated transfer function were all printed on
hard copy for storage in the archives.

Electric field susceptibility was measured by inserting the piezoelectric element
between the plates of a parallel-plate field antenna driven by a low-impedance arbitrary
waveform generator. TeSt voltages'(pulse and sine wave) of up to 20 V peak-to-peak amplitude
were applied with a resultant interior ﬁeld strength of 3.150 V/cm. No RA system signals could be
seen using the elecu'ic field generator with sine or pulse signals having frequencies up to 10 kHz.
We attribute this insensitivity primarily to the conductive silver paint covering the sensors.

Magnetic ﬁeld susceptibility was measured using a specially fabricated Helmholtz coil
driven by a voltage pulse generator. The resulting coil current was used as the reference signal.
The Helmholtz coil was calibrated against a commercial Gaussmeter (Bell model 610). Both the

Helmholtz current and the RA response voltage were applied to the signal analyzer for
measurement and comparison.

Current to the coil was switched on. held at about 1.5 amperes (A) (7.5 gauss [0]) for
about 18 milliseconds. and then switched off. The RA sensor response to this stepped magnetic
field was essentially an impulse with little time or frequency structure. A nearly uniform response
of the sensor and the lack of a low-frequency component implies that the effect was essentially
proportional to the time rate-of—change in a magnetic ﬁeld.

As shown in Figure 8-5. the calculated transfer function indicates an initial increase in
output with frequency. peaking around 1 kHz. and then a decay. We believe the rise with
frequency was caused by the charge induced in the RA charge amplifier by the magnetic field
“cutting” the loop formed by the charge amplifier. the PZT sensor plate capacitance. and the

interconnect wiring. This loop lies in the X-plane of the enclosure and perpendicular to the
piezoelectric element. When the Helmholtz coil was routed 90°. the system response dropped
markedly. it is not clear whether the piezoelectric element contributed to this effect.

FIGURE 8-5 MAGNETIC FIELD TRANSFER FUNCTION

The sensor response increased when a static magnetic field (from a permanent
magnet) was near the sensor during the pulse testing. in this case. a large static field appeared to
change the piezoelectric polarization or some other electrical characteristic. This auxiliary field
was quite Strong—-hundreds of gauss-—and stronger than would be encountered under RA testing
conditions. We performed subsequent tests without the pulsed ﬁeld but with the shielded box
closed. In those experiments. a 1.4-kilogauss (kG) permanent magnet did not produce any

measurable output when held stationary or waved (~ 5 Hz) within a few centimeters of the
enclosure.

Using the peak value of the excitation step function 7.5 G. and the peak response of
the RA system. about 0.1 V. we arrived at a susceptibility coefficient of about 13 mV/G. To

produce an RA system signal of 50 mV. the sensors would require a transient of about 3.8 G--a
value approximately seven times that of the earth's ambient magnetic field. For this to occur. that
magnetic field would have to change fast: in less than a fraction of a millisecond.

The RA sensor enclosure was fabricated from mild steel. primarily to provide
insulation from high-frequency electromagnetic fields. Published theory is weak regarding
shielding of low-frequency magnetic fields. so a simple test was performed to determine whether
the box provided any isolation. A single coil of twenty turns of wire was formed onto a cardboard
box that was about 2 x 3 feet. A current of 1.5 A was applied. and the interior field measured to

be about 0.5 G. The entire sensor package was placed inside and the coil activated with various
current waveforms.

To offset the lower field strength. the measurement sensitivity was enhanced by
choosing a waveform that was a sine sweep over the 50- to 10.000-Hz range. This resulted in
about the same spectral density as that produced in the small Helmholtz coil under step-function
excitation. The RA system response was quite small (about 7 mV at peak). and the associated
spectrum showed one predominant peak at about 1.95 kHz. Special mm were run with a pulsed.
continuous-wave (CW) magnch field current at that particular frequency. and. indeed. a
relatively large response could be induced. Even in this case. however. with the excitation pulse
length in excess of 20 milliseconds. the peak response was barely 20 mV.

The conclusion is that the steel box appeared to provide some isolation since the
response for similar excitation field strength spectral density (in G/Hz) at the sensor was smaller
with the steel box than without it. The observed resonance response in the latter case appeared to
result from circuitry in the box other than the piezoelectric sensor. Because shielding against
low-frequency magnetic fields is difﬁcult. we incorporated a magnetic field antenna into our

environmental monitoring. if unusually large magnch ﬁeld transients occurred. then we could
discriminate them from candidate RA events.

2. Shock and Vibration Susceptibility

To determine the sensors’ susceptibility to vibration. a shock was applied to induce a
peak acceleration of slightly less than l-g to the RA enclosure. The enclosure was struck at a
point aligned with the unit's center of gravity in each of the three orthogonal axes to induce lateral
translational motion. The aetual applied acceleration was measured with three calibrated
accelerometers affixed to the enclosure along the three primary physical axes. These axes
corresponded to the front. side. and top surfaces of the enclosure box.

The transfer function. shown in figure B-6. conﬁrmed that a predominant resonance
occurred at about 8 Hz. Other peaks were substantially lower. except for one at about 68 Hz and
an0ther at about 138 Hz.

FIGURE 8-6 SHOCK AND MECHANICAL VIBRATION TRANSFER FUNCTION

As described earlier. we assumed an RA system output of 50 mV. Applying the
measured shock transfer coefﬁcient of 0.65 V/g yielded an equivalent shock threshold of 76 mg.
Because this value for vibration and shock was small. the amount of environmental isolation had
to be large. We obtained this isolation for the RA sensor enclosure by using the air-suspension.
large-mass vibration isolation table and the elastomeric support pads described in Section A of
this Appendix. The ﬂoat table had a resonance of about 1 Hz for light loads and was hean‘ly
damped. providing an isolation of 12 dB per octave. This ﬁgure implies an attenuation of 36 dB
at the lowest system resonance of 8 Hz; therefore. a floor acceleration of 4.8-g would be required
to produce 50-mV events. We field tested this isolation by dropping a mass of more than 100

kilograms from a height of 75 centimeters within less than a meter of the table. Since the sensor

room was on the top ﬂoor of the building. this experiment was repeated on the roof directly above
the sensor enclosure. No signiﬁcant RA system output was observed in either case.

Although this testing and characterization indicated the sensor output was not
susceptible to outside vibrations. we attached an accelerometer to the sensor entlosure to record

any extraordinary vibration (e.g.. earthquakes) that might occur during an RA session and create
signals.

3. Acoustic Excitation

We measured the acoustic susceptibility of the piezoelectric transducers in the audible
range of 20 to 20. 000 Hz. All power levels were expressed in decibels As a practical reference.
40 to 50 dB is the level of the average quiet residence: average trafﬁc at a distance of 100 feet is

60 to 70 dB; and heavy traffic may be 70 to 80 dB. The threshold of sound discomfort is about
118 dB. and hearing impairment occurs at about 140 dB.

The source of the acoustic excitation was a commercial audio speaker unit that
consisted of a combination low/mid-range woofer and a high-range tweeter. both in a bass-re flex
enclosure to extend low-frequency response down to less than 30 Hz. Maximum acoustic power
was less than 10 watts (W) input. The speaker system was driven by a standard audio-power
amplifier that was fed arbitrary signal waveforms from an audio-function generator. Pulse.
pulse-CW. and FM CW (chirp) waveforms were used to excite the test unit.

Sound level at the PZT sensors was measured using a Bruel and Kjaer (B-K)
sound-level meter (type 2203) calibrated in decibels (pascals). The meter was used to provide

the complete audio-pressure versus time waveform as deﬁned in the 20- to 20.000-Hz frequency
range. No filters or weighting were employed.

Our test geometry placed the RA sensor and the sound-level meter at the same
distance from the speaker unit. The distance normally employed was about 2 meters. Both the
sensor unit and the speaker were placed about 1 meter above a hard-surface floor inside a large.
high-ceiling room (about 30 x 30 x 15 meters high). No anechoic capability was provided. but

the distance ratio between the direct and any reflected energy was large enough to make
reverberation contamination insigniﬁcant.

Based upon the B-K meter measurements. the sound level at the RA sensor was about
0.8 pascals. Spectral intensity varied somewhat. but in general was flat from 50 Hz to 5 kHz.

Regardless of the source format. the response from the piezoelectric system was quite
complex and can best be described as a multitude of resonance peaks (Figure 3-7). The overall

speCtral response shows most sensitivity was in the 1- to 3-kHz band with predominant resonance

modes near 1.5. 2.0. and 2.5 kHz. These measurements were made with the piezoelectric
element installed inside the steel enclosure but with the enclosure door open.

 

FREQUENCY —— Hz

FIGURE 3-? ACOUSTIC TRANSFER FUNCTION

When the door was closed and tightly clamped. the amplitude of the acoustic response
was markedly reduced (by more than 20 dB). but the spectral character remained the same.
Thus. we concluded that most of the acoustic response was produced by the sensor element itself. ,

An important observation was that the piezoelectric sensor was quite sensitive to
acoustic energy on a time scale that was pertinent to the RA application. The response to a short
acoustic pulse (a few milliseconds duration) was a relatively long-lived “ringing" time waveform
composed of the primary resonances described in preceding paragraphs. Hence. a simple

acoustic transient (produced by a variety of common actions) could induce a sizable and
long-lasting RA artifact.

Even more important was the sensor's extreme sensitivity to discrete CW frequencies
that corresponded to the sensor resonances: a low level “whistle." if of sufﬁcient duration.

sufficiently nearby. and at the correct frequency. could induce a large RA artifact signature.

On an absolute level. a single sensor would produce an artifact of 50 mV if the applied
audio level (in sine-sweep mode) was more than 1 pascal (with the enclosure door open). Given

this acoustic sensitivity. it was necessary that we locate and characterize a sound-attenuating
facility in which to locate the RA system.

Approval was obtained to use an existing soundproof room in Building G of SRl's
Geoscience and Engineering Center. The room had been constructed to meet a sound
transmission class (STC) of 45. STC 45 implies a weighted average attenuation of 45 dB for a
band of frequencies principally in the speech range. To verify this assertion quantitatively. we
employed Ski’s acoustic testing expert to examine the room. Using a calibrated noise source.
precision microphone. and standard measurement techniques. we determined that our facility
provided the acoustic attenuation shown in Figure 8-8. As indicated. transmissions at the critical
resonant frequencies were reduced more than 40 dB. We then positioned the noise source

directly outside the door of the sensor room to simulate an acoustic intrusion. in his summary.
the acoustic consultant stated:

“...a 100 Watt source of pink noise. set for maximum output. was placed in the
hallway. facing both the silencer [ventilation] opening and the door. Measured sound
levels midway between the loudspeaker and the wall were 117 dB. [yet] there was no
detectable interference with the instrumentation in the room."

“To determine the sound level at which interference would occur. the sound source
was placed in the southeast corner of the room. The output was gradually increased
until interference was detected. This was found to occur at a sound level. measured at
the equipment in question. of 91 dB. Therefore...a sound level of approximately 127
dB would be needed in the hallway before interference would occur to the interior
instrumentation. This level is at or above the pain threshold for most people. and its

generation would require at least an audio kilowatt. it is my opinion that room 6-316
is quite satisfactory for its present use." '

Despite these extraordinary measures. some artifact-inducing noise could occur inside
the room. thereby defeating the insulation. To detect such noise. we positioned sensitive
microphones to record the acoustic background continuously during all sessions.

4. Pulsed Infrared Radiation

During the original construction of the RA system. we noticed that the PZTs appeared

to be photosensitive. As a result. we decided to measure the photo-susceptibility of the PZTs
principally in the infrared but also over the visible spectrum.

The source of the thermal illumination was a standard microscope—stage lamp bulb.
Peak temperature was at least 2.700° Kelvin so that the spectral intensity was maximum at the

1.000-nanometer wavelength. Bulb power was at least 15 W and source-to—element distance less
than 18 inches.

To provide a quasi-impulse. the bulb filament was excited by a short-duration current

pulse configured to produce a last temperature increase with a coincident photo energy rise in less

than 50 milliseconds. Thermal pulse decay resulted when the bulb cooled down. The
photo-illumination time waveform was measured using a PIN photodiode operated in the

short-circuit current mode to obtain linear output. Spectral response was that for standard silicon
devices and covered the visible and near-infrared region.

Based upon the current waveform measurements and the filament cold resistance. the
input energy was about 1.2 joules. From the measured optic pulse waveform and the geometry.
the peak power density at the sensor element was about 60 milliwatts per square centimeter.

The thermal pulse applied to the piezoelectric element occurred in about 35
milliseconds and then decayed back to the 10% level in about 150 milliseconds. The piezoelectric

element responded almost immediately (about a 10—millisecond delay) and had a very similar
impulse-type of response (Figure 8-9). Apparently. the thermal energy was absorbed by the
front surface of the sensor. and the ceramic material expanded. forcing the element rod to bend
away from the light source. This bending then induced a charge in the sensor amplifier. which
was observed as the response. The piezoelectric sensor electronic circuitry was AC-coupled;

hence. the response would overshoot on initial rec0very and ring at what appeared to be a thermal
resonance.

Although both the optic power density used for the susceptibility test and the time
rate-of-change were large. they were generated by switching on a simple incandescent lamp and
so can be found in most industrial work areas. The shielding of such thermal pulses is quite easy.
however. because most materials readily absorb and/or reflect the energy. In the case of the PZT
sensors. they were completely enclosed in a steel box having a wall thickness of 1/16 inch. Steel
has a very high thermal mass coefficient and. hence. a long time constant and large energy

absorbing capability. In addition. the lights in the sensor room were always turned off during
experimental sessions and control trials.

5. Ionizing Radiation (01.8.7)

We obtained a variety of radioactive sources in order to examine the possible
susceptibility of the sensors to ionizing radiation. it was suggested that because the transducers
operate as capacitive devices. they might detect a charge deposited by radiation. However. their
electronic structure was not like that of a diode and. therefore. did not resemble a typical
semiconductor radiation detector. Our prediction was that no artifacts would be observed.

elected to incorporate a broad-specuum radiation detector into our environmental monitoring
(the detector is described in the following section).

C. Environmental Monitoring

From the susceptibility testing mentioned above. we determined several types of
instrumentation that were used to monitor environmental conditions during control runs (to

determine the background conditions) as well as during RA data collection. Figures 8-10 and
3-1! show the fully instrumented RA system.

1. Accelerometer (shock and vibration monitoring)

The motion accelerometers were type 508HSILF piezo elements manufactured by the
Vibrometer Company. These devices have a sensitivity factor of 10 mV/G. a noise level of less
than 2 milligauss. and a 3-dB amplitude-frequency response from 0.25 Hz to 10 kHz. They are
approximately 0.5 inch in diameter and 0.8 inch long. A battery-powered excitation/sealer unit
(model P-16) connected the piezoelectric element with the recording instrument. We also added

a 40-d8 wide-band signal amplifier to boost the accelerometer signal at the chart recorder and
tape recorder.

2. Magnetic Field Antenna

We used a ferrite-core magnetic field antenna fabricated at SR1. These antennas
have been used successfully in a wide variety of measurement applications over the last 8 years.
Extensive testing has demonstrated that the battery-powered antennas are very stable with time.
possessing a response characteristic that is extremely fiat from about 250 Hz to more than 25
kHz. From dc to 250 Hz. the response of the antenna is very similar to that of the piezoelectric
element. making the antenna extremely well suited to artifact detection.

3. Calibrated Microphones (acoustic monitoring)

Two Nakamichi CM 100. recording quality microphones were used to detect potential
acoustic artifacts. Their frequency response is essentially flat from 30 Hz to 18 kHz. thereby
entirely covering the sensitive region of the piezoelectric sensors. We independently verified the
frequency response using the B-K sound-level meter described earlier. Since each microphone
has a cardioid spatial pattern. two units were employed--facing away from each other—-to ensure
a spherical pickup geometry.

4. Sodium Iodide Detector (ionizing radiation detection)

Our ionizing radiation detector (Canberra Industries Model 802—3) was an industry
standard. 2-inch-diameter sodium iodide scintillation crystal affixed to a photomultiplier tube.
The combined unit had a charge output directly proportional to the incident energy of the
radiation. A charge-sensitive preamplifier (Canberra Model 2007-P) and

Gaussian—shaping—pulse amplifier produced a 0- to lO—V signal {or subsequent digitization.
